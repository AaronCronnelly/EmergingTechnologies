#Task 1
For the first task, we had to take books from [Project GutenBerg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). From this we then had to create a model of the english language that would take the contents of the book and only using ASCII the contents would be taken to all UpperCase. After this we had to create a trigram model by counting the number of times each sequence of three characters appears.
