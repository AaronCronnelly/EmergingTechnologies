FINALE.PRELUDE.WHO THAT CARES MUCH TO KNOW THE HISTORY OF MAN AND HOW THE MYSTERIOUSMIXTURE BEHAVES UNDER THE VARYING EXPERIMENTS OF TIME HAS NOT DWELTAT LEAST BRIEFLY ON THE LIFE OF SAINT THERESA HAS NOT SMILED WITHSOME GENTLENESS AT THE THOUGHT OF THE LITTLE GIRL WALKING FORTH ONEMORNING HANDINHAND WITH HER STILL SMALLER BROTHER TO GO AND SEEKMARTYRDOM IN THE COUNTRY OF THE MOORS OUT THEY TODDLED FROM RUGGEDAVILA WIDEEYED AND HELPLESSLOOKING AS TWO FAWNS BUT WITH HUMANHEARTS ALREADY BEATING TO A NATIONAL IDEA UNTIL DOMESTIC REALITY METTHEM IN THE SHAPE OF UNCLES AND TURNED THEM BACK FROM THEIR GREATRESOLVE. THAT CHILDPILGRIMAGE WAS A FIT BEGINNING. THERESASPASSIONATE IDEAL NATURE DEMANDED AN EPIC LIFE WHAT WERE MANYVOLUMEDROMANCES OF CHIVALRY AND THE SOCIAL CONQUESTS OF A BRILLIANT GIRL TOHER HER FLAME QUICKLY BURNED UP THAT LIGHT FUEL AND FED FROM WITHINSOARED AFTER SOME ILLIMITABLE SATISFACTION SOME OBJECT WHICH WOULDNEVER JUSTIFY WEARINESS WHICH WOULD RECONCILE SELFDESPAIR WITH THERAPTUROUS CONSCIOUSNESS OF LIFE BEYOND SELF. SHE FOUND HER EPOS IN THEREFORM OF A RELIGIOUS ORDER.THAT SPANISH WOMAN WHO LIVED THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO WAS CERTAINLY NOTTHE LAST OF HER KIND. MANY THERESAS HAVE BEEN BORN WHO FOUND FORTHEMSELVES NO EPIC LIFE WHEREIN THERE WAS A CONSTANT UNFOLDING OFFARRESONANT ACTION PERHAPS ONLY A LIFE OF MISTAKES THE OFFSPRING OFA CERTAIN SPIRITUAL GRANDEUR ILLMATCHED WITH THE MEANNESS OFOPPORTUNITY PERHAPS A TRAGIC FAILURE WHICH FOUND NO SACRED POET ANDSANK UNWEPT INTO OBLIVION. WITH DIM LIGHTS AND TANGLED CIRCUMSTANCETHEY TRIED TO SHAPE THEIR THOUGHT AND DEED IN NOBLE AGREEMENT BUTAFTER ALL TO COMMON EYES THEIR STRUGGLES SEEMED MERE INCONSISTENCY ANDFORMLESSNESS FOR THESE LATERBORN THERESAS WERE HELPED BY NO COHERENTSOCIAL FAITH AND ORDER WHICH COULD PERFORM THE FUNCTION OF KNOWLEDGEFOR THE ARDENTLY WILLING SOUL. THEIR ARDOR ALTERNATED BETWEEN A VAGUEIDEAL AND THE COMMON YEARNING OF WOMANHOOD SO THAT THE ONE WASDISAPPROVED AS EXTRAVAGANCE AND THE OTHER CONDEMNED AS A LAPSE.SOME HAVE FELT THAT THESE BLUNDERING LIVES ARE DUE TO THE INCONVENIENTINDEFINITENESS WITH WHICH THE SUPREME POWER HAS FASHIONED THE NATURESOF WOMEN IF THERE WERE ONE LEVEL OF FEMININE INCOMPETENCE AS STRICT ASTHE ABILITY TO COUNT THREE AND NO MORE THE SOCIAL LOT OF WOMEN MIGHTBE TREATED WITH SCIENTIFIC CERTITUDE. MEANWHILE THE INDEFINITENESSREMAINS AND THE LIMITS OF VARIATION ARE REALLY MUCH WIDER THAN ANY ONEWOULD IMAGINE FROM THE SAMENESS OF WOMENS COIFFURE AND THE FAVORITELOVESTORIES IN PROSE AND VERSE. HERE AND THERE A CYGNET IS REAREDUNEASILY AMONG THE DUCKLINGS IN THE BROWN POND AND NEVER FINDS THELIVING STREAM IN FELLOWSHIP WITH ITS OWN OARYFOOTED KIND. HERE ANDTHERE IS BORN A SAINT THERESA FOUNDRESS OF NOTHING WHOSE LOVINGHEARTBEATS AND SOBS AFTER AN UNATTAINED GOODNESS TREMBLE OFF AND AREDISPERSED AMONG HINDRANCES INSTEAD OF CENTRING IN SOMELONGRECOGNIZABLE DEED.BOOK I.MISS BROOKE.CHAPTER I.SINCE I CAN DO NO GOOD BECAUSE A WOMANREACH CONSTANTLY AT SOMETHING THAT IS NEAR IT.                    THE MAIDS TRAGEDY BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.MISS BROOKE HAD THAT KIND OF BEAUTY WHICH SEEMS TO BE THROWN INTORELIEF BY POOR DRESS. HER HAND AND WRIST WERE SO FINELY FORMED THAT SHECOULD WEAR SLEEVES NOT LESS BARE OF STYLE THAN THOSE IN WHICH THEBLESSED VIRGIN APPEARED TO ITALIAN PAINTERS AND HER PROFILE AS WELL ASHER STATURE AND BEARING SEEMED TO GAIN THE MORE DIGNITY FROM HER PLAINGARMENTS WHICH BY THE SIDE OF PROVINCIAL FASHION GAVE HER THEIMPRESSIVENESS OF A FINE QUOTATION FROM THE BIBLEOR FROM ONE OF OURELDER POETSIN A PARAGRAPH OF TODAYS NEWSPAPER. SHE WAS USUALLYSPOKEN OF AS BEING REMARKABLY CLEVER BUT WITH THE ADDITION THAT HERSISTER CELIA HAD MORE COMMONSENSE. NEVERTHELESS CELIA WORE SCARCELYMORE TRIMMINGS AND IT WAS ONLY TO CLOSE OBSERVERS THAT HER DRESSDIFFERED FROM HER SISTERS AND HAD A SHADE OF COQUETRY IN ITSARRANGEMENTS FOR MISS BROOKES PLAIN DRESSING WAS DUE TO MIXEDCONDITIONS IN MOST OF WHICH HER SISTER SHARED. THE PRIDE OF BEINGLADIES HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT THE BROOKE CONNECTIONS THOUGH NOTEXACTLY ARISTOCRATIC WERE UNQUESTIONABLY GOOD IF YOU INQUIREDBACKWARD FOR A GENERATION OR TWO YOU WOULD NOT FIND ANY YARDMEASURINGOR PARCELTYING FOREFATHERSANYTHING LOWER THAN AN ADMIRAL OR ACLERGYMAN AND THERE WAS EVEN AN ANCESTOR DISCERNIBLE AS A PURITANGENTLEMAN WHO SERVED UNDER CROMWELL BUT AFTERWARDS CONFORMED ANDMANAGED TO COME OUT OF ALL POLITICAL TROUBLES AS THE PROPRIETOR OF ARESPECTABLE FAMILY ESTATE. YOUNG WOMEN OF SUCH BIRTH LIVING IN A QUIETCOUNTRYHOUSE AND ATTENDING A VILLAGE CHURCH HARDLY LARGER THAN APARLOR NATURALLY REGARDED FRIPPERY AS THE AMBITION OF A HUCKSTERSDAUGHTER. THEN THERE WAS WELLBRED ECONOMY WHICH IN THOSE DAYS MADESHOW IN DRESS THE FIRST ITEM TO BE DEDUCTED FROM WHEN ANY MARGIN WASREQUIRED FOR EXPENSES MORE DISTINCTIVE OF RANK. SUCH REASONS WOULD HAVEBEEN ENOUGH TO ACCOUNT FOR PLAIN DRESS QUITE APART FROM RELIGIOUSFEELING BUT IN MISS BROOKES CASE RELIGION ALONE WOULD HAVEDETERMINED IT AND CELIA MILDLY ACQUIESCED IN ALL HER SISTERSSENTIMENTS ONLY INFUSING THEM WITH THAT COMMONSENSE WHICH IS ABLE TOACCEPT MOMENTOUS DOCTRINES WITHOUT ANY ECCENTRIC AGITATION. DOROTHEAKNEW MANY PASSAGES OF PASCALS PENSEES AND OF JEREMY TAYLOR BY HEARTAND TO HER THE DESTINIES OF MANKIND SEEN BY THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIANITYMADE THE SOLICITUDES OF FEMININE FASHION APPEAR AN OCCUPATION FORBEDLAM. SHE COULD NOT RECONCILE THE ANXIETIES OF A SPIRITUAL LIFEINVOLVING ETERNAL CONSEQUENCES WITH A KEEN INTEREST IN GIMP ANDARTIFICIAL PROTRUSIONS OF DRAPERY. HER MIND WAS THEORETIC AND YEARNEDBY ITS NATURE AFTER SOME LOFTY CONCEPTION OF THE WORLD WHICH MIGHTFRANKLY INCLUDE THE PARISH OF TIPTON AND HER OWN RULE OF CONDUCT THERESHE WAS ENAMOURED OF INTENSITY AND GREATNESS AND RASH IN EMBRACINGWHATEVER SEEMED TO HER TO HAVE THOSE ASPECTS LIKELY TO SEEK MARTYRDOMTO MAKE RETRACTATIONS AND THEN TO INCUR MARTYRDOM AFTER ALL IN AQUARTER WHERE SHE HAD NOT SOUGHT IT. CERTAINLY SUCH ELEMENTS IN THECHARACTER OF A MARRIAGEABLE GIRL TENDED TO INTERFERE WITH HER LOT ANDHINDER IT FROM BEING DECIDED ACCORDING TO CUSTOM BY GOOD LOOKSVANITY AND MERELY CANINE AFFECTION. WITH ALL THIS SHE THE ELDER OFTHE SISTERS WAS NOT YET TWENTY AND THEY HAD BOTH BEEN EDUCATED SINCETHEY WERE ABOUT TWELVE YEARS OLD AND HAD LOST THEIR PARENTS ON PLANSAT ONCE NARROW AND PROMISCUOUS FIRST IN AN ENGLISH FAMILY ANDAFTERWARDS IN A SWISS FAMILY AT LAUSANNE THEIR BACHELOR UNCLE ANDGUARDIAN TRYING IN THIS WAY TO REMEDY THE DISADVANTAGES OF THEIRORPHANED CONDITION.IT WAS HARDLY A YEAR SINCE THEY HAD COME TO LIVE AT TIPTON GRANGE WITHTHEIR UNCLE A MAN NEARLY SIXTY OF ACQUIESCENT TEMPER MISCELLANEOUSOPINIONS AND UNCERTAIN VOTE. HE HAD TRAVELLED IN HIS YOUNGER YEARSAND WAS HELD IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTY TO HAVE CONTRACTED A TOORAMBLING HABIT OF MIND. MR. BROOKES CONCLUSIONS WERE AS DIFFICULT TOPREDICT AS THE WEATHER IT WAS ONLY SAFE TO SAY THAT HE WOULD ACT WITHBENEVOLENT INTENTIONS AND THAT HE WOULD SPEND AS LITTLE MONEY ASPOSSIBLE IN CARRYING THEM OUT. FOR THE MOST GLUTINOUSLY INDEFINITEMINDS ENCLOSE SOME HARD GRAINS OF HABIT AND A MAN HAS BEEN SEEN LAXABOUT ALL HIS OWN INTERESTS EXCEPT THE RETENTION OF HIS SNUFFBOXCONCERNING WHICH HE WAS WATCHFUL SUSPICIOUS AND GREEDY OF CLUTCH.IN MR. BROOKE THE HEREDITARY STRAIN OF PURITAN ENERGY WAS CLEARLY INABEYANCE BUT IN HIS NIECE DOROTHEA IT GLOWED ALIKE THROUGH FAULTS ANDVIRTUES TURNING SOMETIMES INTO IMPATIENCE OF HER UNCLES TALK OR HISWAY OF LETTING THINGS BE ON HIS ESTATE AND MAKING HER LONG ALL THEMORE FOR THE TIME WHEN SHE WOULD BE OF AGE AND HAVE SOME COMMAND OFMONEY FOR GENEROUS SCHEMES. SHE WAS REGARDED AS AN HEIRESS FOR NOTONLY HAD THE SISTERS SEVEN HUNDRED AYEAR EACH FROM THEIR PARENTS BUTIF DOROTHEA MARRIED AND HAD A SON THAT SON WOULD INHERIT MR. BROOKESESTATE PRESUMABLY WORTH ABOUT THREE THOUSAND AYEARA RENTAL WHICHSEEMED WEALTH TO PROVINCIAL FAMILIES STILL DISCUSSING MR. PEELS LATECONDUCT ON THE CATHOLIC QUESTION INNOCENT OF FUTURE GOLDFIELDS ANDOF THAT GORGEOUS PLUTOCRACY WHICH HAS SO NOBLY EXALTED THE NECESSITIESOF GENTEEL LIFE.AND HOW SHOULD DOROTHEA NOT MARRYA GIRL SO HANDSOME AND WITH SUCHPROSPECTS NOTHING COULD HINDER IT BUT HER LOVE OF EXTREMES AND HERINSISTENCE ON REGULATING LIFE ACCORDING TO NOTIONS WHICH MIGHT CAUSE AWARY MAN TO HESITATE BEFORE HE MADE HER AN OFFER OR EVEN MIGHT LEADHER AT LAST TO REFUSE ALL OFFERS. A YOUNG LADY OF SOME BIRTH ANDFORTUNE WHO KNELT SUDDENLY DOWN ON A BRICK FLOOR BY THE SIDE OF A SICKLABORER AND PRAYED FERVIDLY AS IF SHE THOUGHT HERSELF LIVING IN THETIME OF THE APOSTLESWHO HAD STRANGE WHIMS OF FASTING LIKE A PAPISTAND OF SITTING UP AT NIGHT TO READ OLD THEOLOGICAL BOOKS SUCH A WIFEMIGHT AWAKEN YOU SOME FINE MORNING WITH A NEW SCHEME FOR THEAPPLICATION OF HER INCOME WHICH WOULD INTERFERE WITH POLITICAL ECONOMYAND THE KEEPING OF SADDLEHORSES A MAN WOULD NATURALLY THINK TWICEBEFORE HE RISKED HIMSELF IN SUCH FELLOWSHIP. WOMEN WERE EXPECTED TOHAVE WEAK OPINIONS BUT THE GREAT SAFEGUARD OF SOCIETY AND OF DOMESTICLIFE WAS THAT OPINIONS WERE NOT ACTED ON. SANE PEOPLE DID WHAT THEIRNEIGHBORS DID SO THAT IF ANY LUNATICS WERE AT LARGE ONE MIGHT KNOWAND AVOID THEM.THE RURAL OPINION ABOUT THE NEW YOUNG LADIES EVEN AMONG THE COTTAGERSWAS GENERALLY IN FAVOR OF CELIA AS BEING SO AMIABLE ANDINNOCENTLOOKING WHILE MISS BROOKES LARGE EYES SEEMED LIKE HERRELIGION TOO UNUSUAL AND STRIKING. POOR DOROTHEA COMPARED WITH HERTHE INNOCENTLOOKING CELIA WAS KNOWING AND WORLDLYWISE SO MUCHSUBTLER IS A HUMAN MIND THAN THE OUTSIDE TISSUES WHICH MAKE A SORT OFBLAZONRY OR CLOCKFACE FOR IT.YET THOSE WHO APPROACHED DOROTHEA THOUGH PREJUDICED AGAINST HER BYTHIS ALARMING HEARSAY FOUND THAT SHE HAD A CHARM UNACCOUNTABLYRECONCILABLE WITH IT. MOST MEN THOUGHT HER BEWITCHING WHEN SHE WAS ONHORSEBACK. SHE LOVED THE FRESH AIR AND THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THECOUNTRY AND WHEN HER EYES AND CHEEKS GLOWED WITH MINGLED PLEASURE SHELOOKED VERY LITTLE LIKE A DEVOTEE. RIDING WAS AN INDULGENCE WHICH SHEALLOWED HERSELF IN SPITE OF CONSCIENTIOUS QUALMS SHE FELT THAT SHEENJOYED IT IN A PAGAN SENSUOUS WAY AND ALWAYS LOOKED FORWARD TORENOUNCING IT.SHE WAS OPEN ARDENT AND NOT IN THE LEAST SELFADMIRING INDEED ITWAS PRETTY TO SEE HOW HER IMAGINATION ADORNED HER SISTER CELIA WITHATTRACTIONS ALTOGETHER SUPERIOR TO HER OWN AND IF ANY GENTLEMANAPPEARED TO COME TO THE GRANGE FROM SOME OTHER MOTIVE THAN THAT OFSEEING MR. BROOKE SHE CONCLUDED THAT HE MUST BE IN LOVE WITH CELIASIR JAMES CHETTAM FOR EXAMPLE WHOM SHE CONSTANTLY CONSIDERED FROMCELIAS POINT OF VIEW INWARDLY DEBATING WHETHER IT WOULD BE GOOD FORCELIA TO ACCEPT HIM. THAT HE SHOULD BE REGARDED AS A SUITOR TO HERSELFWOULD HAVE SEEMED TO HER A RIDICULOUS IRRELEVANCE. DOROTHEA WITH ALLHER EAGERNESS TO KNOW THE TRUTHS OF LIFE RETAINED VERY CHILDLIKE IDEASABOUT MARRIAGE. SHE FELT SURE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED THEJUDICIOUS HOOKER IF SHE HAD BEEN BORN IN TIME TO SAVE HIM FROM THATWRETCHED MISTAKE HE MADE IN MATRIMONY OR JOHN MILTON WHEN HISBLINDNESS HAD COME ON OR ANY OF THE OTHER GREAT MEN WHOSE ODD HABITSIT WOULD HAVE BEEN GLORIOUS PIETY TO ENDURE BUT AN AMIABLE HANDSOMEBARONET WHO SAID EXACTLY TO HER REMARKS EVEN WHEN SHE EXPRESSEDUNCERTAINTYHOW COULD HE AFFECT HER AS A LOVER THE REALLY DELIGHTFULMARRIAGE MUST BE THAT WHERE YOUR HUSBAND WAS A SORT OF FATHER ANDCOULD TEACH YOU EVEN HEBREW IF YOU WISHED IT.THESE PECULIARITIES OF DOROTHEAS CHARACTER CAUSED MR. BROOKE TO BE ALLTHE MORE BLAMED IN NEIGHBORING FAMILIES FOR NOT SECURING SOMEMIDDLEAGED LADY AS GUIDE AND COMPANION TO HIS NIECES. BUT HE HIMSELFDREADED SO MUCH THE SORT OF SUPERIOR WOMAN LIKELY TO BE AVAILABLE FORSUCH A POSITION THAT HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE DISSUADED BY DOROTHEASOBJECTIONS AND WAS IN THIS CASE BRAVE ENOUGH TO DEFY THE WORLDTHAT ISTO SAY MRS. CADWALLADER THE RECTORS WIFE AND THE SMALL GROUP OFGENTRY WITH WHOM HE VISITED IN THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF LOAMSHIRE. SOMISS BROOKE PRESIDED IN HER UNCLES HOUSEHOLD AND DID NOT AT ALLDISLIKE HER NEW AUTHORITY WITH THE HOMAGE THAT BELONGED TO IT.SIR JAMES CHETTAM WAS GOING TO DINE AT THE GRANGE TODAY WITH ANOTHERGENTLEMAN WHOM THE GIRLS HAD NEVER SEEN AND ABOUT WHOM DOROTHEA FELTSOME VENERATING EXPECTATION. THIS WAS THE REVEREND EDWARD CASAUBONNOTED IN THE COUNTY AS A MAN OF PROFOUND LEARNING UNDERSTOOD FOR MANYYEARS TO BE ENGAGED ON A GREAT WORK CONCERNING RELIGIOUS HISTORY ALSOAS A MAN OF WEALTH ENOUGH TO GIVE LUSTRE TO HIS PIETY AND HAVING VIEWSOF HIS OWN WHICH WERE TO BE MORE CLEARLY ASCERTAINED ON THE PUBLICATIONOF HIS BOOK. HIS VERY NAME CARRIED AN IMPRESSIVENESS HARDLY TO BEMEASURED WITHOUT A PRECISE CHRONOLOGY OF SCHOLARSHIP.EARLY IN THE DAY DOROTHEA HAD RETURNED FROM THE INFANT SCHOOL WHICH SHEHAD SET GOING IN THE VILLAGE AND WAS TAKING HER USUAL PLACE IN THEPRETTY SITTINGROOM WHICH DIVIDED THE BEDROOMS OF THE SISTERS BENT ONFINISHING A PLAN FOR SOME BUILDINGS A KIND OF WORK WHICH SHE DELIGHTEDIN WHEN CELIA WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING HER WITH A HESITATING DESIRE TOPROPOSE SOMETHING SAIDDOROTHEA DEAR IF YOU DONT MINDIF YOU ARE NOT VERY BUSYSUPPOSE WELOOKED AT MAMMAS JEWELS TODAY AND DIVIDED THEM IT IS EXACTLY SIXMONTHS TODAY SINCE UNCLE GAVE THEM TO YOU AND YOU HAVE NOT LOOKED ATTHEM YET.CELIAS FACE HAD THE SHADOW OF A POUTING EXPRESSION IN IT THE FULLPRESENCE OF THE POUT BEING KEPT BACK BY AN HABITUAL AWE OF DOROTHEA ANDPRINCIPLE TWO ASSOCIATED FACTS WHICH MIGHT SHOW A MYSTERIOUSELECTRICITY IF YOU TOUCHED THEM INCAUTIOUSLY. TO HER RELIEF DOROTHEASEYES WERE FULL OF LAUGHTER AS SHE LOOKED UP.WHAT A WONDERFUL LITTLE ALMANAC YOU ARE CELIA IS IT SIX CALENDAR ORSIX LUNAR MONTHSIT IS THE LAST DAY OF SEPTEMBER NOW AND IT WAS THE FIRST OF APRILWHEN UNCLE GAVE THEM TO YOU. YOU KNOW HE SAID THAT HE HAD FORGOTTENTHEM TILL THEN. I BELIEVE YOU HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF THEM SINCE YOULOCKED THEM UP IN THE CABINET HERE.WELL DEAR WE SHOULD NEVER WEAR THEM YOU KNOW. DOROTHEA SPOKE IN AFULL CORDIAL TONE HALF CARESSING HALF EXPLANATORY. SHE HAD HER PENCILIN HER HAND AND WAS MAKING TINY SIDEPLANS ON A MARGIN.CELIA COLORED AND LOOKED VERY GRAVE. I THINK DEAR WE ARE WANTING INRESPECT TO MAMMAS MEMORY TO PUT THEM BY AND TAKE NO NOTICE OF THEM.AND SHE ADDED AFTER HESITATING A LITTLE WITH A RISING SOB OFMORTIFICATION NECKLACES ARE QUITE USUAL NOW AND MADAME POINCON WHOWAS STRICTER IN SOME THINGS EVEN THAN YOU ARE USED TO WEAR ORNAMENTS.AND CHRISTIANS GENERALLYSURELY THERE ARE WOMEN IN HEAVEN NOW WHO WOREJEWELS. CELIA WAS CONSCIOUS OF SOME MENTAL STRENGTH WHEN SHE REALLYAPPLIED HERSELF TO ARGUMENT.YOU WOULD LIKE TO WEAR THEM EXCLAIMED DOROTHEA AN AIR OF ASTONISHEDDISCOVERY ANIMATING HER WHOLE PERSON WITH A DRAMATIC ACTION WHICH SHEHAD CAUGHT FROM THAT VERY MADAME POINCON WHO WORE THE ORNAMENTS. OFCOURSE THEN LET US HAVE THEM OUT. WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME BEFORE BUTTHE KEYS THE KEYS SHE PRESSED HER HANDS AGAINST THE SIDES OF HERHEAD AND SEEMED TO DESPAIR OF HER MEMORY.THEY ARE HERE SAID CELIA WITH WHOM THIS EXPLANATION HAD BEEN LONGMEDITATED AND PREARRANGED.PRAY OPEN THE LARGE DRAWER OF THE CABINET AND GET OUT THE JEWELBOX.THE CASKET WAS SOON OPEN BEFORE THEM AND THE VARIOUS JEWELS SPREADOUT MAKING A BRIGHT PARTERRE ON THE TABLE. IT WAS NO GREAT COLLECTIONBUT A FEW OF THE ORNAMENTS WERE REALLY OF REMARKABLE BEAUTY THE FINESTTHAT WAS OBVIOUS AT FIRST BEING A NECKLACE OF PURPLE AMETHYSTS SET INEXQUISITE GOLD WORK AND A PEARL CROSS WITH FIVE BRILLIANTS IN IT.DOROTHEA IMMEDIATELY TOOK UP THE NECKLACE AND FASTENED IT ROUND HERSISTERS NECK WHERE IT FITTED ALMOST AS CLOSELY AS A BRACELET BUT THECIRCLE SUITED THE HENRIETTAMARIA STYLE OF CELIAS HEAD AND NECK ANDSHE COULD SEE THAT IT DID IN THE PIERGLASS OPPOSITE.THERE CELIA YOU CAN WEAR THAT WITH YOUR INDIAN MUSLIN. BUT THISCROSS YOU MUST WEAR WITH YOUR DARK DRESSES.CELIA WAS TRYING NOT TO SMILE WITH PLEASURE. O DODO YOU MUST KEEP THECROSS YOURSELF.NO NO DEAR NO SAID DOROTHEA PUTTING UP HER HAND WITH CARELESSDEPRECATION.YES INDEED YOU MUST IT WOULD SUIT YOUIN YOUR BLACK DRESS NOWSAID CELIA INSISTINGLY. YOU MIGHT WEAR THAT.NOT FOR THE WORLD NOT FOR THE WORLD. A CROSS IS THE LAST THING IWOULD WEAR AS A TRINKET. DOROTHEA SHUDDERED SLIGHTLY.THEN YOU WILL THINK IT WICKED IN ME TO WEAR IT SAID CELIA UNEASILY.NO DEAR NO SAID DOROTHEA STROKING HER SISTERS CHEEK. SOULS HAVECOMPLEXIONS TOO WHAT WILL SUIT ONE WILL NOT SUIT ANOTHER.BUT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO KEEP IT FOR MAMMAS SAKE.NO I HAVE OTHER THINGS OF MAMMASHER SANDALWOOD BOX WHICH I AM SOFOND OFPLENTY OF THINGS. IN FACT THEY ARE ALL YOURS DEAR. WE NEEDDISCUSS THEM NO LONGER. THERETAKE AWAY YOUR PROPERTY.CELIA FELT A LITTLE HURT. THERE WAS A STRONG ASSUMPTION OF SUPERIORITYIN THIS PURITANIC TOLERATION HARDLY LESS TRYING TO THE BLOND FLESH OFAN UNENTHUSIASTIC SISTER THAN A PURITANIC PERSECUTION.BUT HOW CAN I WEAR ORNAMENTS IF YOU WHO ARE THE ELDER SISTER WILLNEVER WEAR THEMNAY CELIA THAT IS TOO MUCH TO ASK THAT I SHOULD WEAR TRINKETS TOKEEP YOU IN COUNTENANCE. IF I WERE TO PUT ON SUCH A NECKLACE AS THAT ISHOULD FEEL AS IF I HAD BEEN PIROUETTING. THE WORLD WOULD GO ROUND WITHME AND I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO WALK.CELIA HAD UNCLASPED THE NECKLACE AND DRAWN IT OFF. IT WOULD BE ALITTLE TIGHT FOR YOUR NECK SOMETHING TO LIE DOWN AND HANG WOULD SUITYOU BETTER SHE SAID WITH SOME SATISFACTION. THE COMPLETE UNFITNESSOF THE NECKLACE FROM ALL POINTS OF VIEW FOR DOROTHEA MADE CELIAHAPPIER IN TAKING IT. SHE WAS OPENING SOME RINGBOXES WHICH DISCLOSEDA FINE EMERALD WITH DIAMONDS AND JUST THEN THE SUN PASSING BEYOND ACLOUD SENT A BRIGHT GLEAM OVER THE TABLE.HOW VERY BEAUTIFUL THESE GEMS ARE SAID DOROTHEA UNDER A NEW CURRENTOF FEELING AS SUDDEN AS THE GLEAM. IT IS STRANGE HOW DEEPLY COLORSSEEM TO PENETRATE ONE LIKE SCENT. I SUPPOSE THAT IS THE REASON WHYGEMS ARE USED AS SPIRITUAL EMBLEMS IN THE REVELATION OF ST. JOHN. THEYLOOK LIKE FRAGMENTS OF HEAVEN. I THINK THAT EMERALD IS MORE BEAUTIFULTHAN ANY OF THEM.AND THERE IS A BRACELET TO MATCH IT SAID CELIA. WE DID NOT NOTICETHIS AT FIRST.THEY ARE LOVELY SAID DOROTHEA SLIPPING THE RING AND BRACELET ON HERFINELY TURNED FINGER AND WRIST AND HOLDING THEM TOWARDS THE WINDOW ONA LEVEL WITH HER EYES. ALL THE WHILE HER THOUGHT WAS TRYING TO JUSTIFYHER DELIGHT IN THE COLORS BY MERGING THEM IN HER MYSTIC RELIGIOUS JOY.YOU WOULD LIKE THOSE DOROTHEA SAID CELIA RATHER FALTERINGLYBEGINNING TO THINK WITH WONDER THAT HER SISTER SHOWED SOME WEAKNESSAND ALSO THAT EMERALDS WOULD SUIT HER OWN COMPLEXION EVEN BETTER THANPURPLE AMETHYSTS. YOU MUST KEEP THAT RING AND BRACELETIF NOTHINGELSE. BUT SEE THESE AGATES ARE VERY PRETTY AND QUIET.YES I WILL KEEP THESETHIS RING AND BRACELET SAID DOROTHEA. THENLETTING HER HAND FALL ON THE TABLE SHE SAID IN ANOTHER TONEYET WHATMISERABLE MEN FIND SUCH THINGS AND WORK AT THEM AND SELL THEM SHEPAUSED AGAIN AND CELIA THOUGHT THAT HER SISTER WAS GOING TO RENOUNCETHE ORNAMENTS AS IN CONSISTENCY SHE OUGHT TO DO.YES DEAR I WILL KEEP THESE SAID DOROTHEA DECIDEDLY. BUT TAKE ALLTHE REST AWAY AND THE CASKET.SHE TOOK UP HER PENCIL WITHOUT REMOVING THE JEWELS AND STILL LOOKINGAT THEM. SHE THOUGHT OF OFTEN HAVING THEM BY HER TO FEED HER EYE ATTHESE LITTLE FOUNTAINS OF PURE COLOR.SHALL YOU WEAR THEM IN COMPANY SAID CELIA WHO WAS WATCHING HER WITHREAL CURIOSITY AS TO WHAT SHE WOULD DO.DOROTHEA GLANCED QUICKLY AT HER SISTER. ACROSS ALL HER IMAGINATIVEADORNMENT OF THOSE WHOM SHE LOVED THERE DARTED NOW AND THEN A KEENDISCERNMENT WHICH WAS NOT WITHOUT A SCORCHING QUALITY. IF MISS BROOKEEVER ATTAINED PERFECT MEEKNESS IT WOULD NOT BE FOR LACK OF INWARDFIRE.PERHAPS SHE SAID RATHER HAUGHTILY. I CANNOT TELL TO WHAT LEVEL IMAY SINK.CELIA BLUSHED AND WAS UNHAPPY SHE SAW THAT SHE HAD OFFENDED HERSISTER AND DARED NOT SAY EVEN ANYTHING PRETTY ABOUT THE GIFT OF THEORNAMENTS WHICH SHE PUT BACK INTO THE BOX AND CARRIED AWAY. DOROTHEATOO WAS UNHAPPY AS SHE WENT ON WITH HER PLANDRAWING QUESTIONING THEPURITY OF HER OWN FEELING AND SPEECH IN THE SCENE WHICH HAD ENDED WITHTHAT LITTLE EXPLOSION.CELIAS CONSCIOUSNESS TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN AT ALL IN THEWRONG IT WAS QUITE NATURAL AND JUSTIFIABLE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE ASKEDTHAT QUESTION AND SHE REPEATED TO HERSELF THAT DOROTHEA WASINCONSISTENT EITHER SHE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HER FULL SHARE OF THEJEWELS OR AFTER WHAT SHE HAD SAID SHE SHOULD HAVE RENOUNCED THEMALTOGETHER.I AM SUREAT LEAST I TRUST THOUGHT CELIA THAT THE WEARING OF ANECKLACE WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH MY PRAYERS. AND I DO NOT SEE THAT ISHOULD BE BOUND BY DOROTHEAS OPINIONS NOW WE ARE GOING INTO SOCIETYTHOUGH OF COURSE SHE HERSELF OUGHT TO BE BOUND BY THEM. BUT DOROTHEA ISNOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT.THUS CELIA MUTELY BENDING OVER HER TAPESTRY UNTIL SHE HEARD HERSISTER CALLING HER.HERE KITTY COME AND LOOK AT MY PLAN I SHALL THINK I AM A GREATARCHITECT IF I HAVE NOT GOT INCOMPATIBLE STAIRS AND FIREPLACES.AS CELIA BENT OVER THE PAPER DOROTHEA PUT HER CHEEK AGAINST HERSISTERS ARM CARESSINGLY. CELIA UNDERSTOOD THE ACTION. DOROTHEA SAWTHAT SHE HAD BEEN IN THE WRONG AND CELIA PARDONED HER. SINCE THEYCOULD REMEMBER THERE HAD BEEN A MIXTURE OF CRITICISM AND AWE IN THEATTITUDE OF CELIAS MIND TOWARDS HER ELDER SISTER. THE YOUNGER HADALWAYS WORN A YOKE BUT IS THERE ANY YOKED CREATURE WITHOUT ITS PRIVATEOPINIONSCHAPTER II.DIME NO VES AQUEL CABALLERO QUE HACIA NOSOTROS VIENE SOBRE UNCABALLO RUCIO RODADO QUE TRAE PUESTO EN LA CABEZA UN YELMO DE ORO LOQUE VEO Y COLUMBRO RESPONDIO SANCHO NO ES SINO UN HOMBRE SOBRE UNAS NO PARDO COMO EL MIO QUE TRAE SOBRE LA CABEZA UNA COSA QUERELUMBRA. PUES ESE ES EL YELMO DE MAMBRINO DIJO DONQUIJOTE.CERVANTES.SEEST THOU NOT YON CAVALIER WHO COMETH TOWARD US ON A DAPPLEGRAYSTEED AND WEARETH A GOLDEN HELMET WHAT I SEE ANSWERED SANCHO ISNOTHING BUT A MAN ON A GRAY ASS LIKE MY OWN WHO CARRIES SOMETHINGSHINY ON HIS HEAD. JUST SO ANSWERED DON QUIXOTE AND THATRESPLENDENT OBJECT IS THE HELMET OF MAMBRINO.SIR HUMPHRY DAVY SAID MR. BROOKE OVER THE SOUP IN HIS EASY SMILINGWAY TAKING UP SIR JAMES CHETTAMS REMARK THAT HE WAS STUDYING DAVYSAGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. WELL NOW SIR HUMPHRY DAVY I DINED WITH HIMYEARS AGO AT CARTWRIGHTS AND WORDSWORTH WAS THERE TOOTHE POETWORDSWORTH YOU KNOW. NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING SINGULAR. I WAS ATCAMBRIDGE WHEN WORDSWORTH WAS THERE AND I NEVER MET HIMAND I DINEDWITH HIM TWENTY YEARS AFTERWARDS AT CARTWRIGHTS. THERES AN ODDITY INTHINGS NOW. BUT DAVY WAS THERE HE WAS A POET TOO. OR AS I MAY SAYWORDSWORTH WAS POET ONE AND DAVY WAS POET TWO. THAT WAS TRUE IN EVERYSENSE YOU KNOW.DOROTHEA FELT A LITTLE MORE UNEASY THAN USUAL. IN THE BEGINNING OFDINNER THE PARTY BEING SMALL AND THE ROOM STILL THESE MOTES FROM THEMASS OF A MAGISTRATES MIND FELL TOO NOTICEABLY. SHE WONDERED HOW A MANLIKE MR. CASAUBON WOULD SUPPORT SUCH TRIVIALITY. HIS MANNERS SHETHOUGHT WERE VERY DIGNIFIED THE SET OF HIS IRONGRAY HAIR AND HISDEEP EYESOCKETS MADE HIM RESEMBLE THE PORTRAIT OF LOCKE. HE HAD THESPARE FORM AND THE PALE COMPLEXION WHICH BECAME A STUDENT AS DIFFERENTAS POSSIBLE FROM THE BLOOMING ENGLISHMAN OF THE REDWHISKERED TYPEREPRESENTED BY SIR JAMES CHETTAM.I AM READING THE AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY SAID THIS EXCELLENT BARONETBECAUSE I AM GOING TO TAKE ONE OF THE FARMS INTO MY OWN HANDS AND SEEIF SOMETHING CANNOT BE DONE IN SETTING A GOOD PATTERN OF FARMING AMONGMY TENANTS. DO YOU APPROVE OF THAT MISS BROOKEA GREAT MISTAKE CHETTAM INTERPOSED MR. BROOKE GOING INTOELECTRIFYING YOUR LAND AND THAT KIND OF THING AND MAKING A PARLOR OFYOUR COWHOUSE. IT WONT DO. I WENT INTO SCIENCE A GREAT DEAL MYSELF ATONE TIME BUT I SAW IT WOULD NOT DO. IT LEADS TO EVERYTHING YOU CANLET NOTHING ALONE. NO NOSEE THAT YOUR TENANTS DONT SELL THEIR STRAWAND THAT KIND OF THING AND GIVE THEM DRAININGTILES YOU KNOW. BUTYOUR FANCY FARMING WILL NOT DOTHE MOST EXPENSIVE SORT OF WHISTLE YOUCAN BUY YOU MAY AS WELL KEEP A PACK OF HOUNDS.SURELY SAID DOROTHEA IT IS BETTER TO SPEND MONEY IN FINDING OUTHOW MEN CAN MAKE THE MOST OF THE LAND WHICH SUPPORTS THEM ALL THAN INKEEPING DOGS AND HORSES ONLY TO GALLOP OVER IT. IT IS NOT A SIN TO MAKEYOURSELF POOR IN PERFORMING EXPERIMENTS FOR THE GOOD OF ALL.SHE SPOKE WITH MORE ENERGY THAN IS EXPECTED OF SO YOUNG A LADY BUT SIRJAMES HAD APPEALED TO HER. HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO SO AND SHE HADOFTEN THOUGHT THAT SHE COULD URGE HIM TO MANY GOOD ACTIONS WHEN HE WASHER BROTHERINLAW.MR. CASAUBON TURNED HIS EYES VERY MARKEDLY ON DOROTHEA WHILE SHE WASSPEAKING AND SEEMED TO OBSERVE HER NEWLY.YOUNG LADIES DONT UNDERSTAND POLITICAL ECONOMY YOU KNOW SAID MR.BROOKE SMILING TOWARDS MR. CASAUBON. I REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE ALLREADING ADAM SMITH. THERE IS A BOOK NOW. I TOOK IN ALL THE NEW IDEASAT ONE TIMEHUMAN PERFECTIBILITY NOW. BUT SOME SAY HISTORY MOVES INCIRCLES AND THAT MAY BE VERY WELL ARGUED I HAVE ARGUED IT MYSELF. THEFACT IS HUMAN REASON MAY CARRY YOU A LITTLE TOO FAROVER THE HEDGE INFACT. IT CARRIED ME A GOOD WAY AT ONE TIME BUT I SAW IT WOULD NOT DO.I PULLED UP I PULLED UP IN TIME. BUT NOT TOO HARD. I HAVE ALWAYS BEENIN FAVOR OF A LITTLE THEORY WE MUST HAVE THOUGHT ELSE WE SHALL BELANDED BACK IN THE DARK AGES. BUT TALKING OF BOOKS THERE IS SOUTHEYSPENINSULAR WAR. I AM READING THAT OF A MORNING. YOU KNOW SOUTHEYNO SAID MR. CASAUBON NOT KEEPING PACE WITH MR. BROOKES IMPETUOUSREASON AND THINKING OF THE BOOK ONLY. I HAVE LITTLE LEISURE FOR SUCHLITERATURE JUST NOW. I HAVE BEEN USING UP MY EYESIGHT ON OLD CHARACTERSLATELY THE FACT IS I WANT A READER FOR MY EVENINGS BUT I AMFASTIDIOUS IN VOICES AND I CANNOT ENDURE LISTENING TO AN IMPERFECTREADER. IT IS A MISFORTUNE IN SOME SENSES I FEED TOO MUCH ON THEINWARD SOURCES I LIVE TOO MUCH WITH THE DEAD. MY MIND IS SOMETHINGLIKE THE GHOST OF AN ANCIENT WANDERING ABOUT THE WORLD AND TRYINGMENTALLY TO CONSTRUCT IT AS IT USED TO BE IN SPITE OF RUIN ANDCONFUSING CHANGES. BUT I FIND IT NECESSARY TO USE THE UTMOST CAUTIONABOUT MY EYESIGHT.THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT MR. CASAUBON HAD SPOKEN AT ANY LENGTH. HEDELIVERED HIMSELF WITH PRECISION AS IF HE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO MAKEA PUBLIC STATEMENT AND THE BALANCED SINGSONG NEATNESS OF HIS SPEECHOCCASIONALLY CORRESPONDED TO BY A MOVEMENT OF HIS HEAD WAS THE MORECONSPICUOUS FROM ITS CONTRAST WITH GOOD MR. BROOKES SCRAPPYSLOVENLINESS. DOROTHEA SAID TO HERSELF THAT MR. CASAUBON WAS THE MOSTINTERESTING MAN SHE HAD EVER SEEN NOT EXCEPTING EVEN MONSIEUR LIRETTHE VAUDOIS CLERGYMAN WHO HAD GIVEN CONFERENCES ON THE HISTORY OF THEWALDENSES. TO RECONSTRUCT A PAST WORLD DOUBTLESS WITH A VIEW TO THEHIGHEST PURPOSES OF TRUTHWHAT A WORK TO BE IN ANY WAY PRESENT AT TOASSIST IN THOUGH ONLY AS A LAMPHOLDER THIS ELEVATING THOUGHT LIFTEDHER ABOVE HER ANNOYANCE AT BEING TWITTED WITH HER IGNORANCE OFPOLITICAL ECONOMY THAT NEVEREXPLAINED SCIENCE WHICH WAS THRUST AS ANEXTINGUISHER OVER ALL HER LIGHTS.BUT YOU ARE FOND OF RIDING MISS BROOKE SIR JAMES PRESENTLY TOOK ANOPPORTUNITY OF SAYING. I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WOULD ENTER A LITTLEINTO THE PLEASURES OF HUNTING. I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME SEND OVER ACHESTNUT HORSE FOR YOU TO TRY. IT HAS BEEN TRAINED FOR A LADY. I SAWYOU ON SATURDAY CANTERING OVER THE HILL ON A NAG NOT WORTHY OF YOU. MYGROOM SHALL BRING CORYDON FOR YOU EVERY DAY IF YOU WILL ONLY MENTIONTHE TIME.THANK YOU YOU ARE VERY GOOD. I MEAN TO GIVE UP RIDING. I SHALL NOTRIDE ANY MORE SAID DOROTHEA URGED TO THIS BRUSQUE RESOLUTION BY ALITTLE ANNOYANCE THAT SIR JAMES WOULD BE SOLICITING HER ATTENTION WHENSHE WANTED TO GIVE IT ALL TO MR. CASAUBON.NO THAT IS TOO HARD SAID SIR JAMES IN A TONE OF REPROACH THATSHOWED STRONG INTEREST. YOUR SISTER IS GIVEN TO SELFMORTIFICATION ISSHE NOT HE CONTINUED TURNING TO CELIA WHO SAT AT HIS RIGHT HAND.I THINK SHE IS SAID CELIA FEELING AFRAID LEST SHE SHOULD SAYSOMETHING THAT WOULD NOT PLEASE HER SISTER AND BLUSHING AS PRETTILY ASPOSSIBLE ABOVE HER NECKLACE. SHE LIKES GIVING UP.IF THAT WERE TRUE CELIA MY GIVINGUP WOULD BE SELFINDULGENCE NOTSELFMORTIFICATION. BUT THERE MAY BE GOOD REASONS FOR CHOOSING NOT TODO WHAT IS VERY AGREEABLE SAID DOROTHEA.MR. BROOKE WAS SPEAKING AT THE SAME TIME BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MR.CASAUBON WAS OBSERVING DOROTHEA AND SHE WAS AWARE OF IT.EXACTLY SAID SIR JAMES. YOU GIVE UP FROM SOME HIGH GENEROUSMOTIVE.NO INDEED NOT EXACTLY. I DID NOT SAY THAT OF MYSELF ANSWEREDDOROTHEA REDDENING. UNLIKE CELIA SHE RARELY BLUSHED AND ONLY FROMHIGH DELIGHT OR ANGER. AT THIS MOMENT SHE FELT ANGRY WITH THE PERVERSESIR JAMES. WHY DID HE NOT PAY ATTENTION TO CELIA AND LEAVE HER TOLISTEN TO MR. CASAUBONIF THAT LEARNED MAN WOULD ONLY TALK INSTEAD OFALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE TALKED TO BY MR. BROOKE WHO WAS JUST THENINFORMING HIM THAT THE REFORMATION EITHER MEANT SOMETHING OR IT DIDNOT THAT HE HIMSELF WAS A PROTESTANT TO THE CORE BUT THAT CATHOLICISMWAS A FACT AND AS TO REFUSING AN ACRE OF YOUR GROUND FOR A ROMANISTCHAPEL ALL MEN NEEDED THE BRIDLE OF RELIGION WHICH PROPERLYSPEAKING WAS THE DREAD OF A HEREAFTER.I MADE A GREAT STUDY OF THEOLOGY AT ONE TIME SAID MR. BROOKE AS IFTO EXPLAIN THE INSIGHT JUST MANIFESTED. I KNOW SOMETHING OF ALLSCHOOLS. I KNEW WILBERFORCE IN HIS BEST DAYS. DO YOU KNOW WILBERFORCEMR. CASAUBON SAID NO.WELL WILBERFORCE WAS PERHAPS NOT ENOUGH OF A THINKER BUT IF I WENTINTO PARLIAMENT AS I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO DO I SHOULD SIT ON THEINDEPENDENT BENCH AS WILBERFORCE DID AND WORK AT PHILANTHROPY.MR. CASAUBON BOWED AND OBSERVED THAT IT WAS A WIDE FIELD.YES SAID MR. BROOKE WITH AN EASY SMILE BUT I HAVE DOCUMENTS. IBEGAN A LONG WHILE AGO TO COLLECT DOCUMENTS. THEY WANT ARRANGING BUTWHEN A QUESTION HAS STRUCK ME I HAVE WRITTEN TO SOMEBODY AND GOT ANANSWER. I HAVE DOCUMENTS AT MY BACK. BUT NOW HOW DO YOU ARRANGE YOURDOCUMENTSIN PIGEONHOLES PARTLY SAID MR. CASAUBON WITH RATHER A STARTLED AIROF EFFORT.AH PIGEONHOLES WILL NOT DO. I HAVE TRIED PIGEONHOLES BUTEVERYTHING GETS MIXED IN PIGEONHOLES I NEVER KNOW WHETHER A PAPER ISIN A OR Z.I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME SORT YOUR PAPERS FOR YOU UNCLE SAIDDOROTHEA. I WOULD LETTER THEM ALL AND THEN MAKE A LIST OF SUBJECTSUNDER EACH LETTER.MR. CASAUBON GRAVELY SMILED APPROVAL AND SAID TO MR. BROOKE YOU HAVEAN EXCELLENT SECRETARY AT HAND YOU PERCEIVE.NO NO SAID MR. BROOKE SHAKING HIS HEAD I CANNOT LET YOUNG LADIESMEDDLE WITH MY DOCUMENTS. YOUNG LADIES ARE TOO FLIGHTY.DOROTHEA FELT HURT. MR. CASAUBON WOULD THINK THAT HER UNCLE HAD SOMESPECIAL REASON FOR DELIVERING THIS OPINION WHEREAS THE REMARK LAY INHIS MIND AS LIGHTLY AS THE BROKEN WING OF AN INSECT AMONG ALL THE OTHERFRAGMENTS THERE AND A CHANCE CURRENT HAD SENT IT ALIGHTING ON HER.WHEN THE TWO GIRLS WERE IN THE DRAWINGROOM ALONE CELIA SAIDHOW VERY UGLY MR. CASAUBON ISCELIA HE IS ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHEDLOOKING MEN I EVER SAW. HEIS REMARKABLY LIKE THE PORTRAIT OF LOCKE. HE HAS THE SAME DEEPEYESOCKETS.HAD LOCKE THOSE TWO WHITE MOLES WITH HAIRS ON THEMOH I DARE SAY WHEN PEOPLE OF A CERTAIN SORT LOOKED AT HIM SAIDDOROTHEA WALKING AWAY A LITTLE.MR. CASAUBON IS SO SALLOW.ALL THE BETTER. I SUPPOSE YOU ADMIRE A MAN WITH THE COMPLEXION OF ACOCHON DE LAIT.DODO EXCLAIMED CELIA LOOKING AFTER HER IN SURPRISE. I NEVER HEARDYOU MAKE SUCH A COMPARISON BEFORE.WHY SHOULD I MAKE IT BEFORE THE OCCASION CAME IT IS A GOODCOMPARISON THE MATCH IS PERFECT.MISS BROOKE WAS CLEARLY FORGETTING HERSELF AND CELIA THOUGHT SO.I WONDER YOU SHOW TEMPER DOROTHEA.IT IS SO PAINFUL IN YOU CELIA THAT YOU WILL LOOK AT HUMAN BEINGS ASIF THEY WERE MERELY ANIMALS WITH A TOILET AND NEVER SEE THE GREAT SOULIN A MANS FACE.HAS MR. CASAUBON A GREAT SOUL CELIA WAS NOT WITHOUT A TOUCH OF NAIVEMALICE.YES I BELIEVE HE HAS SAID DOROTHEA WITH THE FULL VOICE OFDECISION. EVERYTHING I SEE IN HIM CORRESPONDS TO HIS PAMPHLET ONBIBLICAL COSMOLOGY.HE TALKS VERY LITTLE SAID CELIATHERE IS NO ONE FOR HIM TO TALK TO.CELIA THOUGHT PRIVATELY DOROTHEA QUITE DESPISES SIR JAMES CHETTAM IBELIEVE SHE WOULD NOT ACCEPT HIM. CELIA FELT THAT THIS WAS A PITY. SHEHAD NEVER BEEN DECEIVED AS TO THE OBJECT OF THE BARONETS INTEREST.SOMETIMES INDEED SHE HAD REFLECTED THAT DODO WOULD PERHAPS NOT MAKE AHUSBAND HAPPY WHO HAD NOT HER WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS AND STIFLED INTHE DEPTHS OF HER HEART WAS THE FEELING THAT HER SISTER WAS TOORELIGIOUS FOR FAMILY COMFORT. NOTIONS AND SCRUPLES WERE LIKE SPILTNEEDLES MAKING ONE AFRAID OF TREADING OR SITTING DOWN OR EVENEATING.WHEN MISS BROOKE WAS AT THE TEATABLE SIR JAMES CAME TO SIT DOWN BYHER NOT HAVING FELT HER MODE OF ANSWERING HIM AT ALL OFFENSIVE. WHYSHOULD HE HE THOUGHT IT PROBABLE THAT MISS BROOKE LIKED HIM ANDMANNERS MUST BE VERY MARKED INDEED BEFORE THEY CEASE TO BE INTERPRETEDBY PRECONCEPTIONS EITHER CONFIDENT OR DISTRUSTFUL. SHE WAS THOROUGHLYCHARMING TO HIM BUT OF COURSE HE THEORIZED A LITTLE ABOUT HISATTACHMENT. HE WAS MADE OF EXCELLENT HUMAN DOUGH AND HAD THE RAREMERIT OF KNOWING THAT HIS TALENTS EVEN IF LET LOOSE WOULD NOT SET THESMALLEST STREAM IN THE COUNTY ON FIRE HENCE HE LIKED THE PROSPECT OF AWIFE TO WHOM HE COULD SAY WHAT SHALL WE DO ABOUT THIS OR THAT WHOCOULD HELP HER HUSBAND OUT WITH REASONS AND WOULD ALSO HAVE THEPROPERTY QUALIFICATION FOR DOING SO. AS TO THE EXCESSIVE RELIGIOUSNESSALLEGED AGAINST MISS BROOKE HE HAD A VERY INDEFINITE NOTION OF WHAT ITCONSISTED IN AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD DIE OUT WITH MARRIAGE. INSHORT HE FELT HIMSELF TO BE IN LOVE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND WAS READYTO ENDURE A GREAT DEAL OF PREDOMINANCE WHICH AFTER ALL A MAN COULDALWAYS PUT DOWN WHEN HE LIKED. SIR JAMES HAD NO IDEA THAT HE SHOULDEVER LIKE TO PUT DOWN THE PREDOMINANCE OF THIS HANDSOME GIRL IN WHOSECLEVERNESS HE DELIGHTED. WHY NOT A MANS MINDWHAT THERE IS OF ITHASALWAYS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING MASCULINEAS THE SMALLEST BIRCHTREE ISOF A HIGHER KIND THAN THE MOST SOARING PALMAND EVEN HIS IGNORANCE ISOF A SOUNDER QUALITY. SIR JAMES MIGHT NOT HAVE ORIGINATED THISESTIMATE BUT A KIND PROVIDENCE FURNISHES THE LIMPEST PERSONALITY WITHA LITTLE GUM OR STARCH IN THE FORM OF TRADITION.LET ME HOPE THAT YOU WILL RESCIND THAT RESOLUTION ABOUT THE HORSEMISS BROOKE SAID THE PERSEVERING ADMIRER. I ASSURE YOU RIDING ISTHE MOST HEALTHY OF EXERCISES.I AM AWARE OF IT SAID DOROTHEA COLDLY. I THINK IT WOULD DO CELIAGOODIF SHE WOULD TAKE TO IT.BUT YOU ARE SUCH A PERFECT HORSEWOMAN.EXCUSE ME I HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE PRACTICE AND I SHOULD BE EASILYTHROWN.THEN THAT IS A REASON FOR MORE PRACTICE. EVERY LADY OUGHT TO BE APERFECT HORSEWOMAN THAT SHE MAY ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND.YOU SEE HOW WIDELY WE DIFFER SIR JAMES. I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND THAT IOUGHT NOT TO BE A PERFECT HORSEWOMAN AND SO I SHOULD NEVER CORRESPONDTO YOUR PATTERN OF A LADY. DOROTHEA LOOKED STRAIGHT BEFORE HER ANDSPOKE WITH COLD BRUSQUERIE VERY MUCH WITH THE AIR OF A HANDSOME BOYIN AMUSING CONTRAST WITH THE SOLICITOUS AMIABILITY OF HER ADMIRER.I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR REASONS FOR THIS CRUEL RESOLUTION. IT ISNOT POSSIBLE THAT YOU SHOULD THINK HORSEMANSHIP WRONG.IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD THINK IT WRONG FOR ME.OH WHY SAID SIR JAMES IN A TENDER TONE OF REMONSTRANCE.MR. CASAUBON HAD COME UP TO THE TABLE TEACUP IN HAND AND WASLISTENING.WE MUST NOT INQUIRE TOO CURIOUSLY INTO MOTIVES HE INTERPOSED IN HISMEASURED WAY. MISS BROOKE KNOWS THAT THEY ARE APT TO BECOME FEEBLE INTHE UTTERANCE THE AROMA IS MIXED WITH THE GROSSER AIR. WE MUST KEEPTHE GERMINATING GRAIN AWAY FROM THE LIGHT.DOROTHEA COLORED WITH PLEASURE AND LOOKED UP GRATEFULLY TO THESPEAKER. HERE WAS A MAN WHO COULD UNDERSTAND THE HIGHER INWARD LIFEAND WITH WHOM THERE COULD BE SOME SPIRITUAL COMMUNION NAY WHO COULDILLUMINATE PRINCIPLE WITH THE WIDEST KNOWLEDGE A MAN WHOSE LEARNINGALMOST AMOUNTED TO A PROOF OF WHATEVER HE BELIEVEDDOROTHEAS INFERENCES MAY SEEM LARGE BUT REALLY LIFE COULD NEVER HAVEGONE ON AT ANY PERIOD BUT FOR THIS LIBERAL ALLOWANCE OF CONCLUSIONSWHICH HAS FACILITATED MARRIAGE UNDER THE DIFFICULTIES OF CIVILIZATION.HAS ANY ONE EVER PINCHED INTO ITS PILULOUS SMALLNESS THE COBWEB OFPREMATRIMONIAL ACQUAINTANCESHIPCERTAINLY SAID GOOD SIR JAMES. MISS BROOKE SHALL NOT BE URGED TOTELL REASONS SHE WOULD RATHER BE SILENT UPON. I AM SURE HER REASONSWOULD DO HER HONOR.HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST JEALOUS OF THE INTEREST WITH WHICH DOROTHEA HADLOOKED UP AT MR. CASAUBON IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT A GIRL TO WHOMHE WAS MEDITATING AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE COULD CARE FOR A DRIED BOOKWORMTOWARDS FIFTY EXCEPT INDEED IN A RELIGIOUS SORT OF WAY AS FOR ACLERGYMAN OF SOME DISTINCTION.HOWEVER SINCE MISS BROOKE HAD BECOME ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION WITHMR. CASAUBON ABOUT THE VAUDOIS CLERGY SIR JAMES BETOOK HIMSELF TOCELIA AND TALKED TO HER ABOUT HER SISTER SPOKE OF A HOUSE IN TOWNAND ASKED WHETHER MISS BROOKE DISLIKED LONDON. AWAY FROM HER SISTERCELIA TALKED QUITE EASILY AND SIR JAMES SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THESECOND MISS BROOKE WAS CERTAINLY VERY AGREEABLE AS WELL AS PRETTYTHOUGH NOT AS SOME PEOPLE PRETENDED MORE CLEVER AND SENSIBLE THAN THEELDER SISTER. HE FELT THAT HE HAD CHOSEN THE ONE WHO WAS IN ALLRESPECTS THE SUPERIOR AND A MAN NATURALLY LIKES TO LOOK FORWARD TOHAVING THE BEST. HE WOULD BE THE VERY MAWWORM OF BACHELORS WHOPRETENDED NOT TO EXPECT IT.CHAPTER III.SAY GODDESS WHAT ENSUED WHEN RAPHAELTHE AFFABLE ARCHANGEL . . .                    EVETHE STORY HEARD ATTENTIVE AND WAS FILLEDWITH ADMIRATION AND DEEP MUSE TO HEAROF THINGS SO HIGH AND STRANGE.PARADISE LOST B. VII.IF IT HAD REALLY OCCURRED TO MR. CASAUBON TO THINK OF MISS BROOKE AS ASUITABLE WIFE FOR HIM THE REASONS THAT MIGHT INDUCE HER TO ACCEPT HIMWERE ALREADY PLANTED IN HER MIND AND BY THE EVENING OF THE NEXT DAYTHE REASONS HAD BUDDED AND BLOOMED. FOR THEY HAD HAD A LONGCONVERSATION IN THE MORNING WHILE CELIA WHO DID NOT LIKE THE COMPANYOF MR. CASAUBONS MOLES AND SALLOWNESS HAD ESCAPED TO THE VICARAGE TOPLAY WITH THE CURATES ILLSHOD BUT MERRY CHILDREN.DOROTHEA BY THIS TIME HAD LOOKED DEEP INTO THE UNGAUGED RESERVOIR OFMR. CASAUBONS MIND SEEING REFLECTED THERE IN VAGUE LABYRINTHINEEXTENSION EVERY QUALITY SHE HERSELF BROUGHT HAD OPENED MUCH OF HER OWNEXPERIENCE TO HIM AND HAD UNDERSTOOD FROM HIM THE SCOPE OF HIS GREATWORK ALSO OF ATTRACTIVELY LABYRINTHINE EXTENT. FOR HE HAD BEEN ASINSTRUCTIVE AS MILTONS AFFABLE ARCHANGEL AND WITH SOMETHING OF THEARCHANGELIC MANNER HE TOLD HER HOW HE HAD UNDERTAKEN TO SHOW WHATINDEED HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED BEFORE BUT NOT WITH THAT THOROUGHNESSJUSTICE OF COMPARISON AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ARRANGEMENT AT WHICH MR.CASAUBON AIMED THAT ALL THE MYTHICAL SYSTEMS OR ERRATIC MYTHICALFRAGMENTS IN THE WORLD WERE CORRUPTIONS OF A TRADITION ORIGINALLYREVEALED. HAVING ONCE MASTERED THE TRUE POSITION AND TAKEN A FIRMFOOTING THERE THE VAST FIELD OF MYTHICAL CONSTRUCTIONS BECAMEINTELLIGIBLE NAY LUMINOUS WITH THE REFLECTED LIGHT OFCORRESPONDENCES. BUT TO GATHER IN THIS GREAT HARVEST OF TRUTH WAS NOLIGHT OR SPEEDY WORK. HIS NOTES ALREADY MADE A FORMIDABLE RANGE OFVOLUMES BUT THE CROWNING TASK WOULD BE TO CONDENSE THESE VOLUMINOUSSTILLACCUMULATING RESULTS AND BRING THEM LIKE THE EARLIER VINTAGE OFHIPPOCRATIC BOOKS TO FIT A LITTLE SHELF. IN EXPLAINING THIS TODOROTHEA MR. CASAUBON EXPRESSED HIMSELF NEARLY AS HE WOULD HAVE DONETO A FELLOWSTUDENT FOR HE HAD NOT TWO STYLES OF TALKING AT COMMANDIT IS TRUE THAT WHEN HE USED A GREEK OR LATIN PHRASE HE ALWAYS GAVE THEENGLISH WITH SCRUPULOUS CARE BUT HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE DONE THIS INANY CASE. A LEARNED PROVINCIAL CLERGYMAN IS ACCUSTOMED TO THINK OF HISACQUAINTANCES AS OF LORDS KNYGHTES AND OTHER NOBLE AND WORTHI MENTHAT CONNE LATYN BUT LYTILLE.DOROTHEA WAS ALTOGETHER CAPTIVATED BY THE WIDE EMBRACE OF THISCONCEPTION. HERE WAS SOMETHING BEYOND THE SHALLOWS OF LADIES SCHOOLLITERATURE HERE WAS A LIVING BOSSUET WHOSE WORK WOULD RECONCILECOMPLETE KNOWLEDGE WITH DEVOTED PIETY HERE WAS A MODERN AUGUSTINE WHOUNITED THE GLORIES OF DOCTOR AND SAINT.THE SANCTITY SEEMED NO LESS CLEARLY MARKED THAN THE LEARNING FOR WHENDOROTHEA WAS IMPELLED TO OPEN HER MIND ON CERTAIN THEMES WHICH SHECOULD SPEAK OF TO NO ONE WHOM SHE HAD BEFORE SEEN AT TIPTON ESPECIALLYON THE SECONDARY IMPORTANCE OF ECCLESIASTICAL FORMS AND ARTICLES OFBELIEF COMPARED WITH THAT SPIRITUAL RELIGION THAT SUBMERGENCE OF SELFIN COMMUNION WITH DIVINE PERFECTION WHICH SEEMED TO HER TO BE EXPRESSEDIN THE BEST CHRISTIAN BOOKS OF WIDELY DISTANT AGES SHE FOUND IN MR.CASAUBON A LISTENER WHO UNDERSTOOD HER AT ONCE WHO COULD ASSURE HER OFHIS OWN AGREEMENT WITH THAT VIEW WHEN DULY TEMPERED WITH WISECONFORMITY AND COULD MENTION HISTORICAL EXAMPLES BEFORE UNKNOWN TOHER.HE THINKS WITH ME SAID DOROTHEA TO HERSELF OR RATHER HE THINKS AWHOLE WORLD OF WHICH MY THOUGHT IS BUT A POOR TWOPENNY MIRROR. AND HISFEELINGS TOO HIS WHOLE EXPERIENCEWHAT A LAKE COMPARED WITH MY LITTLEPOOLMISS BROOKE ARGUED FROM WORDS AND DISPOSITIONS NOT LESS UNHESITATINGLYTHAN OTHER YOUNG LADIES OF HER AGE. SIGNS ARE SMALL MEASURABLE THINGSBUT INTERPRETATIONS ARE ILLIMITABLE AND IN GIRLS OF SWEET ARDENTNATURE EVERY SIGN IS APT TO CONJURE UP WONDER HOPE BELIEF VAST AS ASKY AND COLORED BY A DIFFUSED THIMBLEFUL OF MATTER IN THE SHAPE OFKNOWLEDGE. THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS TOO GROSSLY DECEIVED FOR SINBAD HIMSELFMAY HAVE FALLEN BY GOODLUCK ON A TRUE DESCRIPTION AND WRONG REASONINGSOMETIMES LANDS POOR MORTALS IN RIGHT CONCLUSIONS STARTING A LONG WAYOFF THE TRUE POINT AND PROCEEDING BY LOOPS AND ZIGZAGS WE NOW ANDTHEN ARRIVE JUST WHERE WE OUGHT TO BE. BECAUSE MISS BROOKE WAS HASTY INHER TRUST IT IS NOT THEREFORE CLEAR THAT MR. CASAUBON WAS UNWORTHY OFIT.HE STAYED A LITTLE LONGER THAN HE HAD INTENDED ON A SLIGHT PRESSURE OFINVITATION FROM MR. BROOKE WHO OFFERED NO BAIT EXCEPT HIS OWNDOCUMENTS ON MACHINEBREAKING AND RICKBURNING. MR. CASAUBON WAS CALLEDINTO THE LIBRARY TO LOOK AT THESE IN A HEAP WHILE HIS HOST PICKED UPFIRST ONE AND THEN THE OTHER TO READ ALOUD FROM IN A SKIPPING ANDUNCERTAIN WAY PASSING FROM ONE UNFINISHED PASSAGE TO ANOTHER WITH AYES NOW BUT HERE AND FINALLY PUSHING THEM ALL ASIDE TO OPEN THEJOURNAL OF HIS YOUTHFUL CONTINENTAL TRAVELS.LOOK HEREHERE IS ALL ABOUT GREECE. RHAMNUS THE RUINS OF RHAMNUSYOUARE A GREAT GRECIAN NOW. I DONT KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE GIVEN MUCHSTUDY TO THE TOPOGRAPHY. I SPENT NO END OF TIME IN MAKING OUT THESETHINGSHELICON NOW. HERE NOWWE STARTED THE NEXT MORNING FORPARNASSUS THE DOUBLEPEAKED PARNASSUS. ALL THIS VOLUME IS ABOUTGREECE YOU KNOW MR. BROOKE WOUND UP RUBBING HIS THUMB TRANSVERSELYALONG THE EDGES OF THE LEAVES AS HE HELD THE BOOK FORWARD.MR. CASAUBON MADE A DIGNIFIED THOUGH SOMEWHAT SAD AUDIENCE BOWED INTHE RIGHT PLACE AND AVOIDED LOOKING AT ANYTHING DOCUMENTARY AS FAR ASPOSSIBLE WITHOUT SHOWING DISREGARD OR IMPATIENCE MINDFUL THAT THISDESULTORINESS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY ANDTHAT THE MAN WHO TOOK HIM ON THIS SEVERE MENTAL SCAMPER WAS NOT ONLY ANAMIABLE HOST BUT A LANDHOLDER AND CUSTOS ROTULORUM. WAS HIS ENDURANCEAIDED ALSO BY THE REFLECTION THAT MR. BROOKE WAS THE UNCLE OF DOROTHEACERTAINLY HE SEEMED MORE AND MORE BENT ON MAKING HER TALK TO HIM ONDRAWING HER OUT AS CELIA REMARKED TO HERSELF AND IN LOOKING AT HERHIS FACE WAS OFTEN LIT UP BY A SMILE LIKE PALE WINTRY SUNSHINE. BEFOREHE LEFT THE NEXT MORNING WHILE TAKING A PLEASANT WALK WITH MISS BROOKEALONG THE GRAVELLED TERRACE HE HAD MENTIONED TO HER THAT HE FELT THEDISADVANTAGE OF LONELINESS THE NEED OF THAT CHEERFUL COMPANIONSHIPWITH WHICH THE PRESENCE OF YOUTH CAN LIGHTEN OR VARY THE SERIOUS TOILSOF MATURITY. AND HE DELIVERED THIS STATEMENT WITH AS MUCH CAREFULPRECISION AS IF HE HAD BEEN A DIPLOMATIC ENVOY WHOSE WORDS WOULD BEATTENDED WITH RESULTS. INDEED MR. CASAUBON WAS NOT USED TO EXPECT THATHE SHOULD HAVE TO REPEAT OR REVISE HIS COMMUNICATIONS OF A PRACTICAL ORPERSONAL KIND. THE INCLINATIONS WHICH HE HAD DELIBERATELY STATED ON THED OF OCTOBER HE WOULD THINK IT ENOUGH TO REFER TO BY THE MENTION OFTHAT DATE JUDGING BY THE STANDARD OF HIS OWN MEMORY WHICH WAS AVOLUME WHERE A VIDE SUPRA COULD SERVE INSTEAD OF REPETITIONS AND NOTTHE ORDINARY LONGUSED BLOTTINGBOOK WHICH ONLY TELLS OF FORGOTTENWRITING. BUT IN THIS CASE MR. CASAUBONS CONFIDENCE WAS NOT LIKELY TOBE FALSIFIED FOR DOROTHEA HEARD AND RETAINED WHAT HE SAID WITH THEEAGER INTEREST OF A FRESH YOUNG NATURE TO WHICH EVERY VARIETY INEXPERIENCE IS AN EPOCH.IT WAS THREE OCLOCK IN THE BEAUTIFUL BREEZY AUTUMN DAY WHEN MR.CASAUBON DROVE OFF TO HIS RECTORY AT LOWICK ONLY FIVE MILES FROMTIPTON AND DOROTHEA WHO HAD ON HER BONNET AND SHAWL HURRIED ALONGTHE SHRUBBERY AND ACROSS THE PARK THAT SHE MIGHT WANDER THROUGH THEBORDERING WOOD WITH NO OTHER VISIBLE COMPANIONSHIP THAN THAT OF MONKTHE GREAT ST. BERNARD DOG WHO ALWAYS TOOK CARE OF THE YOUNG LADIES INTHEIR WALKS. THERE HAD RISEN BEFORE HER THE GIRLS VISION OF A POSSIBLEFUTURE FOR HERSELF TO WHICH SHE LOOKED FORWARD WITH TREMBLING HOPE ANDSHE WANTED TO WANDER ON IN THAT VISIONARY FUTURE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION.SHE WALKED BRISKLY IN THE BRISK AIR THE COLOR ROSE IN HER CHEEKS ANDHER STRAW BONNET WHICH OUR CONTEMPORARIES MIGHT LOOK AT WITHCONJECTURAL CURIOSITY AS AT AN OBSOLETE FORM OF BASKET FELL A LITTLEBACKWARD. SHE WOULD PERHAPS BE HARDLY CHARACTERIZED ENOUGH IF IT WEREOMITTED THAT SHE WORE HER BROWN HAIR FLATLY BRAIDED AND COILED BEHINDSO AS TO EXPOSE THE OUTLINE OF HER HEAD IN A DARING MANNER AT A TIMEWHEN PUBLIC FEELING REQUIRED THE MEAGRENESS OF NATURE TO BEDISSIMULATED BY TALL BARRICADES OF FRIZZED CURLS AND BOWS NEVERSURPASSED BY ANY GREAT RACE EXCEPT THE FEEJEEAN. THIS WAS A TRAIT OFMISS BROOKES ASCETICISM. BUT THERE WAS NOTHING OF AN ASCETICSEXPRESSION IN HER BRIGHT FULL EYES AS SHE LOOKED BEFORE HER NOTCONSCIOUSLY SEEING BUT ABSORBING INTO THE INTENSITY OF HER MOOD THESOLEMN GLORY OF THE AFTERNOON WITH ITS LONG SWATHES OF LIGHT BETWEENTHE FAROFF ROWS OF LIMES WHOSE SHADOWS TOUCHED EACH OTHER.ALL PEOPLE YOUNG OR OLD THAT IS ALL PEOPLE IN THOSE ANTEREFORMTIMES WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER AN INTERESTING OBJECT IF THEY HADREFERRED THE GLOW IN HER EYES AND CHEEKS TO THE NEWLY AWAKENED ORDINARYIMAGES OF YOUNG LOVE THE ILLUSIONS OF CHLOE ABOUT STREPHON HAVE BEENSUFFICIENTLY CONSECRATED IN POETRY AS THE PATHETIC LOVELINESS OF ALLSPONTANEOUS TRUST OUGHT TO BE. MISS PIPPIN ADORING YOUNG PUMPKIN ANDDREAMING ALONG ENDLESS VISTAS OF UNWEARYING COMPANIONSHIP WAS A LITTLEDRAMA WHICH NEVER TIRED OUR FATHERS AND MOTHERS AND HAD BEEN PUT INTOALL COSTUMES. LET BUT PUMPKIN HAVE A FIGURE WHICH WOULD SUSTAIN THEDISADVANTAGES OF THE SHORTWAISTED SWALLOWTAIL AND EVERYBODY FELT ITNOT ONLY NATURAL BUT NECESSARY TO THE PERFECTION OF WOMANHOOD THAT ASWEET GIRL SHOULD BE AT ONCE CONVINCED OF HIS VIRTUE HIS EXCEPTIONALABILITY AND ABOVE ALL HIS PERFECT SINCERITY. BUT PERHAPS NO PERSONSTHEN LIVINGCERTAINLY NONE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF TIPTONWOULD HAVE HADA SYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING FOR THE DREAMS OF A GIRL WHOSE NOTIONSABOUT MARRIAGE TOOK THEIR COLOR ENTIRELY FROM AN EXALTED ENTHUSIASMABOUT THE ENDS OF LIFE AN ENTHUSIASM WHICH WAS LIT CHIEFLY BY ITS OWNFIRE AND INCLUDED NEITHER THE NICETIES OF THE TROUSSEAU THE PATTERNOF PLATE NOR EVEN THE HONORS AND SWEET JOYS OF THE BLOOMING MATRON.IT HAD NOW ENTERED DOROTHEAS MIND THAT MR. CASAUBON MIGHT WISH TO MAKEHER HIS WIFE AND THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD DO SO TOUCHED HER WITH A SORTOF REVERENTIAL GRATITUDE. HOW GOOD OF HIMNAY IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS IFA WINGED MESSENGER HAD SUDDENLY STOOD BESIDE HER PATH AND HELD OUT HISHAND TOWARDS HER FOR A LONG WHILE SHE HAD BEEN OPPRESSED BY THEINDEFINITENESS WHICH HUNG IN HER MIND LIKE A THICK SUMMER HAZE OVERALL HER DESIRE TO MAKE HER LIFE GREATLY EFFECTIVE. WHAT COULD SHE DOWHAT OUGHT SHE TO DOSHE HARDLY MORE THAN A BUDDING WOMAN BUT YETWITH AN ACTIVE CONSCIENCE AND A GREAT MENTAL NEED NOT TO BE SATISFIEDBY A GIRLISH INSTRUCTION COMPARABLE TO THE NIBBLINGS AND JUDGMENTS OF ADISCURSIVE MOUSE. WITH SOME ENDOWMENT OF STUPIDITY AND CONCEIT SHEMIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT A CHRISTIAN YOUNG LADY OF FORTUNE SHOULD FINDHER IDEAL OF LIFE IN VILLAGE CHARITIES PATRONAGE OF THE HUMBLERCLERGY THE PERUSAL OF FEMALE SCRIPTURE CHARACTERS UNFOLDING THEPRIVATE EXPERIENCE OF SARA UNDER THE OLD DISPENSATION AND DORCAS UNDERTHE NEW AND THE CARE OF HER SOUL OVER HER EMBROIDERY IN HER OWNBOUDOIRWITH A BACKGROUND OF PROSPECTIVE MARRIAGE TO A MAN WHO IF LESSSTRICT THAN HERSELF AS BEING INVOLVED IN AFFAIRS RELIGIOUSLYINEXPLICABLE MIGHT BE PRAYED FOR AND SEASONABLY EXHORTED. FROM SUCHCONTENTMENT POOR DOROTHEA WAS SHUT OUT. THE INTENSITY OF HER RELIGIOUSDISPOSITION THE COERCION IT EXERCISED OVER HER LIFE WAS BUT ONEASPECT OF A NATURE ALTOGETHER ARDENT THEORETIC AND INTELLECTUALLYCONSEQUENT AND WITH SUCH A NATURE STRUGGLING IN THE BANDS OF A NARROWTEACHING HEMMED IN BY A SOCIAL LIFE WHICH SEEMED NOTHING BUT ALABYRINTH OF PETTY COURSES A WALLEDIN MAZE OF SMALL PATHS THAT LED NOWHITHER THE OUTCOME WAS SURE TO STRIKE OTHERS AS AT ONCE EXAGGERATIONAND INCONSISTENCY. THE THING WHICH SEEMED TO HER BEST SHE WANTED TOJUSTIFY BY THE COMPLETEST KNOWLEDGE AND NOT TO LIVE IN A PRETENDEDADMISSION OF RULES WHICH WERE NEVER ACTED ON. INTO THIS SOULHUNGER ASYET ALL HER YOUTHFUL PASSION WAS POURED THE UNION WHICH ATTRACTED HERWAS ONE THAT WOULD DELIVER HER FROM HER GIRLISH SUBJECTION TO HER OWNIGNORANCE AND GIVE HER THE FREEDOM OF VOLUNTARY SUBMISSION TO A GUIDEWHO WOULD TAKE HER ALONG THE GRANDEST PATH.I SHOULD LEARN EVERYTHING THEN SHE SAID TO HERSELF STILL WALKINGQUICKLY ALONG THE BRIDLE ROAD THROUGH THE WOOD. IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TOSTUDY THAT I MIGHT HELP HIM THE BETTER IN HIS GREAT WORKS. THERE WOULDBE NOTHING TRIVIAL ABOUT OUR LIVES. EVERYDAY THINGS WITH US WOULD MEANTHE GREATEST THINGS. IT WOULD BE LIKE MARRYING PASCAL. I SHOULD LEARNTO SEE THE TRUTH BY THE SAME LIGHT AS GREAT MEN HAVE SEEN IT BY. ANDTHEN I SHOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN I GOT OLDER I SHOULD SEE HOW ITWAS POSSIBLE TO LEAD A GRAND LIFE HERENOWIN ENGLAND. I DONT FEELSURE ABOUT DOING GOOD IN ANY WAY NOW EVERYTHING SEEMS LIKE GOING ON AMISSION TO A PEOPLE WHOSE LANGUAGE I DONT KNOWUNLESS IT WEREBUILDING GOOD COTTAGESTHERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. OH I HOPE ISHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THE PEOPLE WELL HOUSED IN LOWICK I WILL DRAWPLENTY OF PLANS WHILE I HAVE TIME.DOROTHEA CHECKED HERSELF SUDDENLY WITH SELFREBUKE FOR THE PRESUMPTUOUSWAY IN WHICH SHE WAS RECKONING ON UNCERTAIN EVENTS BUT SHE WAS SPAREDANY INWARD EFFORT TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF HER THOUGHTS BY THEAPPEARANCE OF A CANTERING HORSEMAN ROUND A TURNING OF THE ROAD. THEWELLGROOMED CHESTNUT HORSE AND TWO BEAUTIFUL SETTERS COULD LEAVE NODOUBT THAT THE RIDER WAS SIR JAMES CHETTAM. HE DISCERNED DOROTHEAJUMPED OFF HIS HORSE AT ONCE AND HAVING DELIVERED IT TO HIS GROOMADVANCED TOWARDS HER WITH SOMETHING WHITE ON HIS ARM AT WHICH THE TWOSETTERS WERE BARKING IN AN EXCITED MANNER.HOW DELIGHTFUL TO MEET YOU MISS BROOKE HE SAID RAISING HIS HAT ANDSHOWING HIS SLEEKLY WAVING BLOND HAIR. IT HAS HASTENED THE PLEASURE IWAS LOOKING FORWARD TO.MISS BROOKE WAS ANNOYED AT THE INTERRUPTION. THIS AMIABLE BARONETREALLY A SUITABLE HUSBAND FOR CELIA EXAGGERATED THE NECESSITY OFMAKING HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO THE ELDER SISTER. EVEN A PROSPECTIVEBROTHERINLAW MAY BE AN OPPRESSION IF HE WILL ALWAYS BE PRESUPPOSINGTOO GOOD AN UNDERSTANDING WITH YOU AND AGREEING WITH YOU EVEN WHEN YOUCONTRADICT HIM. THE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD MADE THE MISTAKE OF PAYING HISADDRESSES TO HERSELF COULD NOT TAKE SHAPE ALL HER MENTAL ACTIVITY WASUSED UP IN PERSUASIONS OF ANOTHER KIND. BUT HE WAS POSITIVELY OBTRUSIVEAT THIS MOMENT AND HIS DIMPLED HANDS WERE QUITE DISAGREEABLE. HERROUSED TEMPER MADE HER COLOR DEEPLY AS SHE RETURNED HIS GREETING WITHSOME HAUGHTINESS.SIR JAMES INTERPRETED THE HEIGHTENED COLOR IN THE WAY MOST GRATIFYINGTO HIMSELF AND THOUGHT HE NEVER SAW MISS BROOKE LOOKING SO HANDSOME.I HAVE BROUGHT A LITTLE PETITIONER HE SAID OR RATHER I HAVEBROUGHT HIM TO SEE IF HE WILL BE APPROVED BEFORE HIS PETITION ISOFFERED. HE SHOWED THE WHITE OBJECT UNDER HIS ARM WHICH WAS A TINYMALTESE PUPPY ONE OF NATURES MOST NAIVE TOYS.IT IS PAINFUL TO ME TO SEE THESE CREATURES THAT ARE BRED MERELY ASPETS SAID DOROTHEA WHOSE OPINION WAS FORMING ITSELF THAT VERY MOMENTAS OPINIONS WILL UNDER THE HEAT OF IRRITATION.OH WHY SAID SIR JAMES AS THEY WALKED FORWARD.I BELIEVE ALL THE PETTING THAT IS GIVEN THEM DOES NOT MAKE THEM HAPPY.THEY ARE TOO HELPLESS THEIR LIVES ARE TOO FRAIL. A WEASEL OR A MOUSETHAT GETS ITS OWN LIVING IS MORE INTERESTING. I LIKE TO THINK THAT THEANIMALS ABOUT US HAVE SOULS SOMETHING LIKE OUR OWN AND EITHER CARRY ONTHEIR OWN LITTLE AFFAIRS OR CAN BE COMPANIONS TO US LIKE MONK HERE.THOSE CREATURES ARE PARASITIC.I AM SO GLAD I KNOW THAT YOU DO NOT LIKE THEM SAID GOOD SIR JAMES.I SHOULD NEVER KEEP THEM FOR MYSELF BUT LADIES USUALLY ARE FOND OFTHESE MALTESE DOGS. HERE JOHN TAKE THIS DOG WILL YOUTHE OBJECTIONABLE PUPPY WHOSE NOSE AND EYES WERE EQUALLY BLACK ANDEXPRESSIVE WAS THUS GOT RID OF SINCE MISS BROOKE DECIDED THAT IT HADBETTER NOT HAVE BEEN BORN. BUT SHE FELT IT NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN.YOU MUST NOT JUDGE OF CELIAS FEELING FROM MINE. I THINK SHE LIKESTHESE SMALL PETS. SHE HAD A TINY TERRIER ONCE WHICH SHE WAS VERY FONDOF. IT MADE ME UNHAPPY BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID OF TREADING ON IT. I AMRATHER SHORTSIGHTED.YOU HAVE YOUR OWN OPINION ABOUT EVERYTHING MISS BROOKE AND IT ISALWAYS A GOOD OPINION.WHAT ANSWER WAS POSSIBLE TO SUCH STUPID COMPLIMENTINGDO YOU KNOW I ENVY YOU THAT SIR JAMES SAID AS THEY CONTINUEDWALKING AT THE RATHER BRISK PACE SET BY DOROTHEA.I DONT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN.YOUR POWER OF FORMING AN OPINION. I CAN FORM AN OPINION OF PERSONS. IKNOW WHEN I LIKE PEOPLE. BUT ABOUT OTHER MATTERS DO YOU KNOW I HAVEOFTEN A DIFFICULTY IN DECIDING. ONE HEARS VERY SENSIBLE THINGS SAID ONOPPOSITE SIDES.OR THAT SEEM SENSIBLE. PERHAPS WE DONT ALWAYS DISCRIMINATE BETWEENSENSE AND NONSENSE.DOROTHEA FELT THAT SHE WAS RATHER RUDE.EXACTLY SAID SIR JAMES. BUT YOU SEEM TO HAVE THE POWER OFDISCRIMINATION.ON THE CONTRARY I AM OFTEN UNABLE TO DECIDE. BUT THAT IS FROMIGNORANCE. THE RIGHT CONCLUSION IS THERE ALL THE SAME THOUGH I AMUNABLE TO SEE IT.I THINK THERE ARE FEW WHO WOULD SEE IT MORE READILY. DO YOU KNOWLOVEGOOD WAS TELLING ME YESTERDAY THAT YOU HAD THE BEST NOTION IN THEWORLD OF A PLAN FOR COTTAGESQUITE WONDERFUL FOR A YOUNG LADY HETHOUGHT. YOU HAD A REAL GENUS TO USE HIS EXPRESSION. HE SAID YOUWANTED MR. BROOKE TO BUILD A NEW SET OF COTTAGES BUT HE SEEMED TOTHINK IT HARDLY PROBABLE THAT YOUR UNCLE WOULD CONSENT. DO YOU KNOWTHAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS I WISH TO DOI MEAN ON MY OWN ESTATE. ISHOULD BE SO GLAD TO CARRY OUT THAT PLAN OF YOURS IF YOU WOULD LET MESEE IT. OF COURSE IT IS SINKING MONEY THAT IS WHY PEOPLE OBJECT TOIT. LABORERS CAN NEVER PAY RENT TO MAKE IT ANSWER. BUT AFTER ALL ITIS WORTH DOING.WORTH DOING YES INDEED SAID DOROTHEA ENERGETICALLY FORGETTINGHER PREVIOUS SMALL VEXATIONS. I THINK WE DESERVE TO BE BEATEN OUT OFOUR BEAUTIFUL HOUSES WITH A SCOURGE OF SMALL CORDSALL OF US WHO LETTENANTS LIVE IN SUCH STIES AS WE SEE ROUND US. LIFE IN COTTAGES MIGHTBE HAPPIER THAN OURS IF THEY WERE REAL HOUSES FIT FOR HUMAN BEINGSFROM WHOM WE EXPECT DUTIES AND AFFECTIONS.WILL YOU SHOW ME YOUR PLANYES CERTAINLY. I DARE SAY IT IS VERY FAULTY. BUT I HAVE BEENEXAMINING ALL THE PLANS FOR COTTAGES IN LOUDONS BOOK AND PICKED OUTWHAT SEEM THE BEST THINGS. OH WHAT A HAPPINESS IT WOULD BE TO SET THEPATTERN ABOUT HERE I THINK INSTEAD OF LAZARUS AT THE GATE WE SHOULDPUT THE PIGSTY COTTAGES OUTSIDE THE PARKGATE.DOROTHEA WAS IN THE BEST TEMPER NOW. SIR JAMES AS BROTHER INLAWBUILDING MODEL COTTAGES ON HIS ESTATE AND THEN PERHAPS OTHERS BEINGBUILT AT LOWICK AND MORE AND MORE ELSEWHERE IN IMITATIONIT WOULD BEAS IF THE SPIRIT OF OBERLIN HAD PASSED OVER THE PARISHES TO MAKE THELIFE OF POVERTY BEAUTIFULSIR JAMES SAW ALL THE PLANS AND TOOK ONE AWAY TO CONSULT UPON WITHLOVEGOOD. HE ALSO TOOK AWAY A COMPLACENT SENSE THAT HE WAS MAKING GREATPROGRESS IN MISS BROOKES GOOD OPINION. THE MALTESE PUPPY WAS NOTOFFERED TO CELIA AN OMISSION WHICH DOROTHEA AFTERWARDS THOUGHT OF WITHSURPRISE BUT SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR IT. SHE HAD BEEN ENGROSSING SIRJAMES. AFTER ALL IT WAS A RELIEF THAT THERE WAS NO PUPPY TO TREADUPON.CELIA WAS PRESENT WHILE THE PLANS WERE BEING EXAMINED AND OBSERVED SIRJAMESS ILLUSION. HE THINKS THAT DODO CARES ABOUT HIM AND SHE ONLYCARES ABOUT HER PLANS. YET I AM NOT CERTAIN THAT SHE WOULD REFUSE HIMIF SHE THOUGHT HE WOULD LET HER MANAGE EVERYTHING AND CARRY OUT ALL HERNOTIONS. AND HOW VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SIR JAMES WOULD BE I CANNOT BEARNOTIONS.IT WAS CELIAS PRIVATE LUXURY TO INDULGE IN THIS DISLIKE. SHE DARED NOTCONFESS IT TO HER SISTER IN ANY DIRECT STATEMENT FOR THAT WOULD BELAYING HERSELF OPEN TO A DEMONSTRATION THAT SHE WAS SOMEHOW OR OTHER ATWAR WITH ALL GOODNESS. BUT ON SAFE OPPORTUNITIES SHE HAD AN INDIRECTMODE OF MAKING HER NEGATIVE WISDOM TELL UPON DOROTHEA AND CALLING HERDOWN FROM HER RHAPSODIC MOOD BY REMINDING HER THAT PEOPLE WERE STARINGNOT LISTENING. CELIA WAS NOT IMPULSIVE WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY COULD WAITAND CAME FROM HER ALWAYS WITH THE SAME QUIET STACCATO EVENNESS. WHENPEOPLE TALKED WITH ENERGY AND EMPHASIS SHE WATCHED THEIR FACES ANDFEATURES MERELY. SHE NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND HOW WELLBRED PERSONSCONSENTED TO SING AND OPEN THEIR MOUTHS IN THE RIDICULOUS MANNERREQUISITE FOR THAT VOCAL EXERCISE.IT WAS NOT MANY DAYS BEFORE MR. CASAUBON PAID A MORNING VISIT ON WHICHHE WAS INVITED AGAIN FOR THE FOLLOWING WEEK TO DINE AND STAY THE NIGHT.THUS DOROTHEA HAD THREE MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM AND WAS CONVINCEDTHAT HER FIRST IMPRESSIONS HAD BEEN JUST. HE WAS ALL SHE HAD AT FIRSTIMAGINED HIM TO BE ALMOST EVERYTHING HE HAD SAID SEEMED LIKE ASPECIMEN FROM A MINE OR THE INSCRIPTION ON THE DOOR OF A MUSEUM WHICHMIGHT OPEN ON THE TREASURES OF PAST AGES AND THIS TRUST IN HIS MENTALWEALTH WAS ALL THE DEEPER AND MORE EFFECTIVE ON HER INCLINATION BECAUSEIT WAS NOW OBVIOUS THAT HIS VISITS WERE MADE FOR HER SAKE. THISACCOMPLISHED MAN CONDESCENDED TO THINK OF A YOUNG GIRL AND TAKE THEPAINS TO TALK TO HER NOT WITH ABSURD COMPLIMENT BUT WITH AN APPEAL TOHER UNDERSTANDING AND SOMETIMES WITH INSTRUCTIVE CORRECTION. WHATDELIGHTFUL COMPANIONSHIP MR. CASAUBON SEEMED EVEN UNCONSCIOUS THATTRIVIALITIES EXISTED AND NEVER HANDED ROUND THAT SMALLTALK OF HEAVYMEN WHICH IS AS ACCEPTABLE AS STALE BRIDECAKE BROUGHT FORTH WITH ANODOR OF CUPBOARD. HE TALKED OF WHAT HE WAS INTERESTED IN OR ELSE HEWAS SILENT AND BOWED WITH SAD CIVILITY. TO DOROTHEA THIS WAS ADORABLEGENUINENESS AND RELIGIOUS ABSTINENCE FROM THAT ARTIFICIALITY WHICHUSES UP THE SOUL IN THE EFFORTS OF PRETENCE. FOR SHE LOOKED ASREVERENTLY AT MR. CASAUBONS RELIGIOUS ELEVATION ABOVE HERSELF AS SHEDID AT HIS INTELLECT AND LEARNING. HE ASSENTED TO HER EXPRESSIONS OFDEVOUT FEELING AND USUALLY WITH AN APPROPRIATE QUOTATION HE ALLOWEDHIMSELF TO SAY THAT HE HAD GONE THROUGH SOME SPIRITUAL CONFLICTS IN HISYOUTH IN SHORT DOROTHEA SAW THAT HERE SHE MIGHT RECKON ONUNDERSTANDING SYMPATHY AND GUIDANCE. ON ONEONLY ONEOF HER FAVORITETHEMES SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED. MR. CASAUBON APPARENTLY DID NOT CARE ABOUTBUILDING COTTAGES AND DIVERTED THE TALK TO THE EXTREMELY NARROWACCOMMODATION WHICH WAS TO BE HAD IN THE DWELLINGS OF THE ANCIENTEGYPTIANS AS IF TO CHECK A TOO HIGH STANDARD. AFTER HE WAS GONEDOROTHEA DWELT WITH SOME AGITATION ON THIS INDIFFERENCE OF HIS AND HERMIND WAS MUCH EXERCISED WITH ARGUMENTS DRAWN FROM THE VARYINGCONDITIONS OF CLIMATE WHICH MODIFY HUMAN NEEDS AND FROM THE ADMITTEDWICKEDNESS OF PAGAN DESPOTS. SHOULD SHE NOT URGE THESE ARGUMENTS ON MR.CASAUBON WHEN HE CAME AGAIN BUT FURTHER REFLECTION TOLD HER THAT SHEWAS PRESUMPTUOUS IN DEMANDING HIS ATTENTION TO SUCH A SUBJECT HE WOULDNOT DISAPPROVE OF HER OCCUPYING HERSELF WITH IT IN LEISURE MOMENTS ASOTHER WOMEN EXPECTED TO OCCUPY THEMSELVES WITH THEIR DRESS ANDEMBROIDERYWOULD NOT FORBID IT WHENDOROTHEA FELT RATHER ASHAMED AS SHEDETECTED HERSELF IN THESE SPECULATIONS. BUT HER UNCLE HAD BEEN INVITEDTO GO TO LOWICK TO STAY A COUPLE OF DAYS WAS IT REASONABLE TO SUPPOSETHAT MR. CASAUBON DELIGHTED IN MR. BROOKES SOCIETY FOR ITS OWN SAKEEITHER WITH OR WITHOUT DOCUMENTSMEANWHILE THAT LITTLE DISAPPOINTMENT MADE HER DELIGHT THE MORE IN SIRJAMES CHETTAMS READINESS TO SET ON FOOT THE DESIRED IMPROVEMENTS. HECAME MUCH OFTENER THAN MR. CASAUBON AND DOROTHEA CEASED TO FIND HIMDISAGREEABLE SINCE HE SHOWED HIMSELF SO ENTIRELY IN EARNEST FOR HE HADALREADY ENTERED WITH MUCH PRACTICAL ABILITY INTO LOVEGOODS ESTIMATESAND WAS CHARMINGLY DOCILE. SHE PROPOSED TO BUILD A COUPLE OF COTTAGESAND TRANSFER TWO FAMILIES FROM THEIR OLD CABINS WHICH COULD THEN BEPULLED DOWN SO THAT NEW ONES COULD BE BUILT ON THE OLD SITES. SIRJAMES SAID EXACTLY AND SHE BORE THE WORD REMARKABLY WELL.CERTAINLY THESE MEN WHO HAD SO FEW SPONTANEOUS IDEAS MIGHT BE VERYUSEFUL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY UNDER GOOD FEMININE DIRECTION IF THEY WEREFORTUNATE IN CHOOSING THEIR SISTERSINLAW IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAYWHETHER THERE WAS OR WAS NOT A LITTLE WILFULNESS IN HER CONTINUINGBLIND TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANOTHER SORT OF CHOICE WAS IN QUESTION INRELATION TO HER. BUT HER LIFE WAS JUST NOW FULL OF HOPE AND ACTION SHEWAS NOT ONLY THINKING OF HER PLANS BUT GETTING DOWN LEARNED BOOKS FROMTHE LIBRARY AND READING MANY THINGS HASTILY THAT SHE MIGHT BE A LITTLELESS IGNORANT IN TALKING TO MR. CASAUBON ALL THE WHILE BEING VISITEDWITH CONSCIENTIOUS QUESTIONINGS WHETHER SHE WERE NOT EXALTING THESEPOOR DOINGS ABOVE MEASURE AND CONTEMPLATING THEM WITH THATSELFSATISFACTION WHICH WAS THE LAST DOOM OF IGNORANCE AND FOLLY.CHAPTER IV.ST GENT. OUR DEEDS ARE FETTERS THAT WE FORGE OURSELVES.D GENT. AY TRULY BUT I THINK IT IS THE WORLDTHAT BRINGS THE IRON.SIR JAMES SEEMS DETERMINED TO DO EVERYTHING YOU WISH SAID CELIA ASTHEY WERE DRIVING HOME FROM AN INSPECTION OF THE NEW BUILDINGSITE.HE IS A GOOD CREATURE AND MORE SENSIBLE THAN ANY ONE WOULD IMAGINESAID DOROTHEA INCONSIDERATELY.YOU MEAN THAT HE APPEARS SILLY.NO NO SAID DOROTHEA RECOLLECTING HERSELF AND LAYING HER HAND ONHER SISTERS A MOMENT BUT HE DOES NOT TALK EQUALLY WELL ON ALLSUBJECTS.I SHOULD THINK NONE BUT DISAGREEABLE PEOPLE DO SAID CELIA IN HERUSUAL PURRING WAY. THEY MUST BE VERY DREADFUL TO LIVE WITH. ONLYTHINK AT BREAKFAST AND ALWAYS.DOROTHEA LAUGHED. O KITTY YOU ARE A WONDERFUL CREATURE SHE PINCHEDCELIAS CHIN BEING IN THE MOOD NOW TO THINK HER VERY WINNING ANDLOVELYFIT HEREAFTER TO BE AN ETERNAL CHERUB AND IF IT WERE NOTDOCTRINALLY WRONG TO SAY SO HARDLY MORE IN NEED OF SALVATION THAN ASQUIRREL. OF COURSE PEOPLE NEED NOT BE ALWAYS TALKING WELL. ONLY ONETELLS THE QUALITY OF THEIR MINDS WHEN THEY TRY TO TALK WELL.YOU MEAN THAT SIR JAMES TRIES AND FAILS.I WAS SPEAKING GENERALLY. WHY DO YOU CATECHISE ME ABOUT SIR JAMES ITIS NOT THE OBJECT OF HIS LIFE TO PLEASE ME.NOW DODO CAN YOU REALLY BELIEVE THATCERTAINLY. HE THINKS OF ME AS A FUTURE SISTERTHAT IS ALL. DOROTHEAHAD NEVER HINTED THIS BEFORE WAITING FROM A CERTAIN SHYNESS ON SUCHSUBJECTS WHICH WAS MUTUAL BETWEEN THE SISTERS UNTIL IT SHOULD BEINTRODUCED BY SOME DECISIVE EVENT. CELIA BLUSHED BUT SAID AT ONCEPRAY DO NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE ANY LONGER DODO. WHEN TANTRIPP WASBRUSHING MY HAIR THE OTHER DAY SHE SAID THAT SIR JAMESS MAN KNEW FROMMRS. CADWALLADERS MAID THAT SIR JAMES WAS TO MARRY THE ELDEST MISSBROOKE.HOW CAN YOU LET TANTRIPP TALK SUCH GOSSIP TO YOU CELIA SAIDDOROTHEA INDIGNANTLY NOT THE LESS ANGRY BECAUSE DETAILS ASLEEP IN HERMEMORY WERE NOW AWAKENED TO CONFIRM THE UNWELCOME REVELATION. YOU MUSTHAVE ASKED HER QUESTIONS. IT IS DEGRADING.I SEE NO HARM AT ALL IN TANTRIPPS TALKING TO ME. IT IS BETTER TO HEARWHAT PEOPLE SAY. YOU SEE WHAT MISTAKES YOU MAKE BY TAKING UP NOTIONS. IAM QUITE SURE THAT SIR JAMES MEANS TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER AND HEBELIEVES THAT YOU WILL ACCEPT HIM ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN SOPLEASED WITH HIM ABOUT THE PLANS. AND UNCLE TOOI KNOW HE EXPECTS IT.EVERY ONE CAN SEE THAT SIR JAMES IS VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH YOU.THE REVULSION WAS SO STRONG AND PAINFUL IN DOROTHEAS MIND THAT THETEARS WELLED UP AND FLOWED ABUNDANTLY. ALL HER DEAR PLANS WEREEMBITTERED AND SHE THOUGHT WITH DISGUST OF SIR JAMESS CONCEIVING THATSHE RECOGNIZED HIM AS HER LOVER. THERE WAS VEXATION TOO ON ACCOUNT OFCELIA.HOW COULD HE EXPECT IT SHE BURST FORTH IN HER MOST IMPETUOUS MANNER.I HAVE NEVER AGREED WITH HIM ABOUT ANYTHING BUT THE COTTAGES I WASBARELY POLITE TO HIM BEFORE.BUT YOU HAVE BEEN SO PLEASED WITH HIM SINCE THEN HE HAS BEGUN TO FEELQUITE SURE THAT YOU ARE FOND OF HIM.FOND OF HIM CELIA HOW CAN YOU CHOOSE SUCH ODIOUS EXPRESSIONS SAIDDOROTHEA PASSIONATELY.DEAR ME DOROTHEA I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE RIGHT FOR YOU TO BE FOND OF AMAN WHOM YOU ACCEPTED FOR A HUSBAND.IT IS OFFENSIVE TO ME TO SAY THAT SIR JAMES COULD THINK I WAS FOND OFHIM. BESIDES IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD FOR THE FEELING I MUST HAVETOWARDS THE MAN I WOULD ACCEPT AS A HUSBAND.WELL I AM SORRY FOR SIR JAMES. I THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO TELL YOUBECAUSE YOU WENT ON AS YOU ALWAYS DO NEVER LOOKING JUST WHERE YOU AREAND TREADING IN THE WRONG PLACE. YOU ALWAYS SEE WHAT NOBODY ELSE SEESIT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SATISFY YOU YET YOU NEVER SEE WHAT IS QUITE PLAIN.THATS YOUR WAY DODO. SOMETHING CERTAINLY GAVE CELIA UNUSUAL COURAGEAND SHE WAS NOT SPARING THE SISTER OF WHOM SHE WAS OCCASIONALLY IN AWE.WHO CAN TELL WHAT JUST CRITICISMS MURR THE CAT MAY BE PASSING ON USBEINGS OF WIDER SPECULATIONIT IS VERY PAINFUL SAID DOROTHEA FEELING SCOURGED. I CAN HAVE NOMORE TO DO WITH THE COTTAGES. I MUST BE UNCIVIL TO HIM. I MUST TELL HIMI WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM. IT IS VERY PAINFUL. HER EYESFILLED AGAIN WITH TEARS.WAIT A LITTLE. THINK ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW HE IS GOING AWAY FOR A DAY ORTWO TO SEE HIS SISTER. THERE WILL BE NOBODY BESIDES LOVEGOOD. CELIACOULD NOT HELP RELENTING. POOR DODO SHE WENT ON IN AN AMIABLESTACCATO. IT IS VERY HARD IT IS YOUR FAVORITE FAD TO DRAW PLANS.FAD TO DRAW PLANS DO YOU THINK I ONLY CARE ABOUT MYFELLOWCREATURES HOUSES IN THAT CHILDISH WAY I MAY WELL MAKEMISTAKES. HOW CAN ONE EVER DO ANYTHING NOBLY CHRISTIAN LIVING AMONGPEOPLE WITH SUCH PETTY THOUGHTSNO MORE WAS SAID DOROTHEA WAS TOO MUCH JARRED TO RECOVER HER TEMPERAND BEHAVE SO AS TO SHOW THAT SHE ADMITTED ANY ERROR IN HERSELF. SHEWAS DISPOSED RATHER TO ACCUSE THE INTOLERABLE NARROWNESS AND THEPURBLIND CONSCIENCE OF THE SOCIETY AROUND HER AND CELIA WAS NO LONGERTHE ETERNAL CHERUB BUT A THORN IN HER SPIRIT A PINKANDWHITENULLIFIDIAN WORSE THAN ANY DISCOURAGING PRESENCE IN THE PILGRIMSPROGRESS. THE FAD OF DRAWING PLANS WHAT WAS LIFE WORTHWHAT GREATFAITH WAS POSSIBLE WHEN THE WHOLE EFFECT OF ONES ACTIONS COULD BEWITHERED UP INTO SUCH PARCHED RUBBISH AS THAT WHEN SHE GOT OUT OF THECARRIAGE HER CHEEKS WERE PALE AND HER EYELIDS RED. SHE WAS AN IMAGE OFSORROW AND HER UNCLE WHO MET HER IN THE HALL WOULD HAVE BEEN ALARMEDIF CELIA HAD NOT BEEN CLOSE TO HER LOOKING SO PRETTY AND COMPOSED THATHE AT ONCE CONCLUDED DOROTHEAS TEARS TO HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN HEREXCESSIVE RELIGIOUSNESS. HE HAD RETURNED DURING THEIR ABSENCE FROM AJOURNEY TO THE COUNTY TOWN ABOUT A PETITION FOR THE PARDON OF SOMECRIMINAL.WELL MY DEARS HE SAID KINDLY AS THEY WENT UP TO KISS HIM I HOPENOTHING DISAGREEABLE HAS HAPPENED WHILE I HAVE BEEN AWAY.NO UNCLE SAID CELIA WE HAVE BEEN TO FRESHITT TO LOOK AT THECOTTAGES. WE THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN AT HOME TO LUNCH.I CAME BY LOWICK TO LUNCHYOU DIDNT KNOW I CAME BY LOWICK. AND I HAVEBROUGHT A COUPLE OF PAMPHLETS FOR YOU DOROTHEAIN THE LIBRARY YOUKNOW THEY LIE ON THE TABLE IN THE LIBRARY.IT SEEMED AS IF AN ELECTRIC STREAM WENT THROUGH DOROTHEA THRILLING HERFROM DESPAIR INTO EXPECTATION. THEY WERE PAMPHLETS ABOUT THE EARLYCHURCH. THE OPPRESSION OF CELIA TANTRIPP AND SIR JAMES WAS SHAKENOFF AND SHE WALKED STRAIGHT TO THE LIBRARY. CELIA WENT UPSTAIRS. MR.BROOKE WAS DETAINED BY A MESSAGE BUT WHEN HE REENTERED THE LIBRARYHE FOUND DOROTHEA SEATED AND ALREADY DEEP IN ONE OF THE PAMPHLETS WHICHHAD SOME MARGINAL MANUSCRIPT OF MR. CASAUBONSTAKING IT IN AS EAGERLYAS SHE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN IN THE SCENT OF A FRESH BOUQUET AFTER A DRYHOT DREARY WALK.SHE WAS GETTING AWAY FROM TIPTON AND FRESHITT AND HER OWN SADLIABILITY TO TREAD IN THE WRONG PLACES ON HER WAY TO THE NEW JERUSALEM.MR. BROOKE SAT DOWN IN HIS ARMCHAIR STRETCHED HIS LEGS TOWARDS THEWOODFIRE WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO A WONDROUS MASS OF GLOWING DICEBETWEEN THE DOGS AND RUBBED HIS HANDS GENTLY LOOKING VERY MILDLYTOWARDS DOROTHEA BUT WITH A NEUTRAL LEISURELY AIR AS IF HE HADNOTHING PARTICULAR TO SAY. DOROTHEA CLOSED HER PAMPHLET AS SOON AS SHEWAS AWARE OF HER UNCLES PRESENCE AND ROSE AS IF TO GO. USUALLY SHEWOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTED ABOUT HER UNCLES MERCIFUL ERRAND ON BEHALFOF THE CRIMINAL BUT HER LATE AGITATION HAD MADE HER ABSENTMINDED.I CAME BACK BY LOWICK YOU KNOW SAID MR. BROOKE NOT AS IF WITH ANYINTENTION TO ARREST HER DEPARTURE BUT APPARENTLY FROM HIS USUALTENDENCY TO SAY WHAT HE HAD SAID BEFORE. THIS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OFHUMAN SPEECH WAS MARKEDLY EXHIBITED IN MR. BROOKE. I LUNCHED THERE ANDSAW CASAUBONS LIBRARY AND THAT KIND OF THING. THERES A SHARP AIRDRIVING. WONT YOU SIT DOWN MY DEAR YOU LOOK COLD.DOROTHEA FELT QUITE INCLINED TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION. SOME TIMES WHENHER UNCLES EASY WAY OF TAKING THINGS DID NOT HAPPEN TO BEEXASPERATING IT WAS RATHER SOOTHING. SHE THREW OFF HER MANTLE ANDBONNET AND SAT DOWN OPPOSITE TO HIM ENJOYING THE GLOW BUT LIFTING UPHER BEAUTIFUL HANDS FOR A SCREEN. THEY WERE NOT THIN HANDS OR SMALLHANDS BUT POWERFUL FEMININE MATERNAL HANDS. SHE SEEMED TO BE HOLDINGTHEM UP IN PROPITIATION FOR HER PASSIONATE DESIRE TO KNOW AND TO THINKWHICH IN THE UNFRIENDLY MEDIUMS OF TIPTON AND FRESHITT HAD ISSUED INCRYING AND RED EYELIDS.SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF NOW OF THE CONDEMNED CRIMINAL. WHAT NEWS HAVEYOU BROUGHT ABOUT THE SHEEPSTEALER UNCLEWHAT POOR BUNCHWELL IT SEEMS WE CANT GET HIM OFFHE IS TO BEHANGED.DOROTHEAS BROW TOOK AN EXPRESSION OF REPROBATION AND PITY.HANGED YOU KNOW SAID MR. BROOKE WITH A QUIET NOD. POOR ROMILLYHE WOULD HAVE HELPED US. I KNEW ROMILLY. CASAUBON DIDNT KNOW ROMILLY.HE IS A LITTLE BURIED IN BOOKS YOU KNOW CASAUBON IS.WHEN A MAN HAS GREAT STUDIES AND IS WRITING A GREAT WORK HE MUST OFCOURSE GIVE UP SEEING MUCH OF THE WORLD. HOW CAN HE GO ABOUT MAKINGACQUAINTANCESTHATS TRUE. BUT A MAN MOPES YOU KNOW. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A BACHELORTOO BUT I HAVE THAT SORT OF DISPOSITION THAT I NEVER MOPED IT WAS MYWAY TO GO ABOUT EVERYWHERE AND TAKE IN EVERYTHING.

HOWEVER THE LONG AND THESHORT OF IT IS THAT HE HAS ASKED MY PERMISSION TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER OFMARRIAGEOF MARRIAGE YOU KNOW SAID MR. BROOKE WITH HIS EXPLANATORYNOD. I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO TELL YOU MY DEAR.NO ONE COULD HAVE DETECTED ANY ANXIETY IN MR. BROOKES MANNER BUT HEDID REALLY WISH TO KNOW SOMETHING OF HIS NIECES MIND THAT IF THEREWERE ANY NEED FOR ADVICE HE MIGHT GIVE IT IN TIME. WHAT FEELING HE ASA MAGISTRATE WHO HAD TAKEN IN SO MANY IDEAS COULD MAKE ROOM FOR WASUNMIXEDLY KIND. SINCE DOROTHEA DID NOT SPEAK IMMEDIATELY HE REPEATEDI THOUGHT IT BETTER TO TELL YOU MY DEAR.THANK YOU UNCLE SAID DOROTHEA IN A CLEAR UNWAVERING TONE. I AMVERY GRATEFUL TO MR. CASAUBON. IF HE MAKES ME AN OFFER I SHALL ACCEPTHIM. I ADMIRE AND HONOR HIM MORE THAN ANY MAN I EVER SAW.MR.

I SHALL NEVER INTERFERE AGAINST YOURWISHES MY DEAR. PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THEIR OWN WAY IN MARRIAGE AND THATSORT OF THINGUP TO A CERTAIN POINT YOU KNOW. I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THATUP TO A CERTAIN POINT.

IF HE THINKS OF MARRYING ME HE HAS MADE A GREAT MISTAKE.THAT IS IT YOU SEE. ONE NEVER KNOWS. I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT CHETTAMWAS JUST THE SORT OF MAN A WOMAN WOULD LIKE NOW.PRAY DO NOT MENTION HIM IN THAT LIGHT AGAIN UNCLE SAID DOROTHEAFEELING SOME OF HER LATE IRRITATION REVIVE.MR. BROOKE WONDERED AND FELT THAT WOMEN WERE AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SUBJECTOF STUDY SINCE EVEN HE AT HIS AGE WAS NOT IN A PERFECT STATE OFSCIENTIFIC PREDICTION ABOUT THEM. HERE WAS A FELLOW LIKE CHETTAM WITHNO CHANCE AT ALL.WELL BUT CASAUBON NOW. THERE IS NO HURRYI MEAN FOR YOU. ITS TRUEEVERY YEAR WILL TELL UPON HIM. HE IS OVER FIVEANDFORTY YOU KNOW.

I KNOW NOTHING ELSE AGAINST HIM.I SHOULD NOT WISH TO HAVE A HUSBAND VERY NEAR MY OWN AGE SAIDDOROTHEA WITH GRAVE DECISION. I SHOULD WISH TO HAVE A HUSBAND WHO WASABOVE ME IN JUDGMENT AND IN ALL KNOWLEDGE.MR. BROOKE REPEATED HIS SUBDUED AHI THOUGHT YOU HAD MORE OF YOUROWN OPINION THAN MOST GIRLS. I THOUGHT YOU LIKED YOUR OWN OPINIONLIKEDIT YOU KNOW.I CANNOT IMAGINE MYSELF LIVING WITHOUT SOME OPINIONS BUT I SHOULDWISH TO HAVE GOOD REASONS FOR THEM AND A WISE MAN COULD HELP ME TO SEEWHICH OPINIONS HAD THE BEST FOUNDATION AND WOULD HELP ME TO LIVEACCORDING TO THEM.VERY TRUE. YOU COULDNT PUT THE THING BETTERCOULDNT PUT IT BETTERBEFOREHAND YOU KNOW. BUT THERE ARE ODDITIES IN THINGS CONTINUED MR.BROOKE WHOSE CONSCIENCE WAS REALLY ROUSED TO DO THE BEST HE COULD FORHIS NIECE ON THIS OCCASION. LIFE ISNT CAST IN A MOULDNOT CUT OUT BYRULE AND LINE AND THAT SORT OF THING. I NEVER MARRIED MYSELF AND ITWILL BE THE BETTER FOR YOU AND YOURS. THE FACT IS I NEVER LOVED ANYONE WELL ENOUGH TO PUT MYSELF INTO A NOOSE FOR THEM. IT IS A NOOSEYOU KNOW. TEMPER NOW. THERE IS TEMPER. AND A HUSBAND LIKES TO BEMASTER.I KNOW THAT I MUST EXPECT TRIALS UNCLE. MARRIAGE IS A STATE OF HIGHERDUTIES. I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT AS MERE PERSONAL EASE SAID POORDOROTHEA.WELL YOU ARE NOT FOND OF SHOW A GREAT ESTABLISHMENT BALLS DINNERSTHAT KIND OF THING. I CAN SEE THAT CASAUBONS WAYS MIGHT SUIT YOUBETTER THAN CHETTAMS. AND YOU SHALL DO AS YOU LIKE MY DEAR. I WOULDNOT HINDER CASAUBON I SAID SO AT ONCE FOR THERE IS NO KNOWING HOWANYTHING MAY TURN OUT. YOU HAVE NOT THE SAME TASTES AS EVERY YOUNGLADY AND A CLERGYMAN AND SCHOLARWHO MAY BE A BISHOPTHAT KIND OFTHINGMAY SUIT YOU BETTER THAN CHETTAM. CHETTAM IS A GOOD FELLOW AGOOD SOUNDHEARTED FELLOW YOU KNOW BUT HE DOESNT GO MUCH INTO IDEAS.I DID WHEN I WAS HIS AGE. BUT CASAUBONS EYES NOW. I THINK HE HASHURT THEM A LITTLE WITH TOO MUCH READING.I SHOULD BE ALL THE HAPPIER UNCLE THE MORE ROOM THERE WAS FOR ME TOHELP HIM SAID DOROTHEA ARDENTLY.YOU HAVE QUITE MADE UP YOUR MIND I SEE. WELL MY DEAR THE FACT IS IHAVE A LETTER FOR YOU IN MY POCKET. MR. BROOKE HANDED THE LETTER TODOROTHEA BUT AS SHE ROSE TO GO AWAY HE ADDED THERE IS NOT TOO MUCHHURRY MY DEAR. THINK ABOUT IT YOU KNOW.WHEN DOROTHEA HAD LEFT HIM HE REFLECTED THAT HE HAD CERTAINLY SPOKENSTRONGLY HE HAD PUT THE RISKS OF MARRIAGE BEFORE HER IN A STRIKINGMANNER. IT WAS HIS DUTY TO DO SO. BUT AS TO PRETENDING TO BE WISE FORYOUNG PEOPLENO UNCLE HOWEVER MUCH HE HAD TRAVELLED IN HIS YOUTHABSORBED THE NEW IDEAS AND DINED WITH CELEBRITIES NOW DECEASED COULDPRETEND TO JUDGE WHAT SORT OF MARRIAGE WOULD TURN OUT WELL FOR A YOUNGGIRL WHO PREFERRED CASAUBON TO CHETTAM. IN SHORT WOMAN WAS A PROBLEMWHICH SINCE MR. BROOKES MIND FELT BLANK BEFORE IT COULD BE HARDLYLESS COMPLICATED THAN THE REVOLUTIONS OF AN IRREGULAR SOLID.CHAPTER V.HARD STUDENTS ARE COMMONLY TROUBLED WITH GOWTS CATARRHS RHEUMSCACHEXIA BRADYPEPSIA BAD EYES STONE AND COLLICK CRUDITIESOPPILATIONS VERTIGO WINDS CONSUMPTIONS AND ALL SUCH DISEASES ASCOME BY OVERMUCH SITTING THEY ARE MOST PART LEAN DRY ILLCOLORED AND ALL THROUGH IMMODERATE PAINS AND EXTRAORDINARY STUDIES. IF YOU WILLNOT BELIEVE THE TRUTH OF THIS LOOK UPON GREAT TOSTATUS AND THOMASAQUINAS WORKS AND TELL ME WHETHER THOSE MEN TOOK PAINS.BURTONSANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY P. I S. .THIS WAS MR. CASAUBONS LETTER.MY DEAR MISS BROOKEI HAVE YOUR GUARDIANS PERMISSION TO ADDRESS YOUON A SUBJECT THAN WHICH I HAVE NONE MORE AT HEART. I AM NOT I TRUSTMISTAKEN IN THE RECOGNITION OF SOME DEEPER CORRESPONDENCE THAN THAT OFDATE IN THE FACT THAT A CONSCIOUSNESS OF NEED IN MY OWN LIFE HAD ARISENCONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF MY BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITHYOU. FOR IN THE FIRST HOUR OF MEETING YOU I HAD AN IMPRESSION OF YOUREMINENT AND PERHAPS EXCLUSIVE FITNESS TO SUPPLY THAT NEED CONNECTED IMAY SAY WITH SUCH ACTIVITY OF THE AFFECTIONS AS EVEN THEPREOCCUPATIONS OF A WORK TOO SPECIAL TO BE ABDICATED COULD NOTUNINTERRUPTEDLY DISSIMULATE AND EACH SUCCEEDING OPPORTUNITY FOROBSERVATION HAS GIVEN THE IMPRESSION AN ADDED DEPTH BY CONVINCING MEMORE EMPHATICALLY OF THAT FITNESS WHICH I HAD PRECONCEIVED AND THUSEVOKING MORE DECISIVELY THOSE AFFECTIONS TO WHICH I HAVE BUT NOWREFERRED. OUR CONVERSATIONS HAVE I THINK MADE SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR TOYOU THE TENOR OF MY LIFE AND PURPOSES A TENOR UNSUITED I AM AWARE TOTHE COMMONER ORDER OF MINDS. BUT I HAVE DISCERNED IN YOU AN ELEVATIONOF THOUGHT AND A CAPABILITY OF DEVOTEDNESS WHICH I HAD HITHERTO NOTCONCEIVED TO BE COMPATIBLE EITHER WITH THE EARLY BLOOM OF YOUTH OR WITHTHOSE GRACES OF SEX THAT MAY BE SAID AT ONCE TO WIN AND TO CONFERDISTINCTION WHEN COMBINED AS THEY NOTABLY ARE IN YOU WITH THE MENTALQUALITIES ABOVE INDICATED. IT WAS I CONFESS BEYOND MY HOPE TO MEETWITH THIS RARE COMBINATION OF ELEMENTS BOTH SOLID AND ATTRACTIVEADAPTED TO SUPPLY AID IN GRAVER LABORS AND TO CAST A CHARM OVER VACANTHOURS AND BUT FOR THE EVENT OF MY INTRODUCTION TO YOU WHICH LET MEAGAIN SAY I TRUST NOT TO BE SUPERFICIALLY COINCIDENT WITHFORESHADOWING NEEDS BUT PROVIDENTIALLY RELATED THERETO AS STAGESTOWARDS THE COMPLETION OF A LIFES PLAN I SHOULD PRESUMABLY HAVE GONEON TO THE LAST WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT TO LIGHTEN MY SOLITARINESS BY AMATRIMONIAL UNION.    SUCH MY DEAR MISS BROOKE IS THE ACCURATE STATEMENT OF MY    FEELINGS AND I RELY ON YOUR KIND INDULGENCE IN VENTURING NOW TO    ASK YOU HOW FAR YOUR OWN ARE OF A NATURE TO CONFIRM MY HAPPY    PRESENTIMENT. TO BE ACCEPTED BY YOU AS YOUR HUSBAND AND THE EARTHLY    GUARDIAN OF YOUR WELFARE I SHOULD REGARD AS THE HIGHEST OF    PROVIDENTIAL GIFTS. IN RETURN I CAN AT LEAST OFFER YOU AN AFFECTION    HITHERTO UNWASTED AND THE FAITHFUL CONSECRATION OF A LIFE WHICH    HOWEVER SHORT IN THE SEQUEL HAS NO BACKWARD PAGES WHEREON IF YOU    CHOOSE TO TURN THEM YOU WILL FIND RECORDS SUCH AS MIGHT JUSTLY    CAUSE YOU EITHER BITTERNESS OR SHAME. I AWAIT THE EXPRESSION OF    YOUR SENTIMENTS WITH AN ANXIETY WHICH IT WOULD BE THE PART OF    WISDOM WERE IT POSSIBLE TO DIVERT BY A MORE ARDUOUS LABOR THAN    USUAL. BUT IN THIS ORDER OF EXPERIENCE I AM STILL YOUNG AND IN    LOOKING FORWARD TO AN UNFAVORABLE POSSIBILITY I CANNOT BUT FEEL    THAT RESIGNATION TO SOLITUDE WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT AFTER THE    TEMPORARY ILLUMINATION OF HOPE.IN ANY CASE I SHALL REMAIN    YOURS WITH SINCERE DEVOTION        EDWARD CASAUBON.DOROTHEA TREMBLED WHILE SHE READ THIS LETTER THEN SHE FELL ON HERKNEES BURIED HER FACE AND SOBBED. SHE COULD NOT PRAY UNDER THE RUSHOF SOLEMN EMOTION IN WHICH THOUGHTS BECAME VAGUE AND IMAGES FLOATEDUNCERTAINLY SHE COULD BUT CAST HERSELF WITH A CHILDLIKE SENSE OFRECLINING IN THE LAP OF A DIVINE CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH SUSTAINED HEROWN. SHE REMAINED IN THAT ATTITUDE TILL IT WAS TIME TO DRESS FORDINNER.HOW COULD IT OCCUR TO HER TO EXAMINE THE LETTER TO LOOK AT ITCRITICALLY AS A PROFESSION OF LOVE HER WHOLE SOUL WAS POSSESSED BY THEFACT THAT A FULLER LIFE WAS OPENING BEFORE HER SHE WAS A NEOPHYTEABOUT TO ENTER ON A HIGHER GRADE OF INITIATION. SHE WAS GOING TO HAVEROOM FOR THE ENERGIES WHICH STIRRED UNEASILY UNDER THE DIMNESS ANDPRESSURE OF HER OWN IGNORANCE AND THE PETTY PEREMPTORINESS OF THEWORLDS HABITS.NOW SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO DEVOTE HERSELF TO LARGE YET DEFINITE DUTIESNOW SHE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO LIVE CONTINUALLY IN THE LIGHT OF A MINDTHAT SHE COULD REVERENCE. THIS HOPE WAS NOT UNMIXED WITH THE GLOW OFPROUD DELIGHTTHE JOYOUS MAIDEN SURPRISE THAT SHE WAS CHOSEN BY THE MANWHOM HER ADMIRATION HAD CHOSEN. ALL DOROTHEAS PASSION WAS TRANSFUSEDTHROUGH A MIND STRUGGLING TOWARDS AN IDEAL LIFE THE RADIANCE OF HERTRANSFIGURED GIRLHOOD FELL ON THE FIRST OBJECT THAT CAME WITHIN ITSLEVEL. THE IMPETUS WITH WHICH INCLINATION BECAME RESOLUTION WASHEIGHTENED BY THOSE LITTLE EVENTS OF THE DAY WHICH HAD ROUSED HERDISCONTENT WITH THE ACTUAL CONDITIONS OF HER LIFE.AFTER DINNER WHEN CELIA WAS PLAYING AN AIR WITH VARIATIONS A SMALLKIND OF TINKLING WHICH SYMBOLIZED THE AESTHETIC PART OF THE YOUNGLADIES EDUCATION DOROTHEA WENT UP TO HER ROOM TO ANSWER MR.CASAUBONS LETTER. WHY SHOULD SHE DEFER THE ANSWER SHE WROTE IT OVERTHREE TIMES NOT BECAUSE SHE WISHED TO CHANGE THE WORDING BUT BECAUSEHER HAND WAS UNUSUALLY UNCERTAIN AND SHE COULD NOT BEAR THAT MR.CASAUBON SHOULD THINK HER HANDWRITING BAD AND ILLEGIBLE. SHE PIQUEDHERSELF ON WRITING A HAND IN WHICH EACH LETTER WAS DISTINGUISHABLEWITHOUT ANY LARGE RANGE OF CONJECTURE AND SHE MEANT TO MAKE MUCH USEOF THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT TO SAVE MR. CASAUBONS EYES. THREE TIMES SHEWROTE.MY DEAR MR. CASAUBONI AM VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR LOVING ME ANDTHINKING ME WORTHY TO BE YOUR WIFE. I CAN LOOK FORWARD TO NO BETTERHAPPINESS THAN THAT WHICH WOULD BE ONE WITH YOURS. IF I SAID MORE ITWOULD ONLY BE THE SAME THING WRITTEN OUT AT GREATER LENGTH FOR ICANNOT NOW DWELL ON ANY OTHER THOUGHT THAN THAT I MAY BE THROUGH LIFEYOURS DEVOTEDLY    DOROTHEA BROOKE.LATER IN THE EVENING SHE FOLLOWED HER UNCLE INTO THE LIBRARY TO GIVEHIM THE LETTER THAT HE MIGHT SEND IT IN THE MORNING. HE WAS SURPRISEDBUT HIS SURPRISE ONLY ISSUED IN A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE DURING WHICH HEPUSHED ABOUT VARIOUS OBJECTS ON HIS WRITINGTABLE AND FINALLY STOODWITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE HIS GLASSES ON HIS NOSE LOOKING AT THEADDRESS OF DOROTHEAS LETTER.HAVE YOU THOUGHT ENOUGH ABOUT THIS MY DEAR HE SAID AT LAST.THERE WAS NO NEED TO THINK LONG UNCLE. I KNOW OF NOTHING TO MAKE MEVACILLATE. IF I CHANGED MY MIND IT MUST BE BECAUSE OF SOMETHINGIMPORTANT AND ENTIRELY NEW TO ME.AHTHEN YOU HAVE ACCEPTED HIM THEN CHETTAM HAS NO CHANCE HASCHETTAM OFFENDED YOUOFFENDED YOU YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT YOU DONT LIKEIN CHETTAMTHERE IS NOTHING THAT I LIKE IN HIM SAID DOROTHEA RATHERIMPETUOUSLY.MR. BROOKE THREW HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS BACKWARD AS IF SOME ONE HADTHROWN A LIGHT MISSILE AT HIM. DOROTHEA IMMEDIATELY FELT SOMESELFREBUKE AND SAIDI MEAN IN THE LIGHT OF A HUSBAND. HE IS VERY KIND I THINKREALLY VERYGOOD ABOUT THE COTTAGES. A WELLMEANING MAN.BUT YOU MUST HAVE A SCHOLAR AND THAT SORT OF THING WELL IT LIES ALITTLE IN OUR FAMILY. I HAD IT MYSELFTHAT LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE AND GOINGINTO EVERYTHINGA LITTLE TOO MUCHIT TOOK ME TOO FAR THOUGH THAT SORTOF THING DOESNT OFTEN RUN IN THE FEMALELINE OR IT RUNS UNDERGROUNDLIKE THE RIVERS IN GREECE YOU KNOWIT COMES OUT IN THE SONS. CLEVERSONS CLEVER MOTHERS. I WENT A GOOD DEAL INTO THAT AT ONE TIME.HOWEVER MY DEAR I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT PEOPLE SHOULD DO AS THEY LIKEIN THESE THINGS UP TO A CERTAIN POINT. I COULDNT AS YOUR GUARDIANHAVE CONSENTED TO A BAD MATCH. BUT CASAUBON STANDS WELL HIS POSITIONIS GOOD. I AM AFRAID CHETTAM WILL BE HURT THOUGH AND MRS. CADWALLADERWILL BLAME ME.THAT EVENING OF COURSE CELIA KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED. SHEATTRIBUTED DOROTHEAS ABSTRACTED MANNER AND THE EVIDENCE OF FURTHERCRYING SINCE THEY HAD GOT HOME TO THE TEMPER SHE HAD BEEN IN ABOUT SIRJAMES CHETTAM AND THE BUILDINGS AND WAS CAREFUL NOT TO GIVE FURTHEROFFENCE HAVING ONCE SAID WHAT SHE WANTED TO SAY CELIA HAD NODISPOSITION TO RECUR TO DISAGREEABLE SUBJECTS. IT HAD BEEN HER NATUREWHEN A CHILD NEVER TO QUARREL WITH ANY ONEONLY TO OBSERVE WITH WONDERTHAT THEY QUARRELLED WITH HER AND LOOKED LIKE TURKEYCOCKS WHEREUPONSHE WAS READY TO PLAY AT CATS CRADLE WITH THEM WHENEVER THEY RECOVEREDTHEMSELVES. AND AS TO DOROTHEA IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN HER WAY TO FINDSOMETHING WRONG IN HER SISTERS WORDS THOUGH CELIA INWARDLY PROTESTEDTHAT SHE ALWAYS SAID JUST HOW THINGS WERE AND NOTHING ELSE SHE NEVERDID AND NEVER COULD PUT WORDS TOGETHER OUT OF HER OWN HEAD. BUT THEBEST OF DODO WAS THAT SHE DID NOT KEEP ANGRY FOR LONG TOGETHER. NOWTHOUGH THEY HAD HARDLY SPOKEN TO EACH OTHER ALL THE EVENING YET WHENCELIA PUT BY HER WORK INTENDING TO GO TO BED A PROCEEDING IN WHICHSHE WAS ALWAYS MUCH THE EARLIER DOROTHEA WHO WAS SEATED ON A LOWSTOOL UNABLE TO OCCUPY HERSELF EXCEPT IN MEDITATION SAID WITH THEMUSICAL INTONATION WHICH IN MOMENTS OF DEEP BUT QUIET FEELING MADE HERSPEECH LIKE A FINE BIT OF RECITATIVECELIA DEAR COME AND KISS ME HOLDING HER ARMS OPEN AS SHE SPOKE.CELIA KNELT DOWN TO GET THE RIGHT LEVEL AND GAVE HER LITTLE BUTTERFLYKISS WHILE DOROTHEA ENCIRCLED HER WITH GENTLE ARMS AND PRESSED HERLIPS GRAVELY ON EACH CHEEK IN TURN.DONT SIT UP DODO YOU ARE SO PALE TONIGHT GO TO BED SOON SAIDCELIA IN A COMFORTABLE WAY WITHOUT ANY TOUCH OF PATHOS.NO DEAR I AM VERY VERY HAPPY SAID DOROTHEA FERVENTLY.SO MUCH THE BETTER THOUGHT CELIA. BUT HOW STRANGELY DODO GOES FROMONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER.THE NEXT DAY AT LUNCHEON THE BUTLER HANDING SOMETHING TO MR. BROOKESAID JONAS IS COME BACK SIR AND HAS BROUGHT THIS LETTER.MR. BROOKE READ THE LETTER AND THEN NODDING TOWARD DOROTHEA SAIDCASAUBON MY DEAR HE WILL BE HERE TO DINNER HE DIDNT WAIT TO WRITEMOREDIDNT WAIT YOU KNOW.IT COULD NOT SEEM REMARKABLE TO CELIA THAT A DINNER GUEST SHOULD BEANNOUNCED TO HER SISTER BEFOREHAND BUT HER EYES FOLLOWING THE SAMEDIRECTION AS HER UNCLES SHE WAS STRUCK WITH THE PECULIAR EFFECT OFTHE ANNOUNCEMENT ON DOROTHEA. IT SEEMED AS IF SOMETHING LIKE THEREFLECTION OF A WHITE SUNLIT WING HAD PASSED ACROSS HER FEATURESENDING IN ONE OF HER RARE BLUSHES. FOR THE FIRST TIME IT ENTERED INTOCELIAS MIND THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING MORE BETWEEN MR. CASAUBONAND HER SISTER THAN HIS DELIGHT IN BOOKISH TALK AND HER DELIGHT INLISTENING. HITHERTO SHE HAD CLASSED THE ADMIRATION FOR THIS UGLY ANDLEARNED ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ADMIRATION FOR MONSIEUR LIRET ATLAUSANNE ALSO UGLY AND LEARNED. DOROTHEA HAD NEVER BEEN TIRED OFLISTENING TO OLD MONSIEUR LIRET WHEN CELIAS FEET WERE AS COLD ASPOSSIBLE AND WHEN IT HAD REALLY BECOME DREADFUL TO SEE THE SKIN OF HISBALD HEAD MOVING ABOUT. WHY THEN SHOULD HER ENTHUSIASM NOT EXTEND TOMR. CASAUBON SIMPLY IN THE SAME WAY AS TO MONSIEUR LIRET AND IT SEEMEDPROBABLE THAT ALL LEARNED MEN HAD A SORT OF SCHOOLMASTERS VIEW OFYOUNG PEOPLE.BUT NOW CELIA WAS REALLY STARTLED AT THE SUSPICION WHICH HAD DARTEDINTO HER MIND. SHE WAS SELDOM TAKEN BY SURPRISE IN THIS WAY HERMARVELLOUS QUICKNESS IN OBSERVING A CERTAIN ORDER OF SIGNS GENERALLYPREPARING HER TO EXPECT SUCH OUTWARD EVENTS AS SHE HAD AN INTEREST IN.NOT THAT SHE NOW IMAGINED MR. CASAUBON TO BE ALREADY AN ACCEPTED LOVERSHE HAD ONLY BEGUN TO FEEL DISGUST AT THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANYTHING INDOROTHEAS MIND COULD TEND TOWARDS SUCH AN ISSUE. HERE WAS SOMETHINGREALLY TO VEX HER ABOUT DODO IT WAS ALL VERY WELL NOT TO ACCEPT SIRJAMES CHETTAM BUT THE IDEA OF MARRYING MR. CASAUBON CELIA FELT A SORTOF SHAME MINGLED WITH A SENSE OF THE LUDICROUS. BUT PERHAPS DODO IFSHE WERE REALLY BORDERING ON SUCH AN EXTRAVAGANCE MIGHT BE TURNED AWAYFROM IT EXPERIENCE HAD OFTEN SHOWN THAT HER IMPRESSIBILITY MIGHT BECALCULATED ON. THE DAY WAS DAMP AND THEY WERE NOT GOING TO WALK OUTSO THEY BOTH WENT UP TO THEIR SITTINGROOM AND THERE CELIA OBSERVEDTHAT DOROTHEA INSTEAD OF SETTLING DOWN WITH HER USUAL DILIGENTINTEREST TO SOME OCCUPATION SIMPLY LEANED HER ELBOW ON AN OPEN BOOKAND LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE GREAT CEDAR SILVERED WITH THE DAMP.SHE HERSELF HAD TAKEN UP THE MAKING OF A TOY FOR THE CURATES CHILDRENAND WAS NOT GOING TO ENTER ON ANY SUBJECT TOO PRECIPITATELY.DOROTHEA WAS IN FACT THINKING THAT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR CELIA TO KNOWOF THE MOMENTOUS CHANGE IN MR. CASAUBONS POSITION SINCE HE HAD LASTBEEN IN THE HOUSE IT DID NOT SEEM FAIR TO LEAVE HER IN IGNORANCE OFWHAT WOULD NECESSARILY AFFECT HER ATTITUDE TOWARDS HIM BUT IT WASIMPOSSIBLE NOT TO SHRINK FROM TELLING HER. DOROTHEA ACCUSED HERSELF OFSOME MEANNESS IN THIS TIMIDITY IT WAS ALWAYS ODIOUS TO HER TO HAVE ANYSMALL FEARS OR CONTRIVANCES ABOUT HER ACTIONS BUT AT THIS MOMENT SHEWAS SEEKING THE HIGHEST AID POSSIBLE THAT SHE MIGHT NOT DREAD THECORROSIVENESS OF CELIAS PRETTY CARNALLY MINDED PROSE. HER REVERIE WASBROKEN AND THE DIFFICULTY OF DECISION BANISHED BY CELIAS SMALL ANDRATHER GUTTURAL VOICE SPEAKING IN ITS USUAL TONE OF A REMARK ASIDE ORA BY THE BYE.IS ANY ONE ELSE COMING TO DINE BESIDES MR. CASAUBONNOT THAT I KNOW OF.I HOPE THERE IS SOME ONE ELSE. THEN I SHALL NOT HEAR HIM EAT HIS SOUPSO.WHAT IS THERE REMARKABLE ABOUT HIS SOUPEATINGREALLY DODO CANT YOU HEAR HOW HE SCRAPES HIS SPOON AND HE ALWAYSBLINKS BEFORE HE SPEAKS. I DONT KNOW WHETHER LOCKE BLINKED BUT IMSURE I AM SORRY FOR THOSE WHO SAT OPPOSITE TO HIM IF HE DID.CELIA SAID DOROTHEA WITH EMPHATIC GRAVITY PRAY DONT MAKE ANYMORE OBSERVATIONS OF THAT KIND.WHY NOT THEY ARE QUITE TRUE RETURNED CELIA WHO HAD HER REASONS FORPERSEVERING THOUGH SHE WAS BEGINNING TO BE A LITTLE AFRAID.MANY THINGS ARE TRUE WHICH ONLY THE COMMONEST MINDS OBSERVE.THEN I THINK THE COMMONEST MINDS MUST BE RATHER USEFUL. I THINK IT ISA PITY MR. CASAUBONS MOTHER HAD NOT A COMMONER MIND SHE MIGHT HAVETAUGHT HIM BETTER. CELIA WAS INWARDLY FRIGHTENED AND READY TO RUNAWAY NOW SHE HAD HURLED THIS LIGHT JAVELIN.DOROTHEAS FEELINGS HAD GATHERED TO AN AVALANCHE AND THERE COULD BE NOFURTHER PREPARATION.IT IS RIGHT TO TELL YOU CELIA THAT I AM ENGAGED TO MARRY MR.CASAUBON.PERHAPS CELIA HAD NEVER TURNED SO PALE BEFORE. THE PAPER MAN SHE WASMAKING WOULD HAVE HAD HIS LEG INJURED BUT FOR HER HABITUAL CARE OFWHATEVER SHE HELD IN HER HANDS. SHE LAID THE FRAGILE FIGURE DOWN ATONCE AND SAT PERFECTLY STILL FOR A FEW MOMENTS. WHEN SHE SPOKE THEREWAS A TEAR GATHERING.OH DODO I HOPE YOU WILL BE HAPPY. HER SISTERLY TENDERNESS COULD NOTBUT SURMOUNT OTHER FEELINGS AT THIS MOMENT AND HER FEARS WERE THEFEARS OF AFFECTION.DOROTHEA WAS STILL HURT AND AGITATED.IT IS QUITE DECIDED THEN SAID CELIA IN AN AWED UNDER TONE. ANDUNCLE KNOWSI HAVE ACCEPTED MR. CASAUBONS OFFER. MY UNCLE BROUGHT ME THE LETTERTHAT CONTAINED IT HE KNEW ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND.I BEG YOUR PARDON IF I HAVE SAID ANYTHING TO HURT YOU DODO SAIDCELIA WITH A SLIGHT SOB. SHE NEVER COULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT SHE SHOULDFEEL AS SHE DID. THERE WAS SOMETHING FUNEREAL IN THE WHOLE AFFAIR ANDMR. CASAUBON SEEMED TO BE THE OFFICIATING CLERGYMAN ABOUT WHOM ITWOULD BE INDECENT TO MAKE REMARKS.NEVER MIND KITTY DO NOT GRIEVE. WE SHOULD NEVER ADMIRE THE SAMEPEOPLE. I OFTEN OFFEND IN SOMETHING OF THE SAME WAY I AM APT TO SPEAKTOO STRONGLY OF THOSE WHO DONT PLEASE ME.IN SPITE OF THIS MAGNANIMITY DOROTHEA WAS STILL SMARTING PERHAPS ASMUCH FROM CELIAS SUBDUED ASTONISHMENT AS FROM HER SMALL CRITICISMS. OFCOURSE ALL THE WORLD ROUND TIPTON WOULD BE OUT OF SYMPATHY WITH THISMARRIAGE. DOROTHEA KNEW OF NO ONE WHO THOUGHT AS SHE DID ABOUT LIFE ANDITS BEST OBJECTS.NEVERTHELESS BEFORE THE EVENING WAS AT AN END SHE WAS VERY HAPPY. IN ANHOURS TTETTE WITH MR. CASAUBON SHE TALKED TO HIM WITH MOREFREEDOM THAN SHE HAD EVER FELT BEFORE EVEN POURING OUT HER JOY AT THETHOUGHT OF DEVOTING HERSELF TO HIM AND OF LEARNING HOW SHE MIGHT BESTSHARE AND FURTHER ALL HIS GREAT ENDS. MR. CASAUBON WAS TOUCHED WITH ANUNKNOWN DELIGHT WHAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AT THIS CHILDLIKEUNRESTRAINED ARDOR HE WAS NOT SURPRISED WHAT LOVER WOULD HAVE BEENTHAT HE SHOULD BE THE OBJECT OF IT.MY DEAR YOUNG LADYMISS BROOKEDOROTHEA HE SAID PRESSING HER HANDBETWEEN HIS HANDS THIS IS A HAPPINESS GREATER THAN I HAD EVERIMAGINED TO BE IN RESERVE FOR ME. THAT I SHOULD EVER MEET WITH A MINDAND PERSON SO RICH IN THE MINGLED GRACES WHICH COULD RENDER MARRIAGEDESIRABLE WAS FAR INDEED FROM MY CONCEPTION. YOU HAVE ALLNAY MORETHAN ALLTHOSE QUALITIES WHICH I HAVE EVER REGARDED AS THECHARACTERISTIC EXCELLENCES OF WOMANHOOD. THE GREAT CHARM OF YOUR SEX ISITS CAPABILITY OF AN ARDENT SELFSACRIFICING AFFECTION AND HEREIN WESEE ITS FITNESS TO ROUND AND COMPLETE THE EXISTENCE OF OUR OWN.HITHERTO I HAVE KNOWN FEW PLEASURES SAVE OF THE SEVERER KIND MYSATISFACTIONS HAVE BEEN THOSE OF THE SOLITARY STUDENT. I HAVE BEENLITTLE DISPOSED TO GATHER FLOWERS THAT WOULD WITHER IN MY HAND BUT NOWI SHALL PLUCK THEM WITH EAGERNESS TO PLACE THEM IN YOUR BOSOM.NO SPEECH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE THOROUGHLY HONEST IN ITS INTENTION THEFRIGID RHETORIC AT THE END WAS AS SINCERE AS THE BARK OF A DOG OR THECAWING OF AN AMOROUS ROOK. WOULD IT NOT BE RASH TO CONCLUDE THAT THEREWAS NO PASSION BEHIND THOSE SONNETS TO DELIA WHICH STRIKE US AS THETHIN MUSIC OF A MANDOLINDOROTHEAS FAITH SUPPLIED ALL THAT MR. CASAUBONS WORDS SEEMED TO LEAVEUNSAID WHAT BELIEVER SEES A DISTURBING OMISSION OR INFELICITY THETEXT WHETHER OF PROPHET OR OF POET EXPANDS FOR WHATEVER WE CAN PUTINTO IT AND EVEN HIS BAD GRAMMAR IS SUBLIME.I AM VERY IGNORANTYOU WILL QUITE WONDER AT MY IGNORANCE SAIDDOROTHEA. I HAVE SO MANY THOUGHTS THAT MAY BE QUITE MISTAKEN AND NOWI SHALL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM ALL TO YOU AND ASK YOU ABOUT THEM. BUTSHE ADDED WITH RAPID IMAGINATION OF MR. CASAUBONS PROBABLE FEELINGI WILL NOT TROUBLE YOU TOO MUCH ONLY WHEN YOU ARE INCLINED TO LISTENTO ME. YOU MUST OFTEN BE WEARY WITH THE PURSUIT OF SUBJECTS IN YOUR OWNTRACK. I SHALL GAIN ENOUGH IF YOU WILL TAKE ME WITH YOU THERE.HOW SHOULD I BE ABLE NOW TO PERSEVERE IN ANY PATH WITHOUT YOURCOMPANIONSHIP SAID MR. CASAUBON KISSING HER CANDID BROW AND FEELINGTHAT HEAVEN HAD VOUCHSAFED HIM A BLESSING IN EVERY WAY SUITED TO HISPECULIAR WANTS. HE WAS BEING UNCONSCIOUSLY WROUGHT UPON BY THE CHARMSOF A NATURE WHICH WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT HIDDEN CALCULATIONS EITHER FORIMMEDIATE EFFECTS OR FOR REMOTER ENDS. IT WAS THIS WHICH MADE DOROTHEASO CHILDLIKE AND ACCORDING TO SOME JUDGES SO STUPID WITH ALL HERREPUTED CLEVERNESS AS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE PRESENT CASE OF THROWINGHERSELF METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING AT MR. CASAUBONS FEET AND KISSINGHIS UNFASHIONABLE SHOETIES AS IF HE WERE A PROTESTANT POPE. SHE WASNOT IN THE LEAST TEACHING MR. CASAUBON TO ASK IF HE WERE GOOD ENOUGHFOR HER BUT MERELY ASKING HERSELF ANXIOUSLY HOW SHE COULD BE GOODENOUGH FOR MR. CASAUBON. BEFORE HE LEFT THE NEXT DAY IT HAD BEENDECIDED THAT THE MARRIAGE SHOULD TAKE PLACE WITHIN SIX WEEKS. WHY NOTMR. CASAUBONS HOUSE WAS READY. IT WAS NOT A PARSONAGE BUT ACONSIDERABLE MANSION WITH MUCH LAND ATTACHED TO IT. THE PARSONAGE WASINHABITED BY THE CURATE WHO DID ALL THE DUTY EXCEPT PREACHING THEMORNING SERMON.CHAPTER VI.MY LADYS TONGUE IS LIKE THE MEADOW BLADESTHAT CUT YOU STROKING THEM WITH IDLE HAND.NICE CUTTING IS HER FUNCTION SHE DIVIDESWITH SPIRITUAL EDGE THE MILLETSEEDAND MAKES INTANGIBLE SAVINGS.AS MR. CASAUBONS CARRIAGE WAS PASSING OUT OF THE GATEWAY IT ARRESTEDTHE ENTRANCE OF A PONY PHAETON DRIVEN BY A LADY WITH A SERVANT SEATEDBEHIND. IT WAS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE RECOGNITION HAD BEEN MUTUAL FORMR. CASAUBON WAS LOOKING ABSENTLY BEFORE HIM BUT THE LADY WASQUICKEYED AND THREW A NOD AND A HOW DO YOU DO IN THE NICK OF TIME.IN SPITE OF HER SHABBY BONNET AND VERY OLD INDIAN SHAWL IT WAS PLAINTHAT THE LODGEKEEPER REGARDED HER AS AN IMPORTANT PERSONAGE FROM THELOW CURTSY WHICH WAS DROPPED ON THE ENTRANCE OF THE SMALL PHAETON.WELL MRS. FITCHETT HOW ARE YOUR FOWLS LAYING NOW SAID THEHIGHCOLORED DARKEYED LADY WITH THE CLEAREST CHISELLED UTTERANCE.PRETTY WELL FOR LAYING MADAM BUT THEYVE TAEN TO EATING THEIR EGGSIVE NO PEACE O MIND WITH EM AT ALL.OH THE CANNIBALS BETTER SELL THEM CHEAP AT ONCE.

A PAIR OF CHURCHPIGEONS FOR A COUPLE OF WICKED SPANISH FOWLS THAT EAT THEIR OWN EGGSDONT YOU AND FITCHETT BOAST TOO MUCH THAT IS ALLTHE PHAETON WAS DRIVEN ONWARDS WITH THE LAST WORDS LEAVING MRS.FITCHETT LAUGHING AND SHAKING HER HEAD SLOWLY WITH AN INTERJECTIONALSURELY SURELYFROM WHICH IT MIGHT BE INFERRED THAT SHE WOULDHAVE FOUND THE COUNTRYSIDE SOMEWHAT DULLER IF THE RECTORS LADY HADBEEN LESS FREESPOKEN AND LESS OF A SKINFLINT. INDEED BOTH THE FARMERSAND LABORERS IN THE PARISHES OF FRESHITT AND TIPTON WOULD HAVE FELT ASAD LACK OF CONVERSATION BUT FOR THE STORIES ABOUT WHAT MRS.CADWALLADER SAID AND DID A LADY OF IMMEASURABLY HIGH BIRTH DESCENDEDAS IT WERE FROM UNKNOWN EARLS DIM AS THE CROWD OF HEROIC SHADESWHOPLEADED POVERTY PARED DOWN PRICES AND CUT JOKES IN THE MOSTCOMPANIONABLE MANNER THOUGH WITH A TURN OF TONGUE THAT LET YOU KNOWWHO SHE WAS. SUCH A LADY GAVE A NEIGHBORLINESS TO BOTH RANK ANDRELIGION AND MITIGATED THE BITTERNESS OF UNCOMMUTED TITHE. A MUCH MOREEXEMPLARY CHARACTER WITH AN INFUSION OF SOUR DIGNITY WOULD NOT HAVEFURTHERED THEIR COMPREHENSION OF THE THIRTYNINE ARTICLES AND WOULDHAVE BEEN LESS SOCIALLY UNITING.MR. BROOKE SEEING MRS. CADWALLADERS MERITS FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OFVIEW WINCED A LITTLE WHEN HER NAME WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE LIBRARY WHEREHE WAS SITTING ALONE.I SEE YOU HAVE HAD OUR LOWICK CICERO HERE SHE SAID SEATING HERSELFCOMFORTABLY THROWING BACK HER WRAPS AND SHOWING A THIN BUT WELLBUILTFIGURE. I SUSPECT YOU AND HE ARE BREWING SOME BAD POLITIES ELSE YOUWOULD NOT BE SEEING SO MUCH OF THE LIVELY MAN. I SHALL INFORM AGAINSTYOU REMEMBER YOU ARE BOTH SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS SINCE YOU TOOK PEELSSIDE ABOUT THE CATHOLIC BILL. I SHALL TELL EVERYBODY THAT YOU ARE GOINGTO PUT UP FOR MIDDLEMARCH ON THE WHIG SIDE WHEN OLD PINKERTON RESIGNSAND THAT CASAUBON IS GOING TO HELP YOU IN AN UNDERHAND MANNER GOING TOBRIBE THE VOTERS WITH PAMPHLETS AND THROW OPEN THE PUBLICHOUSES TODISTRIBUTE THEM. COME CONFESSNOTHING OF THE SORT SAID MR. BROOKE SMILING AND RUBBING HISEYEGLASSES BUT REALLY BLUSHING A LITTLE AT THE IMPEACHMENT. CASAUBONAND I DONT TALK POLITICS MUCH.

BROOKE NOT WISHING TOBETRAY HOW LITTLE HE ENJOYED THIS PROPHETIC SKETCHWHAT I EXPECT AS ANINDEPENDENT MAN. AS TO THE WHIGS A MAN WHO GOES WITH THE THINKERS ISNOT LIKELY TO BE HOOKED ON BY ANY PARTY. HE MAY GO WITH THEM UP TO ACERTAIN POINTUP TO A CERTAIN POINT YOU KNOW. BUT THAT IS WHAT YOULADIES NEVER UNDERSTAND.WHERE YOUR CERTAIN POINT IS NO. I SHOULD LIKE TO BE TOLD HOW A MANCAN HAVE ANY CERTAIN POINT WHEN HE BELONGS TO NO PARTYLEADING A ROVINGLIFE AND NEVER LETTING HIS FRIENDS KNOW HIS ADDRESS.

BROOKEWITH AN AIR OF SMILING INDIFFERENCE BUT FEELING RATHER UNPLEASANTLYCONSCIOUS THAT THIS ATTACK OF MRS. CADWALLADERS HAD OPENED THEDEFENSIVE CAMPAIGN TO WHICH CERTAIN RASH STEPS HAD EXPOSED HIM. YOURSEX ARE NOT THINKERS YOU KNOWVARIUM ET MUTABILE SEMPERTHAT KIND OFTHING. YOU DONT KNOW VIRGIL. I KNEWMR. BROOKE REFLECTED IN TIME THATHE HAD NOT HAD THE PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE OF THE AUGUSTAN POETI WASGOING TO SAY POOR STODDART YOU KNOW. THAT WAS WHAT HE SAID. YOULADIES ARE ALWAYS AGAINST AN INDEPENDENT ATTITUDEA MANS CARING FORNOTHING BUT TRUTH AND THAT SORT OF THING. AND THERE IS NO PART OF THECOUNTY WHERE OPINION IS NARROWER THAN IT IS HEREI DONT MEAN TO THROWSTONES YOU KNOW BUT SOMEBODY IS WANTED TO TAKE THE INDEPENDENT LINEAND IF I DONT TAKE IT WHO WILLWHO WHY ANY UPSTART WHO HAS GOT NEITHER BLOOD NOR POSITION.

SIR JAMES WOULD BE CRUELLY ANNOYEDIT WILL BE TOO HARD ON HIM IF YOU TURN ROUND NOW AND MAKE YOURSELF AWHIG SIGNBOARD.MR. BROOKE AGAIN WINCED INWARDLY FOR DOROTHEAS ENGAGEMENT HAD NOSOONER BEEN DECIDED THAN HE HAD THOUGHT OF MRS. CADWALLADERSPROSPECTIVE TAUNTS. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EASY FOR IGNORANT OBSERVERS TOSAY QUARREL WITH MRS. CADWALLADER BUT WHERE IS A COUNTRY GENTLEMANTO GO WHO QUARRELS WITH HIS OLDEST NEIGHBORS WHO COULD TASTE THE FINEFLAVOR IN THE NAME OF BROOKE IF IT WERE DELIVERED CASUALLY LIKE WINEWITHOUT A SEAL CERTAINLY A MAN CAN ONLY BE COSMOPOLITAN UP TO ACERTAIN POINT.I HOPE CHETTAM AND I SHALL ALWAYS BE GOOD FRIENDS BUT I AM SORRY TOSAY THERE IS NO PROSPECT OF HIS MARRYING MY NIECE SAID MR. BROOKEMUCH RELIEVED TO SEE THROUGH THE WINDOW THAT CELIA WAS COMING IN.WHY NOT SAID MRS. CADWALLADER WITH A SHARP NOTE OF SURPRISE. IT ISHARDLY A FORTNIGHT SINCE YOU AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT IT.MY NIECE HAS CHOSEN ANOTHER SUITORHAS CHOSEN HIM YOU KNOW. I HAVEHAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. I SHOULD HAVE PREFERRED CHETTAM AND ISHOULD HAVE SAID CHETTAM WAS THE MAN ANY GIRL WOULD HAVE CHOSEN. BUTTHERE IS NO ACCOUNTING FOR THESE THINGS. YOUR SEX IS CAPRICIOUS YOUKNOW.WHY WHOM DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO LET HER MARRYMRS. CADWALLADERS MIND WAS RAPIDLY SURVEYING THE POSSIBILITIES OFCHOICE FOR DOROTHEA.BUT HERE CELIA ENTERED BLOOMING FROM A WALK IN THE GARDEN AND THEGREETING WITH HER DELIVERED MR. BROOKE FROM THE NECESSITY OF ANSWERINGIMMEDIATELY. HE GOT UP HASTILY AND SAYING BY THE WAY I MUST SPEAKTO WRIGHT ABOUT THE HORSES SHUFFLED QUICKLY OUT OF THE ROOM.MY DEAR CHILD WHAT IS THISTHIS ABOUT YOUR SISTERS ENGAGEMENTSAID MRS. CADWALLADER.SHE IS ENGAGED TO MARRY MR. CASAUBON SAID CELIA RESORTING ASUSUAL TO THE SIMPLEST STATEMENT OF FACT AND ENJOYING THIS OPPORTUNITYOF SPEAKING TO THE RECTORS WIFE ALONE.THIS IS FRIGHTFUL.

SO YOUR SISTER NEVER CARED ABOUTSIR JAMES CHETTAM WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE SAID TO HIM FOR ABROTHERINLAWI SHOULD HAVE LIKED THAT VERY MUCH. I AM SURE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AGOOD HUSBAND. ONLY CELIA ADDED WITH A SLIGHT BLUSH SHE SOMETIMESSEEMED TO BLUSH AS SHE BREATHED I DONT THINK HE WOULD HAVE SUITEDDOROTHEA.NOT HIGHFLOWN ENOUGHDODO IS VERY STRICT. SHE THINKS SO MUCH ABOUT EVERYTHING AND IS SOPARTICULAR ABOUT WHAT ONE SAYS. SIR JAMES NEVER SEEMED TO PLEASE HER.SHE MUST HAVE ENCOURAGED HIM I AM SURE. THAT IS NOT VERY CREDITABLE.PLEASE DONT BE ANGRY WITH DODO SHE DOES NOT SEE THINGS. SHE THOUGHTSO MUCH ABOUT THE COTTAGES AND SHE WAS RUDE TO SIR JAMES SOMETIMESBUT HE IS SO KIND HE NEVER NOTICED IT.WELL SAID MRS. CADWALLADER PUTTING ON HER SHAWL AND RISING AS IFIN HASTE I MUST GO STRAIGHT TO SIR JAMES AND BREAK THIS TO HIM. HEWILL HAVE BROUGHT HIS MOTHER BACK BY THIS TIME AND I MUST CALL. YOURUNCLE WILL NEVER TELL HIM. WE ARE ALL DISAPPOINTED MY DEAR. YOUNGPEOPLE SHOULD THINK OF THEIR FAMILIES IN MARRYING. I SET A BADEXAMPLEMARRIED A POOR CLERGYMAN AND MADE MYSELF A PITIABLE OBJECTAMONG THE DE BRACYSOBLIGED TO GET MY COALS BY STRATAGEM AND PRAY TOHEAVEN FOR MY SALAD OIL. HOWEVER CASAUBON HAS MONEY ENOUGH I MUST DOHIM THAT JUSTICE. AS TO HIS BLOOD I SUPPOSE THE FAMILY QUARTERINGS ARETHREE CUTTLEFISH SABLE AND A COMMENTATOR RAMPANT. BY THE BYE BEFOREI GO MY DEAR I MUST SPEAK TO YOUR MRS. CARTER ABOUT PASTRY. I WANT TOSEND MY YOUNG COOK TO LEARN OF HER. POOR PEOPLE WITH FOUR CHILDRENLIKE US YOU KNOW CANT AFFORD TO KEEP A GOOD COOK. I HAVE NO DOUBTMRS. CARTER WILL OBLIGE ME. SIR JAMESS COOK IS A PERFECT DRAGON.IN LESS THAN AN HOUR MRS. CADWALLADER HAD CIRCUMVENTED MRS. CARTER ANDDRIVEN TO FRESHITT HALL WHICH WAS NOT FAR FROM HER OWN PARSONAGE HERHUSBAND BEING RESIDENT IN FRESHITT AND KEEPING A CURATE IN TIPTON.SIR JAMES CHETTAM HAD RETURNED FROM THE SHORT JOURNEY WHICH HAD KEPTHIM ABSENT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND HAD CHANGED HIS DRESS INTENDINGTO RIDE OVER TO TIPTON GRANGE. HIS HORSE WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR WHENMRS. CADWALLADER DROVE UP AND HE IMMEDIATELY APPEARED THERE HIMSELFWHIP IN HAND. LADY CHETTAM HAD NOT YET RETURNED BUT MRS. CADWALLADERSERRAND COULD NOT BE DESPATCHED IN THE PRESENCE OF GROOMS SO SHE ASKEDTO BE TAKEN INTO THE CONSERVATORY CLOSE BY TO LOOK AT THE NEW PLANTSAND ON COMING TO A CONTEMPLATIVE STAND SHE SAIDI HAVE A GREAT SHOCK FOR YOU I HOPE YOU ARE NOT SO FAR GONE IN LOVEAS YOU PRETENDED TO BE.IT WAS OF NO USE PROTESTING AGAINST MRS. CADWALLADERS WAY OF PUTTINGTHINGS. BUT SIR JAMESS COUNTENANCE CHANGED A LITTLE. HE FELT A VAGUEALARM.I DO BELIEVE BROOKE IS GOING TO EXPOSE HIMSELF AFTER ALL. I ACCUSEDHIM OF MEANING TO STAND FOR MIDDLEMARCH ON THE LIBERAL SIDE AND HELOOKED SILLY AND NEVER DENIED ITTALKED ABOUT THE INDEPENDENT LINE ANDTHE USUAL NONSENSE.IS THAT ALL SAID SIR JAMES MUCH RELIEVED.WHY REJOINED MRS. CADWALLADER WITH A SHARPER NOTE YOU DONT MEANTO SAY THAT YOU WOULD LIKE HIM TO TURN PUBLIC MAN IN THAT WAYMAKING ASORT OF POLITICAL CHEAP JACK OF HIMSELFHE MIGHT BE DISSUADED I SHOULD THINK. HE WOULD NOT LIKE THE EXPENSE.THAT IS WHAT I TOLD HIM. HE IS VULNERABLE TO REASON THEREALWAYS A FEWGRAINS OF COMMONSENSE IN AN OUNCE OF MISERLINESS. MISERLINESS IS ACAPITAL QUALITY TO RUN IN FAMILIES ITS THE SAFE SIDE FOR MADNESS TODIP ON. AND THERE MUST BE A LITTLE CRACK IN THE BROOKE FAMILY ELSE WESHOULD NOT SEE WHAT WE ARE TO SEE.WHAT BROOKE STANDING FOR MIDDLEMARCHWORSE THAN THAT. I REALLY FEEL A LITTLE RESPONSIBLE. I ALWAYS TOLD YOUMISS BROOKE WOULD BE SUCH A FINE MATCH. I KNEW THERE WAS A GREAT DEALOF NONSENSE IN HERA FLIGHTY SORT OF METHODISTICAL STUFF. BUT THESETHINGS WEAR OUT OF GIRLS. HOWEVER I AM TAKEN BY SURPRISE FOR ONCE.WHAT DO YOU MEAN MRS. CADWALLADER SAID SIR JAMES. HIS FEAR LESTMISS BROOKE SHOULD HAVE RUN AWAY TO JOIN THE MORAVIAN BRETHREN OR SOMEPREPOSTEROUS SECT UNKNOWN TO GOOD SOCIETY WAS A LITTLE ALLAYED BY THEKNOWLEDGE THAT MRS. CADWALLADER ALWAYS MADE THE WORST OF THINGS. WHATHAS HAPPENED TO MISS BROOKE PRAY SPEAK OUT.VERY WELL. SHE IS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED. MRS. CADWALLADER PAUSED AFEW MOMENTS OBSERVING THE DEEPLY HURT EXPRESSION IN HER FRIENDS FACEWHICH HE WAS TRYING TO CONCEAL BY A NERVOUS SMILE WHILE HE WHIPPED HISBOOT BUT SHE SOON ADDED ENGAGED TO CASAUBON.SIR JAMES LET HIS WHIP FALL AND STOOPED TO PICK IT UP. PERHAPS HIS FACEHAD NEVER BEFORE GATHERED SO MUCH CONCENTRATED DISGUST AS WHEN HETURNED TO MRS. CADWALLADER AND REPEATED CASAUBONEVEN SO. YOU KNOW MY ERRAND NOW.GOOD GOD IT IS HORRIBLE HE IS NO BETTER THAN A MUMMY THE POINT OFVIEW HAS TO BE ALLOWED FOR AS THAT OF A BLOOMING AND DISAPPOINTEDRIVAL.SHE SAYS HE IS A GREAT SOUL.A GREAT BLADDER FOR DRIED PEAS TO RATTLEIN SAID MRS. CADWALLADER.WHAT BUSINESS HAS AN OLD BACHELOR LIKE THAT TO MARRY SAID SIR JAMES.HE HAS ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE.HE MEANS TO DRAW IT OUT AGAIN I SUPPOSE.BROOKE OUGHT NOT TO ALLOW IT HE SHOULD INSIST ON ITS BEING PUT OFFTILL SHE IS OF AGE. SHE WOULD THINK BETTER OF IT THEN. WHAT IS AGUARDIAN FORAS IF YOU COULD EVER SQUEEZE A RESOLUTION OUT OF BROOKECADWALLADER MIGHT TALK TO HIM.NOT HE HUMPHREY FINDS EVERYBODY CHARMING. I NEVER CAN GET HIM TOABUSE CASAUBON. HE WILL EVEN SPEAK WELL OF THE BISHOP THOUGH I TELLHIM IT IS UNNATURAL IN A BENEFICED CLERGYMAN WHAT CAN ONE DO WITH AHUSBAND WHO ATTENDS SO LITTLE TO THE DECENCIES I HIDE IT AS WELL AS ICAN BY ABUSING EVERYBODY MYSELF. COME COME CHEER UP YOU ARE WELL RIDOF MISS BROOKE A GIRL WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRING YOU TO SEE THESTARS BY DAYLIGHT. BETWEEN OURSELVES LITTLE CELIA IS WORTH TWO OF HERAND LIKELY AFTER ALL TO BE THE BETTER MATCH. FOR THIS MARRIAGE TOCASAUBON IS AS GOOD AS GOING TO A NUNNERY.OH ON MY OWN ACCOUNTIT IS FOR MISS BROOKES SAKE I THINK HER FRIENDSSHOULD TRY TO USE THEIR INFLUENCE.WELL HUMPHREY DOESNT KNOW YET. BUT WHEN I TELL HIM YOU MAY DEPENDON IT HE WILL SAY WHY NOT CASAUBON IS A GOOD FELLOWAND YOUNGYOUNGENOUGH. THESE CHARITABLE PEOPLE NEVER KNOW VINEGAR FROM WINE TILL THEYHAVE SWALLOWED IT AND GOT THE COLIC. HOWEVER IF I WERE A MAN I SHOULDPREFER CELIA ESPECIALLY WHEN DOROTHEA WAS GONE. THE TRUTH IS YOU HAVEBEEN COURTING ONE AND HAVE WON THE OTHER. I CAN SEE THAT SHE ADMIRESYOU ALMOST AS MUCH AS A MAN EXPECTS TO BE ADMIRED. IF IT WERE ANY ONEBUT ME WHO SAID SO YOU MIGHT THINK IT EXAGGERATION. GOODBYSIR JAMES HANDED MRS. CADWALLADER TO THE PHAETON AND THEN JUMPED ONHIS HORSE. HE WAS NOT GOING TO RENOUNCE HIS RIDE BECAUSE OF HISFRIENDS UNPLEASANT NEWSONLY TO RIDE THE FASTER IN SOME OTHERDIRECTION THAN THAT OF TIPTON GRANGE.NOW WHY ON EARTH SHOULD MRS. CADWALLADER HAVE BEEN AT ALL BUSY ABOUTMISS BROOKES MARRIAGE AND WHY WHEN ONE MATCH THAT SHE LIKED TO THINKSHE HAD A HAND IN WAS FRUSTRATED SHOULD SHE HAVE STRAIGHTWAY CONTRIVEDTHE PRELIMINARIES OF ANOTHER WAS THERE ANY INGENIOUS PLOT ANYHIDEANDSEEK COURSE OF ACTION WHICH MIGHT BE DETECTED BY A CAREFULTELESCOPIC WATCH NOT AT ALL A TELESCOPE MIGHT HAVE SWEPT THE PARISHESOF TIPTON AND FRESHITT THE WHOLE AREA VISITED BY MRS. CADWALLADER INHER PHAETON WITHOUT WITNESSING ANY INTERVIEW THAT COULD EXCITESUSPICION OR ANY SCENE FROM WHICH SHE DID NOT RETURN WITH THE SAMEUNPERTURBED KEENNESS OF EYE AND THE SAME HIGH NATURAL COLOR. IN FACTIF THAT CONVENIENT VEHICLE HAD EXISTED IN THE DAYS OF THE SEVEN SAGESONE OF THEM WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE REMARKED THAT YOU CAN KNOW LITTLE OFWOMEN BY FOLLOWING THEM ABOUT IN THEIR PONYPHAETONS. EVEN WITH AMICROSCOPE DIRECTED ON A WATERDROP WE FIND OURSELVES MAKINGINTERPRETATIONS WHICH TURN OUT TO BE RATHER COARSE FOR WHEREAS UNDER AWEAK LENS YOU MAY SEEM TO SEE A CREATURE EXHIBITING AN ACTIVE VORACITYINTO WHICH OTHER SMALLER CREATURES ACTIVELY PLAY AS IF THEY WERE SOMANY ANIMATED TAXPENNIES A STRONGER LENS REVEALS TO YOU CERTAINTINIEST HAIRLETS WHICH MAKE VORTICES FOR THESE VICTIMS WHILE THESWALLOWER WAITS PASSIVELY AT HIS RECEIPT OF CUSTOM. IN THIS WAYMETAPHORICALLY SPEAKING A STRONG LENS APPLIED TO MRS. CADWALLADERSMATCHMAKING WILL SHOW A PLAY OF MINUTE CAUSES PRODUCING WHAT MAY BECALLED THOUGHT AND SPEECH VORTICES TO BRING HER THE SORT OF FOOD SHENEEDED. HER LIFE WAS RURALLY SIMPLE QUITE FREE FROM SECRETS EITHERFOUL DANGEROUS OR OTHERWISE IMPORTANT AND NOT CONSCIOUSLY AFFECTEDBY THE GREAT AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD. ALL THE MORE DID THE AFFAIRS OF THEGREAT WORLD INTEREST HER WHEN COMMUNICATED IN THE LETTERS OF HIGHBORNRELATIONS THE WAY IN WHICH FASCINATING YOUNGER SONS HAD GONE TO THEDOGS BY MARRYING THEIR MISTRESSES THE FINE OLDBLOODED IDIOCY OF YOUNGLORD TAPIR AND THE FURIOUS GOUTY HUMORS OF OLD LORD MEGATHERIUM THEEXACT CROSSING OF GENEALOGIES WHICH HAD BROUGHT A CORONET INTO A NEWBRANCH AND WIDENED THE RELATIONS OF SCANDALTHESE WERE TOPICS OF WHICHSHE RETAINED DETAILS WITH THE UTMOST ACCURACY AND REPRODUCED THEM INAN EXCELLENT PICKLE OF EPIGRAMS WHICH SHE HERSELF ENJOYED THE MOREBECAUSE SHE BELIEVED AS UNQUESTIONABLY IN BIRTH AND NOBIRTH AS SHE DIDIN GAME AND VERMIN. SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE DISOWNED ANY ONE ON THE GROUNDOF POVERTY A DE BRACY REDUCED TO TAKE HIS DINNER IN A BASIN WOULD HAVESEEMED TO HER AN EXAMPLE OF PATHOS WORTH EXAGGERATING AND I FEAR HISARISTOCRATIC VICES WOULD NOT HAVE HORRIFIED HER. BUT HER FEELINGTOWARDS THE VULGAR RICH WAS A SORT OF RELIGIOUS HATRED THEY HADPROBABLY MADE ALL THEIR MONEY OUT OF HIGH RETAIL PRICES AND MRS.CADWALLADER DETESTED HIGH PRICES FOR EVERYTHING THAT WAS NOT PAID INKIND AT THE RECTORY SUCH PEOPLE WERE NO PART OF GODS DESIGN IN MAKINGTHE WORLD AND THEIR ACCENT WAS AN AFFLICTION TO THE EARS. A TOWN WHERESUCH MONSTERS ABOUNDED WAS HARDLY MORE THAN A SORT OF LOW COMEDY WHICHCOULD NOT BE TAKEN ACCOUNT OF IN A WELLBRED SCHEME OF THE UNIVERSE.LET ANY LADY WHO IS INCLINED TO BE HARD ON MRS. CADWALLADER INQUIREINTO THE COMPREHENSIVENESS OF HER OWN BEAUTIFUL VIEWS AND BE QUITESURE THAT THEY AFFORD ACCOMMODATION FOR ALL THE LIVES WHICH HAVE THEHONOR TO COEXIST WITH HERS.WITH SUCH A MIND ACTIVE AS PHOSPHORUS BITING EVERYTHING THAT CAMENEAR INTO THE FORM THAT SUITED IT HOW COULD MRS. CADWALLADER FEEL THATTHE MISS BROOKES AND THEIR MATRIMONIAL PROSPECTS WERE ALIEN TO HERESPECIALLY AS IT HAD BEEN THE HABIT OF YEARS FOR HER TO SCOLD MR.BROOKE WITH THE FRIENDLIEST FRANKNESS AND LET HIM KNOW IN CONFIDENCETHAT SHE THOUGHT HIM A POOR CREATURE. FROM THE FIRST ARRIVAL OF THEYOUNG LADIES IN TIPTON SHE HAD PREARRANGED DOROTHEAS MARRIAGE WITH SIRJAMES AND IF IT HAD TAKEN PLACE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE SURE THAT IT WASHER DOING THAT IT SHOULD NOT TAKE PLACE AFTER SHE HAD PRECONCEIVED ITCAUSED HER AN IRRITATION WHICH EVERY THINKER WILL SYMPATHIZE WITH. SHEWAS THE DIPLOMATIST OF TIPTON AND FRESHITT AND FOR ANYTHING TO HAPPENIN SPITE OF HER WAS AN OFFENSIVE IRREGULARITY. AS TO FREAKS LIKE THISOF MISS BROOKES MRS. CADWALLADER HAD NO PATIENCE WITH THEM AND NOWSAW THAT HER OPINION OF THIS GIRL HAD BEEN INFECTED WITH SOME OF HERHUSBANDS WEAK CHARITABLENESS THOSE METHODISTICAL WHIMS THAT AIR OFBEING MORE RELIGIOUS THAN THE RECTOR AND CURATE TOGETHER CAME FROM ADEEPER AND MORE CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASE THAN SHE HAD BEEN WILLING TOBELIEVE.HOWEVER SAID MRS. CADWALLADER FIRST TO HERSELF AND AFTERWARDS TOHER HUSBAND I THROW HER OVER THERE WAS A CHANCE IF SHE HAD MARRIEDSIR JAMES OF HER BECOMING A SANE SENSIBLE WOMAN. HE WOULD NEVER HAVECONTRADICTED HER AND WHEN A WOMAN IS NOT CONTRADICTED SHE HAS NOMOTIVE FOR OBSTINACY IN HER ABSURDITIES. BUT NOW I WISH HER JOY OF HERHAIR SHIRT.IT FOLLOWED THAT MRS. CADWALLADER MUST DECIDE ON ANOTHER MATCH FOR SIRJAMES AND HAVING MADE UP HER MIND THAT IT WAS TO BE THE YOUNGER MISSBROOKE THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A MORE SKILFUL MOVE TOWARDS THESUCCESS OF HER PLAN THAN HER HINT TO THE BARONET THAT HE HAD MADE ANIMPRESSION ON CELIAS HEART. FOR HE WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE GENTLEMEN WHOLANGUISH AFTER THE UNATTAINABLE SAPPHOS APPLE THAT LAUGHS FROM THETOPMOST BOUGHTHE CHARMS WHICHSMILE LIKE THE KNOT OF COWSLIPS ON THE CLIFFNOT TO BE COME AT BY THE WILLING HAND.HE HAD NO SONNETS TO WRITE AND IT COULD NOT STRIKE HIM AGREEABLY THATHE WAS NOT AN OBJECT OF PREFERENCE TO THE WOMAN WHOM HE HAD PREFERRED.ALREADY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT DOROTHEA HAD CHOSEN MR. CASAUBON HAD BRUISEDHIS ATTACHMENT AND RELAXED ITS HOLD. ALTHOUGH SIR JAMES WAS ASPORTSMAN HE HAD SOME OTHER FEELINGS TOWARDS WOMEN THAN TOWARDS GROUSEAND FOXES AND DID NOT REGARD HIS FUTURE WIFE IN THE LIGHT OF PREYVALUABLE CHIEFLY FOR THE EXCITEMENTS OF THE CHASE. NEITHER WAS HE SOWELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE HABITS OF PRIMITIVE RACES AS TO FEEL THAT ANIDEAL COMBAT FOR HER TOMAHAWK IN HAND SO TO SPEAK WAS NECESSARY TOTHE HISTORICAL CONTINUITY OF THE MARRIAGETIE. ON THE CONTRARY HAVINGTHE AMIABLE VANITY WHICH KNITS US TO THOSE WHO ARE FOND OF US ANDDISINCLINES US TO THOSE WHO ARE INDIFFERENT AND ALSO A GOOD GRATEFULNATURE THE MERE IDEA THAT A WOMAN HAD A KINDNESS TOWARDS HIM SPUNLITTLE THREADS OF TENDERNESS FROM OUT HIS HEART TOWARDS HERS.THUS IT HAPPENED THAT AFTER SIR JAMES HAD RIDDEN RATHER FAST FOR HALFAN HOUR IN A DIRECTION AWAY FROM TIPTON GRANGE HE SLACKENED HIS PACEAND AT LAST TURNED INTO A ROAD WHICH WOULD LEAD HIM BACK BY A SHORTERCUT. VARIOUS FEELINGS WROUGHT IN HIM THE DETERMINATION AFTER ALL TO GOTO THE GRANGE TODAY AS IF NOTHING NEW HAD HAPPENED. HE COULD NOT HELPREJOICING THAT HE HAD NEVER MADE THE OFFER AND BEEN REJECTED MEREFRIENDLY POLITENESS REQUIRED THAT HE SHOULD CALL TO SEE DOROTHEA ABOUTTHE COTTAGES AND NOW HAPPILY MRS. CADWALLADER HAD PREPARED HIM TOOFFER HIS CONGRATULATIONS IF NECESSARY WITHOUT SHOWING TOO MUCHAWKWARDNESS. HE REALLY DID NOT LIKE IT GIVING UP DOROTHEA WAS VERYPAINFUL TO HIM BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE RESOLVE TO MAKE THISVISIT FORTHWITH AND CONQUER ALL SHOW OF FEELING WHICH WAS A SORT OFFILEBITING AND COUNTERIRRITANT. AND WITHOUT HIS DISTINCTLYRECOGNIZING THE IMPULSE THERE CERTAINLY WAS PRESENT IN HIM THE SENSETHAT CELIA WOULD BE THERE AND THAT HE SHOULD PAY HER MORE ATTENTIONTHAN HE HAD DONE BEFORE.WE MORTALS MEN AND WOMEN DEVOUR MANY A DISAPPOINTMENT BETWEENBREAKFAST AND DINNERTIME KEEP BACK THE TEARS AND LOOK A LITTLE PALEABOUT THE LIPS AND IN ANSWER TO INQUIRIES SAY OH NOTHING PRIDEHELPS US AND PRIDE IS NOT A BAD THING WHEN IT ONLY URGES US TO HIDEOUR OWN HURTSNOT TO HURT OTHERS.CHAPTER VII.PIACER E POPONEVUOL LA SUA STAGIONE.ITALIAN PROVERB.MR. CASAUBON AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF HIS TIME ATTHE GRANGE IN THESE WEEKS AND THE HINDRANCE WHICH COURTSHIP OCCASIONEDTO THE PROGRESS OF HIS GREAT WORKTHE KEY TO ALL MYTHOLOGIESNATURALLYMADE HIM LOOK FORWARD THE MORE EAGERLY TO THE HAPPY TERMINATION OFCOURTSHIP. BUT HE HAD DELIBERATELY INCURRED THE HINDRANCE HAVING MADEUP HIS MIND THAT IT WAS NOW TIME FOR HIM TO ADORN HIS LIFE WITH THEGRACES OF FEMALE COMPANIONSHIP TO IRRADIATE THE GLOOM WHICH FATIGUEWAS APT TO HANG OVER THE INTERVALS OF STUDIOUS LABOR WITH THE PLAY OFFEMALE FANCY AND TO SECURE IN THIS HIS CULMINATING AGE THE SOLACE OFFEMALE TENDANCE FOR HIS DECLINING YEARS. HENCE HE DETERMINED TO ABANDONHIMSELF TO THE STREAM OF FEELING AND PERHAPS WAS SURPRISED TO FINDWHAT AN EXCEEDINGLY SHALLOW RILL IT WAS. AS IN DROUGHTY REGIONS BAPTISMBY IMMERSION COULD ONLY BE PERFORMED SYMBOLICALLY MR. CASAUBON FOUNDTHAT SPRINKLING WAS THE UTMOST APPROACH TO A PLUNGE WHICH HIS STREAMWOULD AFFORD HIM AND HE CONCLUDED THAT THE POETS HAD MUCH EXAGGERATEDTHE FORCE OF MASCULINE PASSION. NEVERTHELESS HE OBSERVED WITH PLEASURETHAT MISS BROOKE SHOWED AN ARDENT SUBMISSIVE AFFECTION WHICH PROMISEDTO FULFIL HIS MOST AGREEABLE PREVISIONS OF MARRIAGE. IT HAD ONCE ORTWICE CROSSED HIS MIND THAT POSSIBLY THERE WAS SOME DEFICIENCY INDOROTHEA TO ACCOUNT FOR THE MODERATION OF HIS ABANDONMENT BUT HE WASUNABLE TO DISCERN THE DEFICIENCY OR TO FIGURE TO HIMSELF A WOMAN WHOWOULD HAVE PLEASED HIM BETTER SO THAT THERE WAS CLEARLY NO REASON TOFALL BACK UPON BUT THE EXAGGERATIONS OF HUMAN TRADITION.COULD I NOT BE PREPARING MYSELF NOW TO BE MORE USEFUL SAID DOROTHEATO HIM ONE MORNING EARLY IN THE TIME OF COURTSHIP COULD I NOT LEARNTO READ LATIN AND GREEK ALOUD TO YOU AS MILTONS DAUGHTERS DID TOTHEIR FATHER WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY READI FEAR THAT WOULD BE WEARISOME TO YOU SAID MR. CASAUBON SMILINGAND INDEED IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY THE YOUNG WOMEN YOU HAVE MENTIONEDREGARDED THAT EXERCISE IN UNKNOWN TONGUES AS A GROUND FOR REBELLIONAGAINST THE POET.YES BUT IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY WERE VERY NAUGHTY GIRLS ELSE THEYWOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD TO MINISTER TO SUCH A FATHER AND IN THE SECONDPLACE THEY MIGHT HAVE STUDIED PRIVATELY AND TAUGHT THEMSELVES TOUNDERSTAND WHAT THEY READ AND THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTING. IHOPE YOU DONT EXPECT ME TO BE NAUGHTY AND STUPIDI EXPECT YOU TO BE ALL THAT AN EXQUISITE YOUNG LADY CAN BE IN EVERYPOSSIBLE RELATION OF LIFE. CERTAINLY IT MIGHT BE A GREAT ADVANTAGE IFYOU WERE ABLE TO COPY THE GREEK CHARACTER AND TO THAT END IT WERE WELLTO BEGIN WITH A LITTLE READING.DOROTHEA SEIZED THIS AS A PRECIOUS PERMISSION. SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ASKEDMR. CASAUBON AT ONCE TO TEACH HER THE LANGUAGES DREADING OF ALL THINGSTO BE TIRESOME INSTEAD OF HELPFUL BUT IT WAS NOT ENTIRELY OUT OFDEVOTION TO HER FUTURE HUSBAND THAT SHE WISHED TO KNOW LATIN AND GREEK.THOSE PROVINCES OF MASCULINE KNOWLEDGE SEEMED TO HER A STANDINGGROUNDFROM WHICH ALL TRUTH COULD BE SEEN MORE TRULY. AS IT WAS SHECONSTANTLY DOUBTED HER OWN CONCLUSIONS BECAUSE SHE FELT HER OWNIGNORANCE HOW COULD SHE BE CONFIDENT THAT ONEROOMED COTTAGES WERE NOTFOR THE GLORY OF GOD WHEN MEN WHO KNEW THE CLASSICS APPEARED TOCONCILIATE INDIFFERENCE TO THE COTTAGES WITH ZEAL FOR THE GLORYPERHAPS EVEN HEBREW MIGHT BE NECESSARYAT LEAST THE ALPHABET AND A FEWROOTSIN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT THE CORE OF THINGS AND JUDGE SOUNDLY ONTHE SOCIAL DUTIES OF THE CHRISTIAN. AND SHE HAD NOT REACHED THAT POINTOF RENUNCIATION AT WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN SATISFIED WITH HAVING AWISE HUSBAND SHE WISHED POOR CHILD TO BE WISE HERSELF. MISS BROOKEWAS CERTAINLY VERY NAIVE WITH ALL HER ALLEGED CLEVERNESS. CELIA WHOSEMIND HAD NEVER BEEN THOUGHT TOO POWERFUL SAW THE EMPTINESS OF OTHERPEOPLES PRETENSIONS MUCH MORE READILY. TO HAVE IN GENERAL BUT LITTLEFEELING SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY SECURITY AGAINST FEELING TOO MUCH ON ANYPARTICULAR OCCASION.HOWEVER MR. CASAUBON CONSENTED TO LISTEN AND TEACH FOR AN HOURTOGETHER LIKE A SCHOOLMASTER OF LITTLE BOYS OR RATHER LIKE A LOVERTO WHOM A MISTRESSS ELEMENTARY IGNORANCE AND DIFFICULTIES HAVE ATOUCHING FITNESS. FEW SCHOLARS WOULD HAVE DISLIKED TEACHING THEALPHABET UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT DOROTHEA HERSELF WAS A LITTLESHOCKED AND DISCOURAGED AT HER OWN STUPIDITY AND THE ANSWERS SHE GOTTO SOME TIMID QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE GREEK ACCENTS GAVE HER APAINFUL SUSPICION THAT HERE INDEED THERE MIGHT BE SECRETS NOT CAPABLEOF EXPLANATION TO A WOMANS REASON.MR. BROOKE HAD NO DOUBT ON THAT POINT AND EXPRESSED HIMSELF WITH HISUSUAL STRENGTH UPON IT ONE DAY THAT HE CAME INTO THE LIBRARY WHILE THEREADING WAS GOING FORWARD.WELL BUT NOW CASAUBON SUCH DEEP STUDIES CLASSICS MATHEMATICSTHAT KIND OF THING ARE TOO TAXING FOR A WOMANTOO TAXING YOU KNOW.DOROTHEA IS LEARNING TO READ THE CHARACTERS SIMPLY SAID MR.CASAUBON EVADING THE QUESTION. SHE HAD THE VERY CONSIDERATE THOUGHTOF SAVING MY EYES.AH WELL WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOWTHAT MAY NOT BE SO BAD. BUTTHERE IS A LIGHTNESS ABOUT THE FEMININE MINDA TOUCH AND GOMUSIC THEFINE ARTS THAT KIND OF THINGTHEY SHOULD STUDY THOSE UP TO A CERTAINPOINT WOMEN SHOULD BUT IN A LIGHT WAY YOU KNOW. A WOMAN SHOULD BEABLE TO SIT DOWN AND PLAY YOU OR SING YOU A GOOD OLD ENGLISH TUNE. THATIS WHAT I LIKE THOUGH I HAVE HEARD MOST THINGSBEEN AT THE OPERA INVIENNA GLUCK MOZART EVERYTHING OF THAT SORT. BUT IM A CONSERVATIVEIN MUSICITS NOT LIKE IDEAS YOU KNOW. I STICK TO THE GOOD OLD TUNES.MR. CASAUBON IS NOT FOND OF THE PIANO AND I AM VERY GLAD HE IS NOTSAID DOROTHEA WHOSE SLIGHT REGARD FOR DOMESTIC MUSIC AND FEMININE FINEART MUST BE FORGIVEN HER CONSIDERING THE SMALL TINKLING AND SMEARINGIN WHICH THEY CHIEFLY CONSISTED AT THAT DARK PERIOD. SHE SMILED ANDLOOKED UP AT HER BETROTHED WITH GRATEFUL EYES. IF HE HAD ALWAYS BEENASKING HER TO PLAY THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER SHE WOULD HAVE REQUIREDMUCH RESIGNATION. HE SAYS THERE IS ONLY AN OLD HARPSICHORD AT LOWICKAND IT IS COVERED WITH BOOKS.AH THERE YOU ARE BEHIND CELIA MY DEAR. CELIA NOW PLAYS VERYPRETTILY AND IS ALWAYS READY TO PLAY. HOWEVER SINCE CASAUBON DOES NOTLIKE IT YOU ARE ALL RIGHT. BUT ITS A PITY YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE LITTLERECREATIONS OF THAT SORT CASAUBON THE BOW ALWAYS STRUNGTHAT KIND OFTHING YOU KNOWWILL NOT DO.I NEVER COULD LOOK ON IT IN THE LIGHT OF A RECREATION TO HAVE MY EARSTEASED WITH MEASURED NOISES SAID MR. CASAUBON. A TUNE MUCH ITERATEDHAS THE RIDICULOUS EFFECT OF MAKING THE WORDS IN MY MIND PERFORM A SORTOF MINUET TO KEEP TIMEAN EFFECT HARDLY TOLERABLE I IMAGINE AFTERBOYHOOD. AS TO THE GRANDER FORMS OF MUSIC WORTHY TO ACCOMPANY SOLEMNCELEBRATIONS AND EVEN TO SERVE AS AN EDUCATING INFLUENCE ACCORDING TOTHE ANCIENT CONCEPTION I SAY NOTHING FOR WITH THESE WE ARE NOTIMMEDIATELY CONCERNED.NO BUT MUSIC OF THAT SORT I SHOULD ENJOY SAID DOROTHEA. WHEN WEWERE COMING HOME FROM LAUSANNE MY UNCLE TOOK US TO HEAR THE GREAT ORGANAT FREIBERG AND IT MADE ME SOB.THAT KIND OF THING IS NOT HEALTHY MY DEAR SAID MR. BROOKE.CASAUBON SHE WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS NOW YOU MUST TEACH MY NIECE TOTAKE THINGS MORE QUIETLY EH DOROTHEAHE ENDED WITH A SMILE NOT WISHING TO HURT HIS NIECE BUT REALLYTHINKING THAT IT WAS PERHAPS BETTER FOR HER TO BE EARLY MARRIED TO SOSOBER A FELLOW AS CASAUBON SINCE SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF CHETTAM.IT IS WONDERFUL THOUGH HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE SHUFFLED OUT OF THEROOMIT IS WONDERFUL THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE LIKED HIM. HOWEVER THEMATCH IS GOOD. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TRAVELLING OUT OF MY BRIEF TO HAVEHINDERED IT LET MRS. CADWALLADER SAY WHAT SHE WILL. HE IS PRETTYCERTAIN TO BE A BISHOP IS CASAUBON. THAT WAS A VERY SEASONABLEPAMPHLET OF HIS ON THE CATHOLIC QUESTIONA DEANERY AT LEAST. THEY OWEHIM A DEANERY.AND HERE I MUST VINDICATE A CLAIM TO PHILOSOPHICAL REFLECTIVENESS BYREMARKING THAT MR. BROOKE ON THIS OCCASION LITTLE THOUGHT OF THERADICAL SPEECH WHICH AT A LATER PERIOD HE WAS LED TO MAKE ON THEINCOMES OF THE BISHOPS. WHAT ELEGANT HISTORIAN WOULD NEGLECT A STRIKINGOPPORTUNITY FOR POINTING OUT THAT HIS HEROES DID NOT FORESEE THEHISTORY OF THE WORLD OR EVEN THEIR OWN ACTIONSFOR EXAMPLE THATHENRY OF NAVARRE WHEN A PROTESTANT BABY LITTLE THOUGHT OF BEING ACATHOLIC MONARCH OR THAT ALFRED THE GREAT WHEN HE MEASURED HISLABORIOUS NIGHTS WITH BURNING CANDLES HAD NO IDEA OF FUTURE GENTLEMENMEASURING THEIR IDLE DAYS WITH WATCHES. HERE IS A MINE OF TRUTH WHICHHOWEVER VIGOROUSLY IT MAY BE WORKED IS LIKELY TO OUTLAST OUR COAL.BUT OF MR. BROOKE I MAKE A FURTHER REMARK PERHAPS LESS WARRANTED BYPRECEDENTNAMELY THAT IF HE HAD FOREKNOWN HIS SPEECH IT MIGHT NOTHAVE MADE ANY GREAT DIFFERENCE. TO THINK WITH PLEASURE OF HIS NIECESHUSBAND HAVING A LARGE ECCLESIASTICAL INCOME WAS ONE THINGTO MAKE ALIBERAL SPEECH WAS ANOTHER THING AND IT IS A NARROW MIND WHICH CANNOTLOOK AT A SUBJECT FROM VARIOUS POINTS OF VIEW.CHAPTER VIII.OH RESCUE HER I AM HER BROTHER NOWAND YOU HER FATHER. EVERY GENTLE MAIDSHOULD HAVE A GUARDIAN IN EACH GENTLEMAN.IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SIR JAMES CHETTAM HOW WELL HE CONTINUED TO LIKEGOING TO THE GRANGE AFTER HE HAD ONCE ENCOUNTERED THE DIFFICULTY OFSEEING DOROTHEA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE LIGHT OF A WOMAN WHO WASENGAGED TO ANOTHER MAN. OF COURSE THE FORKED LIGHTNING SEEMED TO PASSTHROUGH HIM WHEN HE FIRST APPROACHED HER AND HE REMAINED CONSCIOUSTHROUGHOUT THE INTERVIEW OF HIDING UNEASINESS BUT GOOD AS HE WAS ITMUST BE OWNED THAT HIS UNEASINESS WAS LESS THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IFHE HAD THOUGHT HIS RIVAL A BRILLIANT AND DESIRABLE MATCH. HE HAD NOSENSE OF BEING ECLIPSED BY MR. CASAUBON HE WAS ONLY SHOCKED THATDOROTHEA WAS UNDER A MELANCHOLY ILLUSION AND HIS MORTIFICATION LOSTSOME OF ITS BITTERNESS BY BEING MINGLED WITH COMPASSION.NEVERTHELESS WHILE SIR JAMES SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE HAD COMPLETELYRESIGNED HER SINCE WITH THE PERVERSITY OF A DESDEMONA SHE HAD NOTAFFECTED A PROPOSED MATCH THAT WAS CLEARLY SUITABLE AND ACCORDING TONATURE HE COULD NOT YET BE QUITE PASSIVE UNDER THE IDEA OF HERENGAGEMENT TO MR. CASAUBON. ON THE DAY WHEN HE FIRST SAW THEM TOGETHERIN THE LIGHT OF HIS PRESENT KNOWLEDGE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD NOTTAKEN THE AFFAIR SERIOUSLY ENOUGH. BROOKE WAS REALLY CULPABLE HE OUGHTTO HAVE HINDERED IT. WHO COULD SPEAK TO HIM SOMETHING MIGHT BE DONEPERHAPS EVEN NOW AT LEAST TO DEFER THE MARRIAGE. ON HIS WAY HOME HETURNED INTO THE RECTORY AND ASKED FOR MR. CADWALLADER. HAPPILY THERECTOR WAS AT HOME AND HIS VISITOR WAS SHOWN INTO THE STUDY WHERE ALLTHE FISHING TACKLE HUNG. BUT HE HIMSELF WAS IN A LITTLE ROOM ADJOININGAT WORK WITH HIS TURNING APPARATUS AND HE CALLED TO THE BARONET TOJOIN HIM THERE. THE TWO WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN ANY OTHER LANDHOLDERAND CLERGYMAN IN THE COUNTYA SIGNIFICANT FACT WHICH WAS IN AGREEMENTWITH THE AMIABLE EXPRESSION OF THEIR FACES.MR. CADWALLADER WAS A LARGE MAN WITH FULL LIPS AND A SWEET SMILE VERYPLAIN AND ROUGH IN HIS EXTERIOR BUT WITH THAT SOLID IMPERTURBABLE EASEAND GOODHUMOR WHICH IS INFECTIOUS AND LIKE GREAT GRASSY HILLS IN THESUNSHINE QUIETS EVEN AN IRRITATED EGOISM AND MAKES IT RATHER ASHAMEDOF ITSELF. WELL HOW ARE YOU HE SAID SHOWING A HAND NOT QUITE FITTO BE GRASPED. SORRY I MISSED YOU BEFORE. IS THERE ANYTHINGPARTICULAR YOU LOOK VEXED.SIR JAMESS BROW HAD A LITTLE CREASE IN IT A LITTLE DEPRESSION OF THEEYEBROW WHICH HE SEEMED PURPOSELY TO EXAGGERATE AS HE ANSWERED.IT IS ONLY THIS CONDUCT OF BROOKES. I REALLY THINK SOMEBODY SHOULDSPEAK TO HIM.WHAT MEANING TO STAND SAID MR. CADWALLADER GOING ON WITH THEARRANGEMENT OF THE REELS WHICH HE HAD JUST BEEN TURNING. I HARDLYTHINK HE MEANS IT. BUT WHERES THE HARM IF HE LIKES IT ANY ONE WHOOBJECTS TO WHIGGERY SHOULD BE GLAD WHEN THE WHIGS DONT PUT UP THESTRONGEST FELLOW. THEY WONT OVERTURN THE CONSTITUTION WITH OUR FRIENDBROOKES HEAD FOR A BATTERING RAM.OH I DONT MEAN THAT SAID SIR JAMES WHO AFTER PUTTING DOWN HISHAT AND THROWING HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR HAD BEGUN TO NURSE HIS LEG ANDEXAMINE THE SOLE OF HIS BOOT WITH MUCH BITTERNESS. I MEAN THISMARRIAGE. I MEAN HIS LETTING THAT BLOOMING YOUNG GIRL MARRY CASAUBON.WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH CASAUBON I SEE NO HARM IN HIMIF THE GIRLLIKES HIM.SHE IS TOO YOUNG TO KNOW WHAT SHE LIKES. HER GUARDIAN OUGHT TOINTERFERE. HE OUGHT NOT TO ALLOW THE THING TO BE DONE IN THIS HEADLONGMANNER. I WONDER A MAN LIKE YOU CADWALLADERA MAN WITH DAUGHTERS CANLOOK AT THE AFFAIR WITH INDIFFERENCE AND WITH SUCH A HEART AS YOURSDO THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT.I AM NOT JOKING I AM AS SERIOUS AS POSSIBLE SAID THE RECTOR WITH APROVOKING LITTLE INWARD LAUGH. YOU ARE AS BAD AS ELINOR. SHE HAS BEENWANTING ME TO GO AND LECTURE BROOKE AND I HAVE REMINDED HER THAT HERFRIENDS HAD A VERY POOR OPINION OF THE MATCH SHE MADE WHEN SHE MARRIEDME.BUT LOOK AT CASAUBON SAID SIR JAMES INDIGNANTLY. HE MUST BE FIFTYAND I DONT BELIEVE HE COULD EVER HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE THAN THE SHADOWOF A MAN. LOOK AT HIS LEGSCONFOUND YOU HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOWS YOU THINK OF HAVING IT ALL YOUROWN WAY IN THE WORLD. YOU DONT UNDERSTAND WOMEN. THEY DONT ADMIRE YOUHALF SO MUCH AS YOU ADMIRE YOURSELVES. ELINOR USED TO TELL HER SISTERSTHAT SHE MARRIED ME FOR MY UGLINESSIT WAS SO VARIOUS AND AMUSING THATIT HAD QUITE CONQUERED HER PRUDENCE.YOU IT WAS EASY ENOUGH FOR A WOMAN TO LOVE YOU. BUT THIS IS NOQUESTION OF BEAUTY. I DONT LIKE CASAUBON. THIS WAS SIR JAMESSSTRONGEST WAY OF IMPLYING THAT HE THOUGHT ILL OF A MANS CHARACTER.WHY WHAT DO YOU KNOW AGAINST HIM SAID THE RECTOR LAYING DOWN HISREELS AND PUTTING HIS THUMBS INTO HIS ARMHOLES WITH AN AIR OFATTENTION.SIR JAMES PAUSED. HE DID NOT USUALLY FIND IT EASY TO GIVE HIS REASONSIT SEEMED TO HIM STRANGE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT KNOW THEM WITHOUT BEINGTOLD SINCE HE ONLY FELT WHAT WAS REASONABLE. AT LAST HE SAIDNOW CADWALLADER HAS HE GOT ANY HEARTWELL YES. I DONT MEAN OF THE MELTING SORT BUT A SOUND KERNELTHAT YOU MAY BE SURE OF. HE IS VERY GOOD TO HIS POOR RELATIONSPENSIONS SEVERAL OF THE WOMEN AND IS EDUCATING A YOUNG FELLOW AT AGOOD DEAL OF EXPENSE. CASAUBON ACTS UP TO HIS SENSE OF JUSTICE. HISMOTHERS SISTER MADE A BAD MATCHA POLE I THINKLOST HERSELFAT ANYRATE WAS DISOWNED BY HER FAMILY. IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THAT CASAUBONWOULD NOT HAVE HAD SO MUCH MONEY BY HALF. I BELIEVE HE WENT HIMSELF TOFIND OUT HIS COUSINS AND SEE WHAT HE COULD DO FOR THEM. EVERY MANWOULD NOT RING SO WELL AS THAT IF YOU TRIED HIS METAL. YOU WOULDCHETTAM BUT NOT EVERY MAN.I DONT KNOW SAID SIR JAMES COLORING. I AM NOT SO SURE OF MYSELF.HE PAUSED A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED THAT WAS A RIGHT THING FORCASAUBON TO DO. BUT A MAN MAY WISH TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT AND YET BE ASORT OF PARCHMENT CODE. A WOMAN MAY NOT BE HAPPY WITH HIM. AND I THINKWHEN A GIRL IS SO YOUNG AS MISS BROOKE IS HER FRIENDS OUGHT TOINTERFERE A LITTLE TO HINDER HER FROM DOING ANYTHING FOOLISH. YOULAUGH BECAUSE YOU FANCY I HAVE SOME FEELING ON MY OWN ACCOUNT. BUTUPON MY HONOR IT IS NOT THAT. I SHOULD FEEL JUST THE SAME IF I WEREMISS BROOKES BROTHER OR UNCLE.WELL BUT WHAT SHOULD YOU DOI SHOULD SAY THAT THE MARRIAGE MUST NOT BE DECIDED ON UNTIL SHE WAS OFAGE. AND DEPEND UPON IT IN THAT CASE IT WOULD NEVER COME OFF. I WISHYOU SAW IT AS I DOI WISH YOU WOULD TALK TO BROOKE ABOUT IT.SIR JAMES ROSE AS HE WAS FINISHING HIS SENTENCE FOR HE SAW MRS.CADWALLADER ENTERING FROM THE STUDY. SHE HELD BY THE HAND HER YOUNGESTGIRL ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD WHO IMMEDIATELY RAN TO PAPA AND WAS MADECOMFORTABLE ON HIS KNEE.I HEAR WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SAID THE WIFE. BUT YOU WILL MAKENO IMPRESSION ON HUMPHREY. AS LONG AS THE FISH RISE TO HIS BAITEVERYBODY IS WHAT HE OUGHT TO BE. BLESS YOU CASAUBON HAS GOT ATROUTSTREAM AND DOES NOT CARE ABOUT FISHING IN IT HIMSELF COULDTHERE BE A BETTER FELLOWWELL THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT SAID THE RECTOR WITH HIS QUIETINWARD LAUGH. IT IS A VERY GOOD QUALITY IN A MAN TO HAVE ATROUTSTREAM.BUT SERIOUSLY SAID SIR JAMES WHOSE VEXATION HAD NOT YET SPENTITSELF DONT YOU THINK THE RECTOR MIGHT DO SOME GOOD BY SPEAKINGOH I TOLD YOU BEFOREHAND WHAT HE WOULD SAY ANSWERED MRS.CADWALLADER LIFTING UP HER EYEBROWS. I HAVE DONE WHAT I COULD I WASHMY HANDS OF THE MARRIAGE.IN THE FIRST PLACE SAID THE RECTOR LOOKING RATHER GRAVE IT WOULDBE NONSENSICAL TO EXPECT THAT I COULD CONVINCE BROOKE AND MAKE HIM ACTACCORDINGLY. BROOKE IS A VERY GOOD FELLOW BUT PULPY HE WILL RUN INTOANY MOULD BUT HE WONT KEEP SHAPE.HE MIGHT KEEP SHAPE LONG ENOUGH TO DEFER THE MARRIAGE SAID SIRJAMES.BUT MY DEAR CHETTAM WHY SHOULD I USE MY INFLUENCE TO CASAUBONSDISADVANTAGE UNLESS I WERE MUCH SURER THAN I AM THAT I SHOULD BEACTING FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF MISS BROOKE I KNOW NO HARM OF CASAUBON. IDONT CARE ABOUT HIS XISUTHRUS AND FEEFOFUM AND THE REST BUT THEN HEDOESNT CARE ABOUT MY FISHINGTACKLE. AS TO THE LINE HE TOOK ON THECATHOLIC QUESTION THAT WAS UNEXPECTED BUT HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN CIVIL TOME AND I DONT SEE WHY I SHOULD SPOIL HIS SPORT. FOR ANYTHING I CANTELL MISS BROOKE MAY BE HAPPIER WITH HIM THAN SHE WOULD BE WITH ANYOTHER MAN.HUMPHREY I HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH YOU. YOU KNOW YOU WOULD RATHER DINEUNDER THE HEDGE THAN WITH CASAUBON ALONE. YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TOEACH OTHER.WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH MISS BROOKES MARRYING HIM SHE DOES NOT DOIT FOR MY AMUSEMENT.HE HAS GOT NO GOOD RED BLOOD IN HIS BODY SAID SIR JAMES.NO. SOMEBODY PUT A DROP UNDER A MAGNIFYINGGLASS AND IT WAS ALLSEMICOLONS AND PARENTHESES SAID MRS. CADWALLADER.WHY DOES HE NOT BRING OUT HIS BOOK INSTEAD OF MARRYING SAID SIRJAMES WITH A DISGUST WHICH HE HELD WARRANTED BY THE SOUND FEELING OFAN ENGLISH LAYMAN.OH HE DREAMS FOOTNOTES AND THEY RUN AWAY WITH ALL HIS BRAINS. THEYSAY WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY HE MADE AN ABSTRACT OF HOP O MYTHUMB AND HE HAS BEEN MAKING ABSTRACTS EVER SINCE. UGH AND THAT ISTHE MAN HUMPHREY GOES ON SAYING THAT A WOMAN MAY BE HAPPY WITH.WELL HE IS WHAT MISS BROOKE LIKES SAID THE RECTOR. I DONT PROFESSTO UNDERSTAND EVERY YOUNG LADYS TASTE.BUT IF SHE WERE YOUR OWN DAUGHTER SAID SIR JAMES.THAT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT AFFAIR. SHE IS NOT MY DAUGHTER AND IDONT FEEL CALLED UPON TO INTERFERE. CASAUBON IS AS GOOD AS MOST OF US.HE IS A SCHOLARLY CLERGYMAN AND CREDITABLE TO THE CLOTH. SOME RADICALFELLOW SPEECHIFYING AT MIDDLEMARCH SAID CASAUBON WAS THE LEARNEDSTRAWCHOPPING INCUMBENT AND FREKE WAS THE BRICKANDMORTAR INCUMBENTAND I WAS THE ANGLING INCUMBENT. AND UPON MY WORD I DONT SEE THAT ONEIS WORSE OR BETTER THAN THE OTHER. THE RECTOR ENDED WITH HIS SILENTLAUGH. HE ALWAYS SAW THE JOKE OF ANY SATIRE AGAINST HIMSELF. HISCONSCIENCE WAS LARGE AND EASY LIKE THE REST OF HIM IT DID ONLY WHATIT COULD DO WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE.CLEARLY THERE WOULD BE NO INTERFERENCE WITH MISS BROOKES MARRIAGETHROUGH MR. CADWALLADER AND SIR JAMES FELT WITH SOME SADNESS THAT SHEWAS TO HAVE PERFECT LIBERTY OF MISJUDGMENT. IT WAS A SIGN OF HIS GOODDISPOSITION THAT HE DID NOT SLACKEN AT ALL IN HIS INTENTION OF CARRYINGOUT DOROTHEAS DESIGN OF THE COTTAGES. DOUBTLESS THIS PERSISTENCE WASTHE BEST COURSE FOR HIS OWN DIGNITY BUT PRIDE ONLY HELPS US TO BEGENEROUS IT NEVER MAKES US SO ANY MORE THAN VANITY MAKES US WITTY.SHE WAS NOW ENOUGH AWARE OF SIR JAMESS POSITION WITH REGARD TO HER TOAPPRECIATE THE RECTITUDE OF HIS PERSEVERANCE IN A LANDLORDS DUTY TOWHICH HE HAD AT FIRST BEEN URGED BY A LOVERS COMPLAISANCE AND HERPLEASURE IN IT WAS GREAT ENOUGH TO COUNT FOR SOMETHING EVEN IN HERPRESENT HAPPINESS. PERHAPS SHE GAVE TO SIR JAMES CHETTAMS COTTAGES ALLTHE INTEREST SHE COULD SPARE FROM MR. CASAUBON OR RATHER FROM THESYMPHONY OF HOPEFUL DREAMS ADMIRING TRUST AND PASSIONATE SELFDEVOTION WHICH THAT LEARNED GENTLEMAN HAD SET PLAYING IN HER SOUL.HENCE IT HAPPENED THAT IN THE GOOD BARONETS SUCCEEDING VISITS WHILEHE WAS BEGINNING TO PAY SMALL ATTENTIONS TO CELIA HE FOUND HIMSELFTALKING WITH MORE AND MORE PLEASURE TO DOROTHEA. SHE WAS PERFECTLYUNCONSTRAINED AND WITHOUT IRRITATION TOWARDS HIM NOW AND HE WASGRADUALLY DISCOVERING THE DELIGHT THERE IS IN FRANK KINDNESS ANDCOMPANIONSHIP BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN WHO HAVE NO PASSION TO HIDE ORCONFESS.CHAPTER IX.ST GENT. AN ANCIENT LAND IN ANCIENT ORACLES    IS CALLED LAWTHIRSTY ALL THE STRUGGLE THERE    WAS AFTER ORDER AND A PERFECT RULE.    PRAY WHERE LIE SUCH LANDS NOW . . .D GENT. WHY WHERE THEY LAY OF OLDIN HUMAN SOULS.MR. CASAUBONS BEHAVIOR ABOUT SETTLEMENTS WAS HIGHLY SATISFACTORY TOMR. BROOKE AND THE PRELIMINARIES OF MARRIAGE ROLLED SMOOTHLY ALONGSHORTENING THE WEEKS OF COURTSHIP. THE BETROTHED BRIDE MUST SEE HERFUTURE HOME AND DICTATE ANY CHANGES THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MADETHERE. A WOMAN DICTATES BEFORE MARRIAGE IN ORDER THAT SHE MAY HAVE ANAPPETITE FOR SUBMISSION AFTERWARDS. AND CERTAINLY THE MISTAKES THAT WEMALE AND FEMALE MORTALS MAKE WHEN WE HAVE OUR OWN WAY MIGHT FAIRLYRAISE SOME WONDER THAT WE ARE SO FOND OF IT.ON A GRAY BUT DRY NOVEMBER MORNING DOROTHEA DROVE TO LOWICK IN COMPANYWITH HER UNCLE AND CELIA. MR. CASAUBONS HOME WAS THE MANORHOUSE.CLOSE BY VISIBLE FROM SOME PARTS OF THE GARDEN WAS THE LITTLE CHURCHWITH THE OLD PARSONAGE OPPOSITE. IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER MR.CASAUBON HAD ONLY HELD THE LIVING BUT THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER HAD PUTHIM IN POSSESSION OF THE MANOR ALSO. IT HAD A SMALL PARK WITH A FINEOLD OAK HERE AND THERE AND AN AVENUE OF LIMES TOWARDS THE SOUTHWESTFRONT WITH A SUNK FENCE BETWEEN PARK AND PLEASUREGROUND SO THAT FROMTHE DRAWINGROOM WINDOWS THE GLANCE SWEPT UNINTERRUPTEDLY ALONG A SLOPEOF GREENSWARD TILL THE LIMES ENDED IN A LEVEL OF CORN AND PASTURESWHICH OFTEN SEEMED TO MELT INTO A LAKE UNDER THE SETTING SUN. THIS WASTHE HAPPY SIDE OF THE HOUSE FOR THE SOUTH AND EAST LOOKED RATHERMELANCHOLY EVEN UNDER THE BRIGHTEST MORNING. THE GROUNDS HERE WERE MORECONFINED THE FLOWERBEDS SHOWED NO VERY CAREFUL TENDANCE AND LARGECLUMPS OF TREES CHIEFLY OF SOMBRE YEWS HAD RISEN HIGH NOT TEN YARDSFROM THE WINDOWS. THE BUILDING OF GREENISH STONE WAS IN THE OLDENGLISH STYLE NOT UGLY BUT SMALLWINDOWED AND MELANCHOLYLOOKING THESORT OF HOUSE THAT MUST HAVE CHILDREN MANY FLOWERS OPEN WINDOWS ANDLITTLE VISTAS OF BRIGHT THINGS TO MAKE IT SEEM A JOYOUS HOME. IN THISLATTER END OF AUTUMN WITH A SPARSE REMNANT OF YELLOW LEAVES FALLINGSLOWLY ATHWART THE DARK EVERGREENS IN A STILLNESS WITHOUT SUNSHINE THEHOUSE TOO HAD AN AIR OF AUTUMNAL DECLINE AND MR. CASAUBON WHEN HEPRESENTED HIMSELF HAD NO BLOOM THAT COULD BE THROWN INTO RELIEF BYTHAT BACKGROUND.OH DEAR CELIA SAID TO HERSELF I AM SURE FRESHITT HALL WOULD HAVEBEEN PLEASANTER THAN THIS. SHE THOUGHT OF THE WHITE FREESTONE THEPILLARED PORTICO AND THE TERRACE FULL OF FLOWERS SIR JAMES SMILINGABOVE THEM LIKE A PRINCE ISSUING FROM HIS ENCHANTMENT IN A ROSEBUSHWITH A HANDKERCHIEF SWIFTLY METAMORPHOSED FROM THE MOST DELICATELYODOROUS PETALSSIR JAMES WHO TALKED SO AGREEABLY ALWAYS ABOUT THINGSWHICH HAD COMMONSENSE IN THEM AND NOT ABOUT LEARNING CELIA HAD THOSELIGHT YOUNG FEMININE TASTES WHICH GRAVE AND WEATHERWORN GENTLEMENSOMETIMES PREFER IN A WIFE BUT HAPPILY MR. CASAUBONS BIAS HAD BEENDIFFERENT FOR HE WOULD HAVE HAD NO CHANCE WITH CELIA.DOROTHEA ON THE CONTRARY FOUND THE HOUSE AND GROUNDS ALL THAT SHECOULD WISH THE DARK BOOKSHELVES IN THE LONG LIBRARY THE CARPETS ANDCURTAINS WITH COLORS SUBDUED BY TIME THE CURIOUS OLD MAPS ANDBIRDSEYE VIEWS ON THE WALLS OF THE CORRIDOR WITH HERE AND THERE ANOLD VASE BELOW HAD NO OPPRESSION FOR HER AND SEEMED MORE CHEERFULTHAN THE CASTS AND PICTURES AT THE GRANGE WHICH HER UNCLE HAD LONG AGOBROUGHT HOME FROM HIS TRAVELSTHEY BEING PROBABLY AMONG THE IDEAS HEHAD TAKEN IN AT ONE TIME. TO POOR DOROTHEA THESE SEVERE CLASSICALNUDITIES AND SMIRKING RENAISSANCECORREGGIOSITIES WERE PAINFULLYINEXPLICABLE STARING INTO THE MIDST OF HER PURITANIC CONCEPTIONS SHEHAD NEVER BEEN TAUGHT HOW SHE COULD BRING THEM INTO ANY SORT OFRELEVANCE WITH HER LIFE. BUT THE OWNERS OF LOWICK APPARENTLY HAD NOTBEEN TRAVELLERS AND MR. CASAUBONS STUDIES OF THE PAST WERE NOTCARRIED ON BY MEANS OF SUCH AIDS.DOROTHEA WALKED ABOUT THE HOUSE WITH DELIGHTFUL EMOTION. EVERYTHINGSEEMED HALLOWED TO HER THIS WAS TO BE THE HOME OF HER WIFEHOOD ANDSHE LOOKED UP WITH EYES FULL OF CONFIDENCE TO MR. CASAUBON WHEN HE DREWHER ATTENTION SPECIALLY TO SOME ACTUAL ARRANGEMENT AND ASKED HER IF SHEWOULD LIKE AN ALTERATION. ALL APPEALS TO HER TASTE SHE MET GRATEFULLYBUT SAW NOTHING TO ALTER. HIS EFFORTS AT EXACT COURTESY AND FORMALTENDERNESS HAD NO DEFECT FOR HER. SHE FILLED UP ALL BLANKS WITHUNMANIFESTED PERFECTIONS INTERPRETING HIM AS SHE INTERPRETED THE WORKSOF PROVIDENCE AND ACCOUNTING FOR SEEMING DISCORDS BY HER OWN DEAFNESSTO THE HIGHER HARMONIES. AND THERE ARE MANY BLANKS LEFT IN THE WEEKS OFCOURTSHIP WHICH A LOVING FAITH FILLS WITH HAPPY ASSURANCE.NOW MY DEAR DOROTHEA I WISH YOU TO FAVOR ME BY POINTING OUT WHICHROOM YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AS YOUR BOUDOIR SAID MR. CASAUBONSHOWING THAT HIS VIEWS OF THE WOMANLY NATURE WERE SUFFICIENTLY LARGE TOINCLUDE THAT REQUIREMENT.IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU TO THINK OF THAT SAID DOROTHEA BUT I ASSUREYOU I WOULD RATHER HAVE ALL THOSE MATTERS DECIDED FOR ME. I SHALL BEMUCH HAPPIER TO TAKE EVERYTHING AS IT ISJUST AS YOU HAVE BEEN USED TOHAVE IT OR AS YOU WILL YOURSELF CHOOSE IT TO BE. I HAVE NO MOTIVE FORWISHING ANYTHING ELSE.OH DODO SAID CELIA WILL YOU NOT HAVE THE BOWWINDOWED ROOMUPSTAIRSMR. CASAUBON LED THE WAY THITHER. THE BOWWINDOW LOOKED DOWN THE AVENUEOF LIMES THE FURNITURE WAS ALL OF A FADED BLUE AND THERE WEREMINIATURES OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WITH POWDERED HAIR HANGING IN AGROUP. A PIECE OF TAPESTRY OVER A DOOR ALSO SHOWED A BLUEGREEN WORLDWITH A PALE STAG IN IT. THE CHAIRS AND TABLES WERE THINLEGGED AND EASYTO UPSET. IT WAS A ROOM WHERE ONE MIGHT FANCY THE GHOST OF ATIGHTLACED LADY REVISITING THE SCENE OF HER EMBROIDERY. A LIGHTBOOKCASE CONTAINED DUODECIMO VOLUMES OF POLITE LITERATURE IN CALFCOMPLETING THE FURNITURE.YES SAID MR. BROOKE THIS WOULD BE A PRETTY ROOM WITH SOME NEWHANGINGS SOFAS AND THAT SORT OF THING. A LITTLE BARE NOW.NO UNCLE SAID DOROTHEA EAGERLY. PRAY DO NOT SPEAK OF ALTERINGANYTHING. THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER THINGS IN THE WORLD THAT WANTALTERINGI LIKE TO TAKE THESE THINGS AS THEY ARE. AND YOU LIKE THEM ASTHEY ARE DONT YOU SHE ADDED LOOKING AT MR. CASAUBON. PERHAPS THISWAS YOUR MOTHERS ROOM WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG.IT WAS HE SAID WITH HIS SLOW BEND OF THE HEAD.THIS IS YOUR MOTHER SAID DOROTHEA WHO HAD TURNED TO EXAMINE THEGROUP OF MINIATURES. IT IS LIKE THE TINY ONE YOU BROUGHT ME ONLY ISHOULD THINK A BETTER PORTRAIT. AND THIS ONE OPPOSITE WHO IS THISHER ELDER SISTER. THEY WERE LIKE YOU AND YOUR SISTER THE ONLY TWOCHILDREN OF THEIR PARENTS WHO HANG ABOVE THEM YOU SEE.THE SISTER IS PRETTY SAID CELIA IMPLYING THAT SHE THOUGHT LESSFAVORABLY OF MR. CASAUBONS MOTHER. IT WAS A NEW OPENING TO CELIASIMAGINATION THAT HE CAME OF A FAMILY WHO HAD ALL BEEN YOUNG IN THEIRTIMETHE LADIES WEARING NECKLACES.IT IS A PECULIAR FACE SAID DOROTHEA LOOKING CLOSELY. THOSE DEEPGRAY EYES RATHER NEAR TOGETHERAND THE DELICATE IRREGULAR NOSE WITH ASORT OF RIPPLE IN ITAND ALL THE POWDERED CURLS HANGING BACKWARD.ALTOGETHER IT SEEMS TO ME PECULIAR RATHER THAN PRETTY. THERE IS NOTEVEN A FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND YOUR MOTHER.NO. AND THEY WERE NOT ALIKE IN THEIR LOT.YOU DID NOT MENTION HER TO ME SAID DOROTHEA.MY AUNT MADE AN UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE. I NEVER SAW HER.DOROTHEA WONDERED A LITTLE BUT FELT THAT IT WOULD BE INDELICATE JUSTTHEN TO ASK FOR ANY INFORMATION WHICH MR. CASAUBON DID NOT PROFFER ANDSHE TURNED TO THE WINDOW TO ADMIRE THE VIEW. THE SUN HAD LATELY PIERCEDTHE GRAY AND THE AVENUE OF LIMES CAST SHADOWS.SHALL WE NOT WALK IN THE GARDEN NOW SAID DOROTHEA.AND YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CHURCH YOU KNOW SAID MR. BROOKE. ITIS A DROLL LITTLE CHURCH. AND THE VILLAGE. IT ALL LIES IN A NUTSHELL.BY THE WAY IT WILL SUIT YOU DOROTHEA FOR THE COTTAGES ARE LIKE A ROWOF ALMSHOUSESLITTLE GARDENS GILLYFLOWERS THAT SORT OF THING.YES PLEASE SAID DOROTHEA LOOKING AT MR. CASAUBON I SHOULD LIKETO SEE ALL THAT. SHE HAD GOT NOTHING FROM HIM MORE GRAPHIC ABOUT THELOWICK COTTAGES THAN THAT THEY WERE NOT BAD.THEY WERE SOON ON A GRAVEL WALK WHICH LED CHIEFLY BETWEEN GRASSYBORDERS AND CLUMPS OF TREES THIS BEING THE NEAREST WAY TO THE CHURCHMR. CASAUBON SAID. AT THE LITTLE GATE LEADING INTO THE CHURCHYARD THEREWAS A PAUSE WHILE MR. CASAUBON WENT TO THE PARSONAGE CLOSE BY TO FETCHA KEY. CELIA WHO HAD BEEN HANGING A LITTLE IN THE REAR CAME UPPRESENTLY WHEN SHE SAW THAT MR. CASAUBON WAS GONE AWAY AND SAID INHER EASY STACCATO WHICH ALWAYS SEEMED TO CONTRADICT THE SUSPICION OFANY MALICIOUS INTENTDO YOU KNOW DOROTHEA I SAW SOME ONE QUITE YOUNG COMING UP ONE OF THEWALKS.IS THAT ASTONISHING CELIATHERE MAY BE A YOUNG GARDENER YOU KNOWWHY NOT SAID MR. BROOKE. ITOLD CASAUBON HE SHOULD CHANGE HIS GARDENER.NO NOT A GARDENER SAID CELIA A GENTLEMAN WITH A SKETCHBOOK. HEHAD LIGHTBROWN CURLS. I ONLY SAW HIS BACK. BUT HE WAS QUITE YOUNG.THE CURATES SON PERHAPS SAID MR. BROOKE. AH THERE IS CASAUBONAGAIN AND TUCKER WITH HIM. HE IS GOING TO INTRODUCE TUCKER. YOU DONTKNOW TUCKER YET.MR. TUCKER WAS THE MIDDLEAGED CURATE ONE OF THE INFERIOR CLERGYWHO ARE USUALLY NOT WANTING IN SONS. BUT AFTER THE INTRODUCTION THECONVERSATION DID NOT LEAD TO ANY QUESTION ABOUT HIS FAMILY AND THESTARTLING APPARITION OF YOUTHFULNESS WAS FORGOTTEN BY EVERY ONE BUTCELIA. SHE INWARDLY DECLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE LIGHTBROWN CURLS ANDSLIM FIGURE COULD HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP TO MR. TUCKER WHO WAS JUST ASOLD AND MUSTYLOOKING AS SHE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED MR. CASAUBONS CURATETO BE DOUBTLESS AN EXCELLENT MAN WHO WOULD GO TO HEAVEN FOR CELIAWISHED NOT TO BE UNPRINCIPLED BUT THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH WERE SOUNPLEASANT. CELIA THOUGHT WITH SOME DISMALNESS OF THE TIME SHE SHOULDHAVE TO SPEND AS BRIDESMAID AT LOWICK WHILE THE CURATE HAD PROBABLY NOPRETTY LITTLE CHILDREN WHOM SHE COULD LIKE IRRESPECTIVE OF PRINCIPLE.MR. TUCKER WAS INVALUABLE IN THEIR WALK AND PERHAPS MR. CASAUBON HADNOT BEEN WITHOUT FORESIGHT ON THIS HEAD THE CURATE BEING ABLE TOANSWER ALL DOROTHEAS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VILLAGERS AND THE OTHERPARISHIONERS. EVERYBODY HE ASSURED HER WAS WELL OFF IN LOWICK NOT ACOTTAGER IN THOSE DOUBLE COTTAGES AT A LOW RENT BUT KEPT A PIG AND THESTRIPS OF GARDEN AT THE BACK WERE WELL TENDED. THE SMALL BOYS WOREEXCELLENT CORDUROY THE GIRLS WENT OUT AS TIDY SERVANTS OR DID ALITTLE STRAWPLAITING AT HOME NO LOOMS HERE NO DISSENT AND THOUGHTHE PUBLIC DISPOSITION WAS RATHER TOWARDS LAYING BY MONEY THAN TOWARDSSPIRITUALITY THERE WAS NOT MUCH VICE. THE SPECKLED FOWLS WERE SONUMEROUS THAT MR. BROOKE OBSERVED YOUR FARMERS LEAVE SOME BARLEY FORTHE WOMEN TO GLEAN I SEE. THE POOR FOLKS HERE MIGHT HAVE A FOWL INTHEIR POT AS THE GOOD FRENCH KING USED TO WISH FOR ALL HIS PEOPLE. THEFRENCH EAT A GOOD MANY FOWLSSKINNY FOWLS YOU KNOW.I THINK IT WAS A VERY CHEAP WISH OF HIS SAID DOROTHEA INDIGNANTLY.ARE KINGS SUCH MONSTERS THAT A WISH LIKE THAT MUST BE RECKONED A ROYALVIRTUEAND IF HE WISHED THEM A SKINNY FOWL SAID CELIA THAT WOULD NOT BENICE. BUT PERHAPS HE WISHED THEM TO HAVE FAT FOWLS.YES BUT THE WORD HAS DROPPED OUT OF THE TEXT OR PERHAPS WASSUBAUDITUM THAT IS PRESENT IN THE KINGS MIND BUT NOT UTTERED SAIDMR. CASAUBON SMILING AND BENDING HIS HEAD TOWARDS CELIA WHOIMMEDIATELY DROPPED BACKWARD A LITTLE BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT BEAR MR.CASAUBON TO BLINK AT HER.DOROTHEA SANK INTO SILENCE ON THE WAY BACK TO THE HOUSE. SHE FELT SOMEDISAPPOINTMENT OF WHICH SHE WAS YET ASHAMED THAT THERE WAS NOTHINGFOR HER TO DO IN LOWICK AND IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES HER MIND HADGLANCED OVER THE POSSIBILITY WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED OFFINDING THAT HER HOME WOULD BE IN A PARISH WHICH HAD A LARGER SHARE OFTHE WORLDS MISERY SO THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD MORE ACTIVE DUTIES INIT. THEN RECURRING TO THE FUTURE ACTUALLY BEFORE HER SHE MADE APICTURE OF MORE COMPLETE DEVOTION TO MR. CASAUBONS AIMS IN WHICH SHEWOULD AWAIT NEW DUTIES. MANY SUCH MIGHT REVEAL THEMSELVES TO THE HIGHERKNOWLEDGE GAINED BY HER IN THAT COMPANIONSHIP.MR. TUCKER SOON LEFT THEM HAVING SOME CLERICAL WORK WHICH WOULD NOTALLOW HIM TO LUNCH AT THE HALL AND AS THEY WERE REENTERING THE GARDENTHROUGH THE LITTLE GATE MR. CASAUBON SAIDYOU SEEM A LITTLE SAD DOROTHEA. I TRUST YOU ARE PLEASED WITH WHAT YOUHAVE SEEN.I AM FEELING SOMETHING WHICH IS PERHAPS FOOLISH AND WRONG ANSWEREDDOROTHEA WITH HER USUAL OPENNESSALMOST WISHING THAT THE PEOPLEWANTED MORE TO BE DONE FOR THEM HERE. I HAVE KNOWN SO FEW WAYS OFMAKING MY LIFE GOOD FOR ANYTHING. OF COURSE MY NOTIONS OF USEFULNESSMUST BE NARROW. I MUST LEARN NEW WAYS OF HELPING PEOPLE.DOUBTLESS SAID MR. CASAUBON. EACH POSITION HAS ITS CORRESPONDINGDUTIES. YOURS I TRUST AS THE MISTRESS OF LOWICK WILL NOT LEAVE ANYYEARNING UNFULFILLED.INDEED I BELIEVE THAT SAID DOROTHEA EARNESTLY. DO NOT SUPPOSETHAT I AM SAD.THAT IS WELL. BUT IF YOU ARE NOT TIRED WE WILL TAKE ANOTHER WAY TOTHE HOUSE THAN THAT BY WHICH WE CAME.DOROTHEA WAS NOT AT ALL TIRED AND A LITTLE CIRCUIT WAS MADE TOWARDS AFINE YEWTREE THE CHIEF HEREDITARY GLORY OF THE GROUNDS ON THIS SIDEOF THE HOUSE. AS THEY APPROACHED IT A FIGURE CONSPICUOUS ON A DARKBACKGROUND OF EVERGREENS WAS SEATED ON A BENCH SKETCHING THE OLDTREE. MR. BROOKE WHO WAS WALKING IN FRONT WITH CELIA TURNED HIS HEADAND SAIDWHO IS THAT YOUNGSTER CASAUBONTHEY HAD COME VERY NEAR WHEN MR. CASAUBON ANSWEREDTHAT IS A YOUNG RELATIVE OF MINE A SECOND COUSIN THE GRANDSON INFACT HE ADDED LOOKING AT DOROTHEA OF THE LADY WHOSE PORTRAIT YOUHAVE BEEN NOTICING MY AUNT JULIA.THE YOUNG MAN HAD LAID DOWN HIS SKETCHBOOK AND RISEN. HIS BUSHYLIGHTBROWN CURLS AS WELL AS HIS YOUTHFULNESS IDENTIFIED HIM AT ONCEWITH CELIAS APPARITION.DOROTHEA LET ME INTRODUCE TO YOU MY COUSIN MR. LADISLAW. WILL THISIS MISS BROOKE.THE COUSIN WAS SO CLOSE NOW THAT WHEN HE LIFTED HIS HAT DOROTHEACOULD SEE A PAIR OF GRAY EYES RATHER NEAR TOGETHER A DELICATEIRREGULAR NOSE WITH A LITTLE RIPPLE IN IT AND HAIR FALLING BACKWARDBUT THERE WAS A MOUTH AND CHIN OF A MORE PROMINENT THREATENING ASPECTTHAN BELONGED TO THE TYPE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS MINIATURE. YOUNGLADISLAW DID NOT FEEL IT NECESSARY TO SMILE AS IF HE WERE CHARMED WITHTHIS INTRODUCTION TO HIS FUTURE SECOND COUSIN AND HER RELATIVES BUTWORE RATHER A POUTING AIR OF DISCONTENT.YOU ARE AN ARTIST I SEE SAID MR. BROOKE TAKING UP THE SKETCHBOOKAND TURNING IT OVER IN HIS UNCEREMONIOUS FASHION.NO I ONLY SKETCH A LITTLE. THERE IS NOTHING FIT TO BE SEEN THERESAID YOUNG LADISLAW COLORING PERHAPS WITH TEMPER RATHER THAN MODESTY.OH COME THIS IS A NICE BIT NOW. I DID A LITTLE IN THIS WAY MYSELFAT ONE TIME YOU KNOW. LOOK HERE NOW THIS IS WHAT I CALL A NICETHING DONE WITH WHAT WE USED TO CALL BRIO. MR. BROOKE HELD OUTTOWARDS THE TWO GIRLS A LARGE COLORED SKETCH OF STONY GROUND AND TREESWITH A POOL.I AM NO JUDGE OF THESE THINGS SAID DOROTHEA NOT COLDLY BUT WITH ANEAGER DEPRECATION OF THE APPEAL TO HER. YOU KNOW UNCLE I NEVER SEETHE BEAUTY OF THOSE PICTURES WHICH YOU SAY ARE SO MUCH PRAISED. THEYARE A LANGUAGE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. I SUPPOSE THERE IS SOME RELATIONBETWEEN PICTURES AND NATURE WHICH I AM TOO IGNORANT TO FEELJUST AS YOUSEE WHAT A GREEK SENTENCE STANDS FOR WHICH MEANS NOTHING TO ME.DOROTHEA LOOKED UP AT MR. CASAUBON WHO BOWED HIS HEAD TOWARDS HERWHILE MR. BROOKE SAID SMILING NONCHALANTLYBLESS ME NOW HOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE ARE BUT YOU HAD A BAD STYLE OFTEACHING YOU KNOWELSE THIS IS JUST THE THING FOR GIRLSSKETCHINGFINE ART AND SO ON. BUT YOU TOOK TO DRAWING PLANS YOU DONT UNDERSTANDMORBIDEZZA AND THAT KIND OF THING. YOU WILL COME TO MY HOUSE IHOPE AND I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT I DID IN THIS WAY HE CONTINUEDTURNING TO YOUNG LADISLAW WHO HAD TO BE RECALLED FROM HISPREOCCUPATION IN OBSERVING DOROTHEA. LADISLAW HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THATSHE MUST BE AN UNPLEASANT GIRL SINCE SHE WAS GOING TO MARRY CASAUBONAND WHAT SHE SAID OF HER STUPIDITY ABOUT PICTURES WOULD HAVE CONFIRMEDTHAT OPINION EVEN IF HE HAD BELIEVED HER. AS IT WAS HE TOOK HER WORDSFOR A COVERT JUDGMENT AND WAS CERTAIN THAT SHE THOUGHT HIS SKETCHDETESTABLE. THERE WAS TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS IN HER APOLOGY SHE WASLAUGHING BOTH AT HER UNCLE AND HIMSELF. BUT WHAT A VOICE IT WAS LIKETHE VOICE OF A SOUL THAT HAD ONCE LIVED IN AN AEOLIAN HARP. THIS MUSTBE ONE OF NATURES INCONSISTENCIES. THERE COULD BE NO SORT OF PASSIONIN A GIRL WHO WOULD MARRY CASAUBON. BUT HE TURNED FROM HER AND BOWEDHIS THANKS FOR MR. BROOKES INVITATION.WE WILL TURN OVER MY ITALIAN ENGRAVINGS TOGETHER CONTINUED THATGOODNATURED MAN. I HAVE NO END OF THOSE THINGS THAT I HAVE LAID BYFOR YEARS. ONE GETS RUSTY IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW. NOTYOU CASAUBON YOU STICK TO YOUR STUDIES BUT MY BEST IDEAS GETUNDERMOSTOUT OF USE YOU KNOW. YOU CLEVER YOUNG MEN MUST GUARD AGAINSTINDOLENCE. I WAS TOO INDOLENT YOU KNOW ELSE I MIGHT HAVE BEENANYWHERE AT ONE TIME.THAT IS A SEASONABLE ADMONITION SAID MR. CASAUBON BUT NOW WE WILLPASS ON TO THE HOUSE LEST THE YOUNG LADIES SHOULD BE TIRED OFSTANDING.WHEN THEIR BACKS WERE TURNED YOUNG LADISLAW SAT DOWN TO GO ON WITH HISSKETCHING AND AS HE DID SO HIS FACE BROKE INTO AN EXPRESSION OFAMUSEMENT WHICH INCREASED AS HE WENT ON DRAWING TILL AT LAST HE THREWBACK HIS HEAD AND LAUGHED ALOUD. PARTLY IT WAS THE RECEPTION OF HIS OWNARTISTIC PRODUCTION THAT TICKLED HIM PARTLY THE NOTION OF HIS GRAVECOUSIN AS THE LOVER OF THAT GIRL AND PARTLY MR. BROOKES DEFINITION OFTHE PLACE HE MIGHT HAVE HELD BUT FOR THE IMPEDIMENT OF INDOLENCE. MR.WILL LADISLAWS SENSE OF THE LUDICROUS LIT UP HIS FEATURES VERYAGREEABLY IT WAS THE PURE ENJOYMENT OF COMICALITY AND HAD NO MIXTUREOF SNEERING AND SELFEXALTATION.WHAT IS YOUR NEPHEW GOING TO DO WITH HIMSELF CASAUBON SAID MR.BROOKE AS THEY WENT ON.MY COUSIN YOU MEANNOT MY NEPHEW.YES YES COUSIN. BUT IN THE WAY OF A CAREER YOU KNOW.THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS PAINFULLY DOUBTFUL. ON LEAVING RUGBY HEDECLINED TO GO TO AN ENGLISH UNIVERSITY WHERE I WOULD GLADLY HAVEPLACED HIM AND CHOSE WHAT I MUST CONSIDER THE ANOMALOUS COURSE OFSTUDYING AT HEIDELBERG. AND NOW HE WANTS TO GO ABROAD AGAIN WITHOUTANY SPECIAL OBJECT SAVE THE VAGUE PURPOSE OF WHAT HE CALLS CULTUREPREPARATION FOR HE KNOWS NOT WHAT. HE DECLINES TO CHOOSE A PROFESSION.HE HAS NO MEANS BUT WHAT YOU FURNISH I SUPPOSE.I HAVE ALWAYS GIVEN HIM AND HIS FRIENDS REASON TO UNDERSTAND THAT IWOULD FURNISH IN MODERATION WHAT WAS NECESSARY FOR PROVIDING HIM WITH ASCHOLARLY EDUCATION AND LAUNCHING HIM RESPECTABLY. I AM THEREFOREBOUND TO FULFIL THE EXPECTATION SO RAISED SAID MR. CASAUBON PUTTINGHIS CONDUCT IN THE LIGHT OF MERE RECTITUDE A TRAIT OF DELICACY WHICHDOROTHEA NOTICED WITH ADMIRATION.HE HAS A THIRST FOR TRAVELLING PERHAPS HE MAY TURN OUT A BRUCE OR AMUNGO PARK SAID MR. BROOKE. I HAD A NOTION OF THAT MYSELF AT ONETIME.NO HE HAS NO BENT TOWARDS EXPLORATION OR THE ENLARGEMENT OF OURGEOGNOSIS THAT WOULD BE A SPECIAL PURPOSE WHICH I COULD RECOGNIZE WITHSOME APPROBATION THOUGH WITHOUT FELICITATING HIM ON A CAREER WHICH SOOFTEN ENDS IN PREMATURE AND VIOLENT DEATH. BUT SO FAR IS HE FROM HAVINGANY DESIRE FOR A MORE ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE EARTHS SURFACE THATHE SAID HE SHOULD PREFER NOT TO KNOW THE SOURCES OF THE NILE AND THATTHERE SHOULD BE SOME UNKNOWN REGIONS PRESERVED AS HUNTING GROUNDS FORTHE POETIC IMAGINATION.WELL THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT YOU KNOW SAID MR. BROOKE WHO HADCERTAINLY AN IMPARTIAL MIND.IT IS I FEAR NOTHING MORE THAN A PART OF HIS GENERAL INACCURACY ANDINDISPOSITION TO THOROUGHNESS OF ALL KINDS WHICH WOULD BE A BAD AUGURYFOR HIM IN ANY PROFESSION CIVIL OR SACRED EVEN WERE HE SO FARSUBMISSIVE TO ORDINARY RULE AS TO CHOOSE ONE.PERHAPS HE HAS CONSCIENTIOUS SCRUPLES FOUNDED ON HIS OWN UNFITNESSSAID DOROTHEA WHO WAS INTERESTING HERSELF IN FINDING A FAVORABLEEXPLANATION. BECAUSE THE LAW AND MEDICINE SHOULD BE VERY SERIOUSPROFESSIONS TO UNDERTAKE SHOULD THEY NOT PEOPLES LIVES AND FORTUNESDEPEND ON THEM.DOUBTLESS BUT I FEAR THAT MY YOUNG RELATIVE WILL LADISLAW IS CHIEFLYDETERMINED IN HIS AVERSION TO THESE CALLINGS BY A DISLIKE TO STEADYAPPLICATION AND TO THAT KIND OF ACQUIREMENT WHICH IS NEEDFULINSTRUMENTALLY BUT IS NOT CHARMING OR IMMEDIATELY INVITING TOSELFINDULGENT TASTE. I HAVE INSISTED TO HIM ON WHAT ARISTOTLE HASSTATED WITH ADMIRABLE BREVITY THAT FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ANY WORKREGARDED AS AN END THERE MUST BE A PRIOR EXERCISE OF MANY ENERGIES ORACQUIRED FACILITIES OF A SECONDARY ORDER DEMANDING PATIENCE. I HAVEPOINTED TO MY OWN MANUSCRIPT VOLUMES WHICH REPRESENT THE TOIL OF YEARSPREPARATORY TO A WORK NOT YET ACCOMPLISHED. BUT IN VAIN. TO CAREFULREASONING OF THIS KIND HE REPLIES BY CALLING HIMSELF PEGASUS AND EVERYFORM OF PRESCRIBED WORK HARNESS.CELIA LAUGHED. SHE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT MR. CASAUBON COULD SAYSOMETHING QUITE AMUSING.WELL YOU KNOW HE MAY TURN OUT A BYRON A CHATTERTON ACHURCHILLTHAT SORT OF THINGTHERES NO TELLING SAID MR. BROOKE.SHALL YOU LET HIM GO TO ITALY OR WHEREVER ELSE HE WANTS TO GOYES I HAVE AGREED TO FURNISH HIM WITH MODERATE SUPPLIES FOR A YEAR ORSO HE ASKS NO MORE. I SHALL LET HIM BE TRIED BY THE TEST OF FREEDOM.THAT IS VERY KIND OF YOU SAID DOROTHEA LOOKING UP AT MR. CASAUBONWITH DELIGHT. IT IS NOBLE. AFTER ALL PEOPLE MAY REALLY HAVE IN THEMSOME VOCATION WHICH IS NOT QUITE PLAIN TO THEMSELVES MAY THEY NOTTHEY MAY SEEM IDLE AND WEAK BECAUSE THEY ARE GROWING. WE SHOULD BE VERYPATIENT WITH EACH OTHER I THINK.I SUPPOSE IT IS BEING ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED THAT HAS MADE YOU THINKPATIENCE GOOD SAID CELIA AS SOON AS SHE AND DOROTHEA WERE ALONETOGETHER TAKING OFF THEIR WRAPPINGS.YOU MEAN THAT I AM VERY IMPATIENT CELIA.YES WHEN PEOPLE DONT DO AND SAY JUST WHAT YOU LIKE. CELIA HADBECOME LESS AFRAID OF SAYING THINGS TO DOROTHEA SINCE THISENGAGEMENT CLEVERNESS SEEMED TO HER MORE PITIABLE THAN EVER.CHAPTER X.HE HAD CATCHED A GREAT COLD HAD HE HAD NO OTHER CLOTHES TO WEAR THANTHE SKIN OF A BEAR NOT YET KILLED.FULLER.YOUNG LADISLAW DID NOT PAY THAT VISIT TO WHICH MR. BROOKE HAD INVITEDHIM AND ONLY SIX DAYS AFTERWARDS MR. CASAUBON MENTIONED THAT HIS YOUNGRELATIVE HAD STARTED FOR THE CONTINENT SEEMING BY THIS COLD VAGUENESSTO WAIVE INQUIRY. INDEED WILL HAD DECLINED TO FIX ON ANY MORE PRECISEDESTINATION THAN THE ENTIRE AREA OF EUROPE. GENIUS HE HELD ISNECESSARILY INTOLERANT OF FETTERS ON THE ONE HAND IT MUST HAVE THEUTMOST PLAY FOR ITS SPONTANEITY ON THE OTHER IT MAY CONFIDENTLY AWAITTHOSE MESSAGES FROM THE UNIVERSE WHICH SUMMON IT TO ITS PECULIAR WORKONLY PLACING ITSELF IN AN ATTITUDE OF RECEPTIVITY TOWARDS ALL SUBLIMECHANCES. THE ATTITUDES OF RECEPTIVITY ARE VARIOUS AND WILL HADSINCERELY TRIED MANY OF THEM. HE WAS NOT EXCESSIVELY FOND OF WINE BUTHE HAD SEVERAL TIMES TAKEN TOO MUCH SIMPLY AS AN EXPERIMENT IN THATFORM OF ECSTASY HE HAD FASTED TILL HE WAS FAINT AND THEN SUPPED ONLOBSTER HE HAD MADE HIMSELF ILL WITH DOSES OF OPIUM. NOTHING GREATLYORIGINAL HAD RESULTED FROM THESE MEASURES AND THE EFFECTS OF THE OPIUMHAD CONVINCED HIM THAT THERE WAS AN ENTIRE DISSIMILARITY BETWEEN HISCONSTITUTION AND DE QUINCEYS. THE SUPERADDED CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH WOULDEVOLVE THE GENIUS HAD NOT YET COME THE UNIVERSE HAD NOT YET BECKONED.EVEN CAESARS FORTUNE AT ONE TIME WAS BUT A GRAND PRESENTIMENT. WE KNOWWHAT A MASQUERADE ALL DEVELOPMENT IS AND WHAT EFFECTIVE SHAPES MAY BEDISGUISED IN HELPLESS EMBRYOS. IN FACT THE WORLD IS FULL OF HOPEFULANALOGIES AND HANDSOME DUBIOUS EGGS CALLED POSSIBILITIES. WILL SAWCLEARLY ENOUGH THE PITIABLE INSTANCES OF LONG INCUBATION PRODUCING NOCHICK AND BUT FOR GRATITUDE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT CASAUBON WHOSEPLODDING APPLICATION ROWS OF NOTEBOOKS AND SMALL TAPER OF LEARNEDTHEORY EXPLORING THE TOSSED RUINS OF THE WORLD SEEMED TO ENFORCE AMORAL ENTIRELY ENCOURAGING TO WILLS GENEROUS RELIANCE ON THEINTENTIONS OF THE UNIVERSE WITH REGARD TO HIMSELF. HE HELD THATRELIANCE TO BE A MARK OF GENIUS AND CERTAINLY IT IS NO MARK TO THECONTRARY GENIUS CONSISTING NEITHER IN SELFCONCEIT NOR IN HUMILITYBUT IN A POWER TO MAKE OR DO NOT ANYTHING IN GENERAL BUT SOMETHING INPARTICULAR. LET HIM START FOR THE CONTINENT THEN WITHOUT OURPRONOUNCING ON HIS FUTURE. AMONG ALL FORMS OF MISTAKE PROPHECY IS THEMOST GRATUITOUS.BUT AT PRESENT THIS CAUTION AGAINST A TOO HASTY JUDGMENT INTERESTS MEMORE IN RELATION TO MR. CASAUBON THAN TO HIS YOUNG COUSIN. IF TODOROTHEA MR. CASAUBON HAD BEEN THE MERE OCCASION WHICH HAD SET ALIGHTTHE FINE INFLAMMABLE MATERIAL OF HER YOUTHFUL ILLUSIONS DOES IT FOLLOWTHAT HE WAS FAIRLY REPRESENTED IN THE MINDS OF THOSE LESS IMPASSIONEDPERSONAGES WHO HAVE HITHERTO DELIVERED THEIR JUDGMENTS CONCERNING HIMI PROTEST AGAINST ANY ABSOLUTE CONCLUSION ANY PREJUDICE DERIVED FROMMRS. CADWALLADERS CONTEMPT FOR A NEIGHBORING CLERGYMANS ALLEGEDGREATNESS OF SOUL OR SIR JAMES CHETTAMS POOR OPINION OF HIS RIVALSLEGSFROM MR. BROOKES FAILURE TO ELICIT A COMPANIONS IDEAS OR FROMCELIAS CRITICISM OF A MIDDLEAGED SCHOLARS PERSONAL APPEARANCE. I AMNOT SURE THAT THE GREATEST MAN OF HIS AGE IF EVER THAT SOLITARYSUPERLATIVE EXISTED COULD ESCAPE THESE UNFAVORABLE REFLECTIONS OFHIMSELF IN VARIOUS SMALL MIRRORS AND EVEN MILTON LOOKING FOR HISPORTRAIT IN A SPOON MUST SUBMIT TO HAVE THE FACIAL ANGLE OF A BUMPKIN.MOREOVER IF MR. CASAUBON SPEAKING FOR HIMSELF HAS RATHER A CHILLINGRHETORIC IT IS NOT THEREFORE CERTAIN THAT THERE IS NO GOOD WORK ORFINE FEELING IN HIM. DID NOT AN IMMORTAL PHYSICIST AND INTERPRETER OFHIEROGLYPHS WRITE DETESTABLE VERSES HAS THE THEORY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEMBEEN ADVANCED BY GRACEFUL MANNERS AND CONVERSATIONAL TACT SUPPOSE WETURN FROM OUTSIDE ESTIMATES OF A MAN TO WONDER WITH KEENER INTERESTWHAT IS THE REPORT OF HIS OWN CONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT HIS DOINGS ORCAPACITY WITH WHAT HINDRANCES HE IS CARRYING ON HIS DAILY LABORS WHATFADING OF HOPES OR WHAT DEEPER FIXITY OF SELFDELUSION THE YEARS AREMARKING OFF WITHIN HIM AND WITH WHAT SPIRIT HE WRESTLES AGAINSTUNIVERSAL PRESSURE WHICH WILL ONE DAY BE TOO HEAVY FOR HIM AND BRINGHIS HEART TO ITS FINAL PAUSE. DOUBTLESS HIS LOT IS IMPORTANT IN HIS OWNEYES AND THE CHIEF REASON THAT WE THINK HE ASKS TOO LARGE A PLACE INOUR CONSIDERATION MUST BE OUR WANT OF ROOM FOR HIM SINCE WE REFER HIMTO THE DIVINE REGARD WITH PERFECT CONFIDENCE NAY IT IS EVEN HELDSUBLIME FOR OUR NEIGHBOR TO EXPECT THE UTMOST THERE HOWEVER LITTLE HEMAY HAVE GOT FROM US. MR. CASAUBON TOO WAS THE CENTRE OF HIS OWNWORLD IF HE WAS LIABLE TO THINK THAT OTHERS WERE PROVIDENTIALLY MADEFOR HIM AND ESPECIALLY TO CONSIDER THEM IN THE LIGHT OF THEIR FITNESSFOR THE AUTHOR OF A KEY TO ALL MYTHOLOGIES THIS TRAIT IS NOT QUITEALIEN TO US AND LIKE THE OTHER MENDICANT HOPES OF MORTALS CLAIMSSOME OF OUR PITY.CERTAINLY THIS AFFAIR OF HIS MARRIAGE WITH MISS BROOKE TOUCHED HIM MORENEARLY THAN IT DID ANY ONE OF THE PERSONS WHO HAVE HITHERTO SHOWN THEIRDISAPPROVAL OF IT AND IN THE PRESENT STAGE OF THINGS I FEEL MORETENDERLY TOWARDS HIS EXPERIENCE OF SUCCESS THAN TOWARDS THEDISAPPOINTMENT OF THE AMIABLE SIR JAMES. FOR IN TRUTH AS THE DAY FIXEDFOR HIS MARRIAGE CAME NEARER MR. CASAUBON DID NOT FIND HIS SPIRITSRISING NOR DID THE CONTEMPLATION OF THAT MATRIMONIAL GARDEN SCENEWHERE AS ALL EXPERIENCE SHOWED THE PATH WAS TO BE BORDERED WITHFLOWERS PROVE PERSISTENTLY MORE ENCHANTING TO HIM THAN THE ACCUSTOMEDVAULTS WHERE HE WALKED TAPER IN HAND. HE DID NOT CONFESS TO HIMSELFSTILL LESS COULD HE HAVE BREATHED TO ANOTHER HIS SURPRISE THAT THOUGHHE HAD WON A LOVELY AND NOBLEHEARTED GIRL HE HAD NOT WONDELIGHTWHICH HE HAD ALSO REGARDED AS AN OBJECT TO BE FOUND BY SEARCH.IT IS TRUE THAT HE KNEW ALL THE CLASSICAL PASSAGES IMPLYING THECONTRARY BUT KNOWING CLASSICAL PASSAGES WE FIND IS A MODE OF MOTIONWHICH EXPLAINS WHY THEY LEAVE SO LITTLE EXTRA FORCE FOR THEIR PERSONALAPPLICATION.POOR MR. CASAUBON HAD IMAGINED THAT HIS LONG STUDIOUS BACHELORHOOD HADSTORED UP FOR HIM A COMPOUND INTEREST OF ENJOYMENT AND THAT LARGEDRAFTS ON HIS AFFECTIONS WOULD NOT FAIL TO BE HONORED FOR WE ALL OFUS GRAVE OR LIGHT GET OUR THOUGHTS ENTANGLED IN METAPHORS AND ACTFATALLY ON THE STRENGTH OF THEM. AND NOW HE WAS IN DANGER OF BEINGSADDENED BY THE VERY CONVICTION THAT HIS CIRCUMSTANCES WERE UNUSUALLYHAPPY THERE WAS NOTHING EXTERNAL BY WHICH HE COULD ACCOUNT FOR ACERTAIN BLANKNESS OF SENSIBILITY WHICH CAME OVER HIM JUST WHEN HISEXPECTANT GLADNESS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MOST LIVELY JUST WHEN HE EXCHANGEDTHE ACCUSTOMED DULNESS OF HIS LOWICK LIBRARY FOR HIS VISITS TO THEGRANGE. HERE WAS A WEARY EXPERIENCE IN WHICH HE WAS AS UTTERLYCONDEMNED TO LONELINESS AS IN THE DESPAIR WHICH SOMETIMES THREATENEDHIM WHILE TOILING IN THE MORASS OF AUTHORSHIP WITHOUT SEEMING NEARER TOTHE GOAL. AND HIS WAS THAT WORST LONELINESS WHICH WOULD SHRINK FROMSYMPATHY. HE COULD NOT BUT WISH THAT DOROTHEA SHOULD THINK HIM NOT LESSHAPPY THAN THE WORLD WOULD EXPECT HER SUCCESSFUL SUITOR TO BE AND INRELATION TO HIS AUTHORSHIP HE LEANED ON HER YOUNG TRUST AND VENERATIONHE LIKED TO DRAW FORTH HER FRESH INTEREST IN LISTENING AS A MEANS OFENCOURAGEMENT TO HIMSELF IN TALKING TO HER HE PRESENTED ALL HISPERFORMANCE AND INTENTION WITH THE REFLECTED CONFIDENCE OF THEPEDAGOGUE AND RID HIMSELF FOR THE TIME OF THAT CHILLING IDEAL AUDIENCEWHICH CROWDED HIS LABORIOUS UNCREATIVE HOURS WITH THE VAPOROUS PRESSUREOF TARTAREAN SHADES.FOR TO DOROTHEA AFTER THAT TOYBOX HISTORY OF THE WORLD ADAPTED TOYOUNG LADIES WHICH HAD MADE THE CHIEF PART OF HER EDUCATION MR.CASAUBONS TALK ABOUT HIS GREAT BOOK WAS FULL OF NEW VISTAS AND THISSENSE OF REVELATION THIS SURPRISE OF A NEARER INTRODUCTION TO STOICSAND ALEXANDRIANS AS PEOPLE WHO HAD IDEAS NOT TOTALLY UNLIKE HER OWNKEPT IN ABEYANCE FOR THE TIME HER USUAL EAGERNESS FOR A BINDING THEORYWHICH COULD BRING HER OWN LIFE AND DOCTRINE INTO STRICT CONNECTION WITHTHAT AMAZING PAST AND GIVE THE REMOTEST SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE SOMEBEARING ON HER ACTIONS. THAT MORE COMPLETE TEACHING WOULD COMEMR.CASAUBON WOULD TELL HER ALL THAT SHE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO HIGHERINITIATION IN IDEAS AS SHE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO MARRIAGE ANDBLENDING HER DIM CONCEPTIONS OF BOTH. IT WOULD BE A GREAT MISTAKE TOSUPPOSE THAT DOROTHEA WOULD HAVE CARED ABOUT ANY SHARE IN MR.CASAUBONS LEARNING AS MERE ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR THOUGH OPINION IN THENEIGHBORHOOD OF FRESHITT AND TIPTON HAD PRONOUNCED HER CLEVER THATEPITHET WOULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED HER TO CIRCLES IN WHOSE MORE PRECISEVOCABULARY CLEVERNESS IMPLIES MERE APTITUDE FOR KNOWING AND DOINGAPART FROM CHARACTER. ALL HER EAGERNESS FOR ACQUIREMENT LAY WITHIN THATFULL CURRENT OF SYMPATHETIC MOTIVE IN WHICH HER IDEAS AND IMPULSES WEREHABITUALLY SWEPT ALONG. SHE DID NOT WANT TO DECK HERSELF WITHKNOWLEDGETO WEAR IT LOOSE FROM THE NERVES AND BLOOD THAT FED HERACTION AND IF SHE HAD WRITTEN A BOOK SHE MUST HAVE DONE IT AS SAINTTHERESA DID UNDER THE COMMAND OF AN AUTHORITY THAT CONSTRAINED HERCONSCIENCE. BUT SOMETHING SHE YEARNED FOR BY WHICH HER LIFE MIGHT BEFILLED WITH ACTION AT ONCE RATIONAL AND ARDENT AND SINCE THE TIME WASGONE BY FOR GUIDING VISIONS AND SPIRITUAL DIRECTORS SINCE PRAYERHEIGHTENED YEARNING BUT NOT INSTRUCTION WHAT LAMP WAS THERE BUTKNOWLEDGE SURELY LEARNED MEN KEPT THE ONLY OIL AND WHO MORE LEARNEDTHAN MR. CASAUBONTHUS IN THESE BRIEF WEEKS DOROTHEAS JOYOUS GRATEFUL EXPECTATION WASUNBROKEN AND HOWEVER HER LOVER MIGHT OCCASIONALLY BE CONSCIOUS OFFLATNESS HE COULD NEVER REFER IT TO ANY SLACKENING OF HER AFFECTIONATEINTEREST.THE SEASON WAS MILD ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE THE PROJECT OF EXTENDING THEWEDDING JOURNEY AS FAR AS ROME AND MR. CASAUBON WAS ANXIOUS FOR THISBECAUSE HE WISHED TO INSPECT SOME MANUSCRIPTS IN THE VATICAN.I STILL REGRET THAT YOUR SISTER IS NOT TO ACCOMPANY US HE SAID ONEMORNING SOME TIME AFTER IT HAD BEEN ASCERTAINED THAT CELIA OBJECTED TOGO AND THAT DOROTHEA DID NOT WISH FOR HER COMPANIONSHIP. YOU WILLHAVE MANY LONELY HOURS DOROTHEA FOR I SHALL BE CONSTRAINED TO MAKETHE UTMOST USE OF MY TIME DURING OUR STAY IN ROME AND I SHOULD FEELMORE AT LIBERTY IF YOU HAD A COMPANION.THE WORDS I SHOULD FEEL MORE AT LIBERTY GRATED ON DOROTHEA. FOR THEFIRST TIME IN SPEAKING TO MR. CASAUBON SHE COLORED FROM ANNOYANCE.YOU MUST HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD ME VERY MUCH SHE SAID IF YOU THINK ISHOULD NOT ENTER INTO THE VALUE OF YOUR TIMEIF YOU THINK THAT I SHOULDNOT WILLINGLY GIVE UP WHATEVER INTERFERED WITH YOUR USING IT TO THEBEST PURPOSE.THAT IS VERY AMIABLE IN YOU MY DEAR DOROTHEA SAID MR. CASAUBON NOTIN THE LEAST NOTICING THAT SHE WAS HURT BUT IF YOU HAD A LADY AS YOURCOMPANION I COULD PUT YOU BOTH UNDER THE CARE OF A CICERONE AND WECOULD THUS ACHIEVE TWO PURPOSES IN THE SAME SPACE OF TIME.I BEG YOU WILL NOT REFER TO THIS AGAIN SAID DOROTHEA RATHERHAUGHTILY. BUT IMMEDIATELY SHE FEARED THAT SHE WAS WRONG AND TURNINGTOWARDS HIM SHE LAID HER HAND ON HIS ADDING IN A DIFFERENT TONE PRAYDO NOT BE ANXIOUS ABOUT ME. I SHALL HAVE SO MUCH TO THINK OF WHEN I AMALONE. AND TANTRIPP WILL BE A SUFFICIENT COMPANION JUST TO TAKE CAREOF ME. I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE CELIA SHE WOULD BE MISERABLE.IT WAS TIME TO DRESS. THERE WAS TO BE A DINNERPARTY THAT DAY THE LASTOF THE PARTIES WHICH WERE HELD AT THE GRANGE AS PROPER PRELIMINARIES TOTHE WEDDING AND DOROTHEA WAS GLAD OF A REASON FOR MOVING AWAY AT ONCEON THE SOUND OF THE BELL AS IF SHE NEEDED MORE THAN HER USUAL AMOUNTOF PREPARATION. SHE WAS ASHAMED OF BEING IRRITATED FROM SOME CAUSE SHECOULD NOT DEFINE EVEN TO HERSELF FOR THOUGH SHE HAD NO INTENTION TO BEUNTRUTHFUL HER REPLY HAD NOT TOUCHED THE REAL HURT WITHIN HER. MR.CASAUBONS WORDS HAD BEEN QUITE REASONABLE YET THEY HAD BROUGHT AVAGUE INSTANTANEOUS SENSE OF ALOOFNESS ON HIS PART.SURELY I AM IN A STRANGELY SELFISH WEAK STATE OF MIND SHE SAID TOHERSELF. HOW CAN I HAVE A HUSBAND WHO IS SO MUCH ABOVE ME WITHOUTKNOWING THAT HE NEEDS ME LESS THAN I NEED HIMHAVING CONVINCED HERSELF THAT MR. CASAUBON WAS ALTOGETHER RIGHT SHERECOVERED HER EQUANIMITY AND WAS AN AGREEABLE IMAGE OF SERENE DIGNITYWHEN SHE CAME INTO THE DRAWINGROOM IN HER SILVERGRAY DRESSTHE SIMPLELINES OF HER DARKBROWN HAIR PARTED OVER HER BROW AND COILED MASSIVELYBEHIND IN KEEPING WITH THE ENTIRE ABSENCE FROM HER MANNER ANDEXPRESSION OF ALL SEARCH AFTER MERE EFFECT. SOMETIMES WHEN DOROTHEA WASIN COMPANY THERE SEEMED TO BE AS COMPLETE AN AIR OF REPOSE ABOUT HERAS IF SHE HAD BEEN A PICTURE OF SANTA BARBARA LOOKING OUT FROM HERTOWER INTO THE CLEAR AIR BUT THESE INTERVALS OF QUIETUDE MADE THEENERGY OF HER SPEECH AND EMOTION THE MORE REMARKED WHEN SOME OUTWARDAPPEAL HAD TOUCHED HER.SHE WAS NATURALLY THE SUBJECT OF MANY OBSERVATIONS THIS EVENING FORTHE DINNERPARTY WAS LARGE AND RATHER MORE MISCELLANEOUS AS TO THE MALEPORTION THAN ANY WHICH HAD BEEN HELD AT THE GRANGE SINCE MR. BROOKESNIECES HAD RESIDED WITH HIM SO THAT THE TALKING WAS DONE IN DUOS ANDTRIOS MORE OR LESS INHARMONIOUS. THERE WAS THE NEWLY ELECTED MAYOR OFMIDDLEMARCH WHO HAPPENED TO BE A MANUFACTURER THE PHILANTHROPICBANKER HIS BROTHERINLAW WHO PREDOMINATED SO MUCH IN THE TOWN THATSOME CALLED HIM A METHODIST OTHERS A HYPOCRITE ACCORDING TO THERESOURCES OF THEIR VOCABULARY AND THERE WERE VARIOUS PROFESSIONAL MEN.IN FACT MRS. CADWALLADER SAID THAT BROOKE WAS BEGINNING TO TREAT THEMIDDLEMARCHERS AND THAT SHE PREFERRED THE FARMERS AT THE TITHEDINNERWHO DRANK HER HEALTH UNPRETENTIOUSLY AND WERE NOT ASHAMED OF THEIRGRANDFATHERS FURNITURE. FOR IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY BEFORE REFORMHAD DONE ITS NOTABLE PART IN DEVELOPING THE POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESSTHERE WAS A CLEARER DISTINCTION OF RANKS AND A DIMMER DISTINCTION OFPARTIES SO THAT MR. BROOKES MISCELLANEOUS INVITATIONS SEEMED TOBELONG TO THAT GENERAL LAXITY WHICH CAME FROM HIS INORDINATE TRAVEL ANDHABIT OF TAKING TOO MUCH IN THE FORM OF IDEAS.ALREADY AS MISS BROOKE PASSED OUT OF THE DININGROOM OPPORTUNITY WASFOUND FOR SOME INTERJECTIONAL ASIDES.A FINE WOMAN MISS BROOKE AN UNCOMMONLY FINE WOMAN BY GOD SAID MR.STANDISH THE OLD LAWYER WHO HAD BEEN SO LONG CONCERNED WITH THELANDED GENTRY THAT HE HAD BECOME LANDED HIMSELF AND USED THAT OATH INA DEEPMOUTHED MANNER AS A SORT OF ARMORIAL BEARINGS STAMPING THESPEECH OF A MAN WHO HELD A GOOD POSITION.MR. BULSTRODE THE BANKER SEEMED TO BE ADDRESSED BUT THAT GENTLEMANDISLIKED COARSENESS AND PROFANITY AND MERELY BOWED. THE REMARK WASTAKEN UP BY MR. CHICHELY A MIDDLEAGED BACHELOR AND COURSINGCELEBRITY WHO HAD A COMPLEXION SOMETHING LIKE AN EASTER EGG A FEWHAIRS CAREFULLY ARRANGED AND A CARRIAGE IMPLYING THE CONSCIOUSNESS OFA DISTINGUISHED APPEARANCE.YES BUT NOT MY STYLE OF WOMAN I LIKE A WOMAN WHO LAYS HERSELF OUT ALITTLE MORE TO PLEASE US. THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE FILIGREE ABOUT AWOMANSOMETHING OF THE COQUETTE. A MAN LIKES A SORT OF CHALLENGE. THEMORE OF A DEAD SET SHE MAKES AT YOU THE BETTER.THERES SOME TRUTH IN THAT SAID MR. STANDISH DISPOSED TO BE GENIAL.AND BY GOD ITS USUALLY THE WAY WITH THEM. I SUPPOSE IT ANSWERS SOMEWISE ENDS PROVIDENCE MADE THEM SO EH BULSTRODEI SHOULD BE DISPOSED TO REFER COQUETRY TO ANOTHER SOURCE SAID MR.BULSTRODE. I SHOULD RATHER REFER IT TO THE DEVIL.AY TO BE SURE THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE DEVIL IN A WOMAN SAID MR.CHICHELY WHOSE STUDY OF THE FAIR SEX SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN DETRIMENTALTO HIS THEOLOGY. AND I LIKE THEM BLOND WITH A CERTAIN GAIT AND ASWAN NECK. BETWEEN OURSELVES THE MAYORS DAUGHTER IS MORE TO MY TASTETHAN MISS BROOKE OR MISS CELIA EITHER. IF I WERE A MARRYING MAN ISHOULD CHOOSE MISS VINCY BEFORE EITHER OF THEM.WELL MAKE UP MAKE UP SAID MR. STANDISH JOCOSELY YOU SEE THEMIDDLEAGED FELLOWS CARRY THE DAY.MR. CHICHELY SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH MUCH MEANING HE WAS NOT GOING TOINCUR THE CERTAINTY OF BEING ACCEPTED BY THE WOMAN HE WOULD CHOOSE.THE MISS VINCY WHO HAD THE HONOR OF BEING MR. CHICHELYS IDEAL WAS OFCOURSE NOT PRESENT FOR MR. BROOKE ALWAYS OBJECTING TO GO TOO FARWOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN THAT HIS NIECES SHOULD MEET THE DAUGHTER OF AMIDDLEMARCH MANUFACTURER UNLESS IT WERE ON A PUBLIC OCCASION. THEFEMININE PART OF THE COMPANY INCLUDED NONE WHOM LADY CHETTAM OR MRS.CADWALLADER COULD OBJECT TO FOR MRS. RENFREW THE COLONELS WIDOW WASNOT ONLY UNEXCEPTIONABLE IN POINT OF BREEDING BUT ALSO INTERESTING ONTHE GROUND OF HER COMPLAINT WHICH PUZZLED THE DOCTORS AND SEEMEDCLEARLY A CASE WHEREIN THE FULNESS OF PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE MIGHT NEEDTHE SUPPLEMENT OF QUACKERY. LADY CHETTAM WHO ATTRIBUTED HER OWNREMARKABLE HEALTH TO HOMEMADE BITTERS UNITED WITH CONSTANT MEDICALATTENDANCE ENTERED WITH MUCH EXERCISE OF THE IMAGINATION INTO MRS.RENFREWS ACCOUNT OF SYMPTOMS AND INTO THE AMAZING FUTILITY IN HERCASE OF ALL STRENGTHENING MEDICINES.WHERE CAN ALL THE STRENGTH OF THOSE MEDICINES GO MY DEAR SAID THEMILD BUT STATELY DOWAGER TURNING TO MRS. CADWALLADER REFLECTIVELYWHEN MRS. RENFREWS ATTENTION WAS CALLED AWAY.IT STRENGTHENS THE DISEASE SAID THE RECTORS WIFE MUCH TOOWELLBORN NOT TO BE AN AMATEUR IN MEDICINE. EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON THECONSTITUTION SOME PEOPLE MAKE FAT SOME BLOOD AND SOME BILETHATS MYVIEW OF THE MATTER AND WHATEVER THEY TAKE IS A SORT OF GRIST TO THEMILL.THEN SHE OUGHT TO TAKE MEDICINES THAT WOULD REDUCEREDUCE THE DISEASEYOU KNOW IF YOU ARE RIGHT MY DEAR. AND I THINK WHAT YOU SAY ISREASONABLE.CERTAINLY IT IS REASONABLE. YOU HAVE TWO SORTS OF POTATOES FED ON THESAME SOIL. ONE OF THEM GROWS MORE AND MORE WATERYAH LIKE THIS POOR MRS. RENFREWTHAT IS WHAT I THINK. DROPSY THERE ISNO SWELLING YETIT IS INWARD. I SHOULD SAY SHE OUGHT TO TAKE DRYINGMEDICINES SHOULDNT YOUOR A DRY HOTAIR BATH. MANY THINGS MIGHT BETRIED OF A DRYING NATURE.LET HER TRY A CERTAIN PERSONS PAMPHLETS SAID MRS. CADWALLADER IN ANUNDERTONE SEEING THE GENTLEMEN ENTER. HE DOES NOT WANT DRYING.WHO MY DEAR SAID LADY CHETTAM A CHARMING WOMAN NOT SO QUICK AS TONULLIFY THE PLEASURE OF EXPLANATION.THE BRIDEGROOMCASAUBON. HE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN DRYING UP FASTER SINCETHE ENGAGEMENT THE FLAME OF PASSION I SUPPOSE.I SHOULD THINK HE IS FAR FROM HAVING A GOOD CONSTITUTION SAID LADYCHETTAM WITH A STILL DEEPER UNDERTONE. AND THEN HIS STUDIESSO VERYDRY AS YOU SAY.REALLY BY THE SIDE OF SIR JAMES HE LOOKS LIKE A DEATHS HEAD SKINNEDOVER FOR THE OCCASION. MARK MY WORDS IN A YEAR FROM THIS TIME THATGIRL WILL HATE HIM. SHE LOOKS UP TO HIM AS AN ORACLE NOW AND BYANDBYSHE WILL BE AT THE OTHER EXTREME. ALL FLIGHTINESSHOW VERY SHOCKING I FEAR SHE IS HEADSTRONG. BUT TELL MEYOU KNOW ALLABOUT HIMIS THERE ANYTHING VERY BAD WHAT IS THE TRUTHTHE TRUTH HE IS AS BAD AS THE WRONG PHYSICNASTY TO TAKE AND SURE TODISAGREE.THERE COULD NOT BE ANYTHING WORSE THAN THAT SAID LADY CHETTAM WITHSO VIVID A CONCEPTION OF THE PHYSIC THAT SHE SEEMED TO HAVE LEARNEDSOMETHING EXACT ABOUT MR. CASAUBONS DISADVANTAGES. HOWEVER JAMESWILL HEAR NOTHING AGAINST MISS BROOKE. HE SAYS SHE IS THE MIRROR OFWOMEN STILL.THAT IS A GENEROUS MAKEBELIEVE OF HIS. DEPEND UPON IT HE LIKESLITTLE CELIA BETTER AND SHE APPRECIATES HIM. I HOPE YOU LIKE MY LITTLECELIACERTAINLY SHE IS FONDER OF GERANIUMS AND SEEMS MORE DOCILE THOUGHNOT SO FINE A FIGURE. BUT WE WERE TALKING OF PHYSIC. TELL ME ABOUT THISNEW YOUNG SURGEON MR. LYDGATE. I AM TOLD HE IS WONDERFULLY CLEVER HECERTAINLY LOOKS ITA FINE BROW INDEED.HE IS A GENTLEMAN. I HEARD HIM TALKING TO HUMPHREY. HE TALKS WELL.YES. MR. BROOKE SAYS HE IS ONE OF THE LYDGATES OF NORTHUMBERLANDREALLY WELL CONNECTED. ONE DOES NOT EXPECT IT IN A PRACTITIONER OF THATKIND. FOR MY OWN PART I LIKE A MEDICAL MAN MORE ON A FOOTING WITH THESERVANTS THEY ARE OFTEN ALL THE CLEVERER. I ASSURE YOU I FOUND POORHICKSS JUDGMENT UNFAILING I NEVER KNEW HIM WRONG. HE WAS COARSE ANDBUTCHERLIKE BUT HE KNEW MY CONSTITUTION. IT WAS A LOSS TO ME HISGOING OFF SO SUDDENLY. DEAR ME WHAT A VERY ANIMATED CONVERSATION MISSBROOKE SEEMS TO BE HAVING WITH THIS MR. LYDGATESHE IS TALKING COTTAGES AND HOSPITALS WITH HIM SAID MRS.CADWALLADER WHOSE EARS AND POWER OF INTERPRETATION WERE QUICK. IBELIEVE HE IS A SORT OF PHILANTHROPIST SO BROOKE IS SURE TO TAKE HIMUP.JAMES SAID LADY CHETTAM WHEN HER SON CAME NEAR BRING MR. LYDGATEAND INTRODUCE HIM TO ME. I WANT TO TEST HIM.THE AFFABLE DOWAGER DECLARED HERSELF DELIGHTED WITH THIS OPPORTUNITY OFMAKING MR. LYDGATES ACQUAINTANCE HAVING HEARD OF HIS SUCCESS INTREATING FEVER ON A NEW PLAN.MR. LYDGATE HAD THE MEDICAL ACCOMPLISHMENT OF LOOKING PERFECTLY GRAVEWHATEVER NONSENSE WAS TALKED TO HIM AND HIS DARK STEADY EYES GAVE HIMIMPRESSIVENESS AS A LISTENER. HE WAS AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE LIKE THELAMENTED HICKS ESPECIALLY IN A CERTAIN CARELESS REFINEMENT ABOUT HISTOILET AND UTTERANCE. YET LADY CHETTAM GATHERED MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIM.HE CONFIRMED HER VIEW OF HER OWN CONSTITUTION AS BEING PECULIAR BYADMITTING THAT ALL CONSTITUTIONS MIGHT BE CALLED PECULIAR AND HE DIDNOT DENY THAT HERS MIGHT BE MORE PECULIAR THAN OTHERS. HE DID NOTAPPROVE OF A TOO LOWERING SYSTEM INCLUDING RECKLESS CUPPING NOR ONTHE OTHER HAND OF INCESSANT PORT WINE AND BARK. HE SAID I THINK SOWITH AN AIR OF SO MUCH DEFERENCE ACCOMPANYING THE INSIGHT OF AGREEMENTTHAT SHE FORMED THE MOST CORDIAL OPINION OF HIS TALENTS.I AM QUITE PLEASED WITH YOUR PROTEGE SHE SAID TO MR. BROOKE BEFOREGOING AWAY.MY PROTEGEDEAR MEWHO IS THAT SAID MR. BROOKE.THIS YOUNG LYDGATE THE NEW DOCTOR. HE SEEMS TO ME TO UNDERSTAND HISPROFESSION ADMIRABLY.OH LYDGATE HE IS NOT MY PROTEGE YOU KNOW ONLY I KNEW AN UNCLE OFHIS WHO SENT ME A LETTER ABOUT HIM. HOWEVER I THINK HE IS LIKELY TO BEFIRSTRATEHAS STUDIED IN PARIS KNEW BROUSSAIS HAS IDEAS YOUKNOWWANTS TO RAISE THE PROFESSION.LYDGATE HAS LOTS OF IDEAS QUITE NEW ABOUT VENTILATION AND DIET THATSORT OF THING RESUMED MR. BROOKE AFTER HE HAD HANDED OUT LADYCHETTAM AND HAD RETURNED TO BE CIVIL TO A GROUP OF MIDDLEMARCHERS.HANG IT DO YOU THINK THAT IS QUITE SOUNDUPSETTING THE OLDTREATMENT WHICH HAS MADE ENGLISHMEN WHAT THEY ARE SAID MR. STANDISH.MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE IS AT A LOW EBB AMONG US SAID MR. BULSTRODE WHOSPOKE IN A SUBDUED TONE AND HAD RATHER A SICKLY AIR. I FOR MY PARTHAIL THE ADVENT OF MR. LYDGATE. I HOPE TO FIND GOOD REASON FORCONFIDING THE NEW HOSPITAL TO HIS MANAGEMENT.THAT IS ALL VERY FINE REPLIED MR. STANDISH WHO WAS NOT FOND OF MR.BULSTRODE IF YOU LIKE HIM TO TRY EXPERIMENTS ON YOUR HOSPITALPATIENTS AND KILL A FEW PEOPLE FOR CHARITY I HAVE NO OBJECTION. BUT IAM NOT GOING TO HAND MONEY OUT OF MY PURSE TO HAVE EXPERIMENTS TRIED ONME. I LIKE TREATMENT THAT HAS BEEN TESTED A LITTLE.WELL YOU KNOW STANDISH EVERY DOSE YOU TAKE IS AN EXPERIMENTANEXPERIMENT YOU KNOW SAID MR. BROOKE NODDING TOWARDS THE LAWYER.OH IF YOU TALK IN THAT SENSE SAID MR. STANDISH WITH AS MUCHDISGUST AT SUCH NONLEGAL QUIBBLING AS A MAN CAN WELL BETRAY TOWARDS AVALUABLE CLIENT.I SHOULD BE GLAD OF ANY TREATMENT THAT WOULD CURE ME WITHOUT REDUCINGME TO A SKELETON LIKE POOR GRAINGER SAID MR. VINCY THE MAYOR AFLORID MAN WHO WOULD HAVE SERVED FOR A STUDY OF FLESH IN STRIKINGCONTRAST WITH THE FRANCISCAN TINTS OF MR. BULSTRODE. ITS ANUNCOMMONLY DANGEROUS THING TO BE LEFT WITHOUT ANY PADDING AGAINST THESHAFTS OF DISEASE AS SOMEBODY SAIDAND I THINK IT A VERY GOODEXPRESSION MYSELF.MR. LYDGATE OF COURSE WAS OUT OF HEARING. HE HAD QUITTED THE PARTYEARLY AND WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT ALTOGETHER TEDIOUS BUT FOR THE NOVELTYOF CERTAIN INTRODUCTIONS ESPECIALLY THE INTRODUCTION TO MISS BROOKEWHOSE YOUTHFUL BLOOM WITH HER APPROACHING MARRIAGE TO THAT FADEDSCHOLAR AND HER INTEREST IN MATTERS SOCIALLY USEFUL GAVE HER THEPIQUANCY OF AN UNUSUAL COMBINATION.SHE IS A GOOD CREATURETHAT FINE GIRLBUT A LITTLE TOO EARNEST HETHOUGHT. IT IS TROUBLESOME TO TALK TO SUCH WOMEN. THEY ARE ALWAYSWANTING REASONS YET THEY ARE TOO IGNORANT TO UNDERSTAND THE MERITS OFANY QUESTION AND USUALLY FALL BACK ON THEIR MORAL SENSE TO SETTLETHINGS AFTER THEIR OWN TASTE.EVIDENTLY MISS BROOKE WAS NOT MR. LYDGATES STYLE OF WOMAN ANY MORETHAN MR. CHICHELYS. CONSIDERED INDEED IN RELATION TO THE LATTERWHOSE MIND WAS MATURED SHE WAS ALTOGETHER A MISTAKE AND CALCULATED TOSHOCK HIS TRUST IN FINAL CAUSES INCLUDING THE ADAPTATION OF FINE YOUNGWOMEN TO PURPLEFACED BACHELORS. BUT LYDGATE WAS LESS RIPE AND MIGHTPOSSIBLY HAVE EXPERIENCE BEFORE HIM WHICH WOULD MODIFY HIS OPINION ASTO THE MOST EXCELLENT THINGS IN WOMAN.MISS BROOKE HOWEVER WAS NOT AGAIN SEEN BY EITHER OF THESE GENTLEMENUNDER HER MAIDEN NAME. NOT LONG AFTER THAT DINNERPARTY SHE HAD BECOMEMRS. CASAUBON AND WAS ON HER WAY TO ROME.CHAPTER XI.BUT DEEDS AND LANGUAGE SUCH AS MEN DO USEAND PERSONS SUCH AS COMEDY WOULD CHOOSEWHEN SHE WOULD SHOW AN IMAGE OF THE TIMESAND SPORT WITH HUMAN FOLLIES NOT WITH CRIMES.BEN JONSON.LYDGATE IN FACT WAS ALREADY CONSCIOUS OF BEING FASCINATED BY A WOMANSTRIKINGLY DIFFERENT FROM MISS BROOKE HE DID NOT IN THE LEAST SUPPOSETHAT HE HAD LOST HIS BALANCE AND FALLEN IN LOVE BUT HE HAD SAID OFTHAT PARTICULAR WOMAN SHE IS GRACE ITSELF SHE IS PERFECTLY LOVELYAND ACCOMPLISHED. THAT IS WHAT A WOMAN OUGHT TO BE SHE OUGHT TOPRODUCE THE EFFECT OF EXQUISITE MUSIC. PLAIN WOMEN HE REGARDED AS HEDID THE OTHER SEVERE FACTS OF LIFE TO BE FACED WITH PHILOSOPHY ANDINVESTIGATED BY SCIENCE. BUT ROSAMOND VINCY SEEMED TO HAVE THE TRUEMELODIC CHARM AND WHEN A MAN HAS SEEN THE WOMAN WHOM HE WOULD HAVECHOSEN IF HE HAD INTENDED TO MARRY SPEEDILY HIS REMAINING A BACHELORWILL USUALLY DEPEND ON HER RESOLUTION RATHER THAN ON HIS. LYDGATEBELIEVED THAT HE SHOULD NOT MARRY FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOT MARRY UNTIL HEHAD TRODDEN OUT A GOOD CLEAR PATH FOR HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE BROAD ROADWHICH WAS QUITE READY MADE. HE HAD SEEN MISS VINCY ABOVE HIS HORIZONALMOST AS LONG AS IT HAD TAKEN MR. CASAUBON TO BECOME ENGAGED ANDMARRIED BUT THIS LEARNED GENTLEMAN WAS POSSESSED OF A FORTUNE HE HADASSEMBLED HIS VOLUMINOUS NOTES AND HAD MADE THAT SORT OF REPUTATIONWHICH PRECEDES PERFORMANCEOFTEN THE LARGER PART OF A MANS FAME. HETOOK A WIFE AS WE HAVE SEEN TO ADORN THE REMAINING QUADRANT OF HISCOURSE AND BE A LITTLE MOON THAT WOULD CAUSE HARDLY A CALCULABLEPERTURBATION. BUT LYDGATE WAS YOUNG POOR AMBITIOUS. HE HAD HISHALFCENTURY BEFORE HIM INSTEAD OF BEHIND HIM AND HE HAD COME TOMIDDLEMARCH BENT ON DOING MANY THINGS THAT WERE NOT DIRECTLY FITTED TOMAKE HIS FORTUNE OR EVEN SECURE HIM A GOOD INCOME. TO A MAN UNDER SUCHCIRCUMSTANCES TAKING A WIFE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN A QUESTION OFADORNMENT HOWEVER HIGHLY HE MAY RATE THIS AND LYDGATE WAS DISPOSED TOGIVE IT THE FIRST PLACE AMONG WIFELY FUNCTIONS. TO HIS TASTE GUIDED BYA SINGLE CONVERSATION HERE WAS THE POINT ON WHICH MISS BROOKE WOULD BEFOUND WANTING NOTWITHSTANDING HER UNDENIABLE BEAUTY. SHE DID NOT LOOKAT THINGS FROM THE PROPER FEMININE ANGLE. THE SOCIETY OF SUCH WOMEN WASABOUT AS RELAXING AS GOING FROM YOUR WORK TO TEACH THE SECOND FORMINSTEAD OF RECLINING IN A PARADISE WITH SWEET LAUGHS FOR BIRDNOTESAND BLUE EYES FOR A HEAVEN.CERTAINLY NOTHING AT PRESENT COULD SEEM MUCH LESS IMPORTANT TO LYDGATETHAN THE TURN OF MISS BROOKES MIND OR TO MISS BROOKE THAN THEQUALITIES OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD ATTRACTED THIS YOUNG SURGEON. BUT ANYONE WATCHING KEENLY THE STEALTHY CONVERGENCE OF HUMAN LOTS SEES A SLOWPREPARATION OF EFFECTS FROM ONE LIFE ON ANOTHER WHICH TELLS LIKE ACALCULATED IRONY ON THE INDIFFERENCE OR THE FROZEN STARE WITH WHICH WELOOK AT OUR UNINTRODUCED NEIGHBOR. DESTINY STANDS BY SARCASTIC WITH OURDRAMATIS PERSONAE FOLDED IN HER HAND.OLD PROVINCIAL SOCIETY HAD ITS SHARE OF THIS SUBTLE MOVEMENT HAD NOTONLY ITS STRIKING DOWNFALLS ITS BRILLIANT YOUNG PROFESSIONAL DANDIESWHO ENDED BY LIVING UP AN ENTRY WITH A DRAB AND SIX CHILDREN FOR THEIRESTABLISHMENT BUT ALSO THOSE LESS MARKED VICISSITUDES WHICH ARECONSTANTLY SHIFTING THE BOUNDARIES OF SOCIAL INTERCOURSE AND BEGETTINGNEW CONSCIOUSNESS OF INTERDEPENDENCE. SOME SLIPPED A LITTLE DOWNWARDSOME GOT HIGHER FOOTING PEOPLE DENIED ASPIRATES GAINED WEALTH ANDFASTIDIOUS GENTLEMEN STOOD FOR BOROUGHS SOME WERE CAUGHT IN POLITICALCURRENTS SOME IN ECCLESIASTICAL AND PERHAPS FOUND THEMSELVESSURPRISINGLY GROUPED IN CONSEQUENCE WHILE A FEW PERSONAGES OR FAMILIESTHAT STOOD WITH ROCKY FIRMNESS AMID ALL THIS FLUCTUATION WERE SLOWLYPRESENTING NEW ASPECTS IN SPITE OF SOLIDITY AND ALTERING WITH THEDOUBLE CHANGE OF SELF AND BEHOLDER. MUNICIPAL TOWN AND RURAL PARISHGRADUALLY MADE FRESH THREADS OF CONNECTIONGRADUALLY AS THE OLDSTOCKING GAVE WAY TO THE SAVINGSBANK AND THE WORSHIP OF THE SOLARGUINEA BECAME EXTINCT WHILE SQUIRES AND BARONETS AND EVEN LORDS WHOHAD ONCE LIVED BLAMELESSLY AFAR FROM THE CIVIC MIND GATHERED THEFAULTINESS OF CLOSER ACQUAINTANCESHIP. SETTLERS TOO CAME FROM DISTANTCOUNTIES SOME WITH AN ALARMING NOVELTY OF SKILL OTHERS WITH ANOFFENSIVE ADVANTAGE IN CUNNING. IN FACT MUCH THE SAME SORT OF MOVEMENTAND MIXTURE WENT ON IN OLD ENGLAND AS WE FIND IN OLDER HERODOTUS WHOALSO IN TELLING WHAT HAD BEEN THOUGHT IT WELL TO TAKE A WOMANS LOTFOR HIS STARTINGPOINT THOUGH IO AS A MAIDEN APPARENTLY BEGUILED BYATTRACTIVE MERCHANDISE WAS THE REVERSE OF MISS BROOKE AND IN THISRESPECT PERHAPS BORE MORE RESEMBLANCE TO ROSAMOND VINCY WHO HADEXCELLENT TASTE IN COSTUME WITH THAT NYMPHLIKE FIGURE AND PUREBLONDNESS WHICH GIVE THE LARGEST RANGE TO CHOICE IN THE FLOW AND COLOROF DRAPERY. BUT THESE THINGS MADE ONLY PART OF HER CHARM. SHE WASADMITTED TO BE THE FLOWER OF MRS. LEMONS SCHOOL THE CHIEF SCHOOL INTHE COUNTY WHERE THE TEACHING INCLUDED ALL THAT WAS DEMANDED IN THEACCOMPLISHED FEMALEEVEN TO EXTRAS SUCH AS THE GETTING IN AND OUT OF ACARRIAGE. MRS. LEMON HERSELF HAD ALWAYS HELD UP MISS VINCY AS ANEXAMPLE NO PUPIL SHE SAID EXCEEDED THAT YOUNG LADY FOR MENTALACQUISITION AND PROPRIETY OF SPEECH WHILE HER MUSICAL EXECUTION WASQUITE EXCEPTIONAL. WE CANNOT HELP THE WAY IN WHICH PEOPLE SPEAK OF USAND PROBABLY IF MRS. LEMON HAD UNDERTAKEN TO DESCRIBE JULIET OR IMOGENTHESE HEROINES WOULD NOT HAVE SEEMED POETICAL. THE FIRST VISION OFROSAMOND WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH WITH MOST JUDGES TO DISPEL ANYPREJUDICE EXCITED BY MRS. LEMONS PRAISE.LYDGATE COULD NOT BE LONG IN MIDDLEMARCH WITHOUT HAVING THAT AGREEABLEVISION OR EVEN WITHOUT MAKING THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE VINCY FAMILYFOR THOUGH MR. PEACOCK WHOSE PRACTICE HE HAD PAID SOMETHING TO ENTERON HAD NOT BEEN THEIR DOCTOR MRS. VINCY NOT LIKING THE LOWERINGSYSTEM ADOPTED BY HIM HE HAD MANY PATIENTS AMONG THEIR CONNECTIONSAND ACQUAINTANCES. FOR WHO OF ANY CONSEQUENCE IN MIDDLEMARCH WAS NOTCONNECTED OR AT LEAST ACQUAINTED WITH THE VINCYS THEY WERE OLDMANUFACTURERS AND HAD KEPT A GOOD HOUSE FOR THREE GENERATIONS INWHICH THERE HAD NATURALLY BEEN MUCH INTERMARRYING WITH NEIGHBORS MOREOR LESS DECIDEDLY GENTEEL. MR. VINCYS SISTER HAD MADE A WEALTHY MATCHIN ACCEPTING MR. BULSTRODE WHO HOWEVER AS A MAN NOT BORN IN THETOWN AND ALTOGETHER OF DIMLY KNOWN ORIGIN WAS CONSIDERED TO HAVE DONEWELL IN UNITING HIMSELF WITH A REAL MIDDLEMARCH FAMILY ON THE OTHERHAND MR. VINCY HAD DESCENDED A LITTLE HAVING TAKEN AN INNKEEPERSDAUGHTER. BUT ON THIS SIDE TOO THERE WAS A CHEERING SENSE OF MONEY FORMRS. VINCYS SISTER HAD BEEN SECOND WIFE TO RICH OLD MR. FEATHERSTONEAND HAD DIED CHILDLESS YEARS AGO SO THAT HER NEPHEWS AND NIECES MIGHTBE SUPPOSED TO TOUCH THE AFFECTIONS OF THE WIDOWER. AND IT HAPPENEDTHAT MR. BULSTRODE AND MR. FEATHERSTONE TWO OF PEACOCKS MOSTIMPORTANT PATIENTS HAD FROM DIFFERENT CAUSES GIVEN AN ESPECIALLYGOOD RECEPTION TO HIS SUCCESSOR WHO HAD RAISED SOME PARTISANSHIP ASWELL AS DISCUSSION. MR. WRENCH MEDICAL ATTENDANT TO THE VINCY FAMILYVERY EARLY HAD GROUNDS FOR THINKING LIGHTLY OF LYDGATES PROFESSIONALDISCRETION AND THERE WAS NO REPORT ABOUT HIM WHICH WAS NOT RETAILED ATTHE VINCYS WHERE VISITORS WERE FREQUENT. MR. VINCY WAS MORE INCLINEDTO GENERAL GOODFELLOWSHIP THAN TO TAKING SIDES BUT THERE WAS NO NEEDFOR HIM TO BE HASTY IN MAKING ANY NEW MAN ACQUAINTANCE. ROSAMONDSILENTLY WISHED THAT HER FATHER WOULD INVITE MR. LYDGATE. SHE WAS TIREDOF THE FACES AND FIGURES SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN USED TOTHE VARIOUSIRREGULAR PROFILES AND GAITS AND TURNS OF PHRASE DISTINGUISHING THOSEMIDDLEMARCH YOUNG MEN WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN AS BOYS. SHE HAD BEEN ATSCHOOL WITH GIRLS OF HIGHER POSITION WHOSE BROTHERS SHE FELT SURE ITWOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE FOR HER TO BE MORE INTERESTED IN THAN INTHESE INEVITABLE MIDDLEMARCH COMPANIONS. BUT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE CHOSENTO MENTION HER WISH TO HER FATHER AND HE FOR HIS PART WAS IN NOHURRY ON THE SUBJECT. AN ALDERMAN ABOUT TO BE MAYOR MUST BYANDBYENLARGE HIS DINNERPARTIES BUT AT PRESENT THERE WERE PLENTY OF GUESTSAT HIS WELLSPREAD TABLE.THAT TABLE OFTEN REMAINED COVERED WITH THE RELICS OF THE FAMILYBREAKFAST LONG AFTER MR. VINCY HAD GONE WITH HIS SECOND SON TO THEWAREHOUSE AND WHEN MISS MORGAN WAS ALREADY FAR ON IN MORNING LESSONSWITH THE YOUNGER GIRLS IN THE SCHOOLROOM. IT AWAITED THE FAMILYLAGGARD WHO FOUND ANY SORT OF INCONVENIENCE TO OTHERS LESSDISAGREEABLE THAN GETTING UP WHEN HE WAS CALLED. THIS WAS THE CASE ONEMORNING OF THE OCTOBER IN WHICH WE HAVE LATELY SEEN MR. CASAUBONVISITING THE GRANGE AND THOUGH THE ROOM WAS A LITTLE OVERHEATED WITHTHE FIRE WHICH HAD SENT THE SPANIEL PANTING TO A REMOTE CORNERROSAMOND FOR SOME REASON CONTINUED TO SIT AT HER EMBROIDERY LONGERTHAN USUAL NOW AND THEN GIVING HERSELF A LITTLE SHAKE AND LAYING HERWORK ON HER KNEE TO CONTEMPLATE IT WITH AN AIR OF HESITATING WEARINESS.HER MAMMA WHO HAD RETURNED FROM AN EXCURSION TO THE KITCHEN SAT ONTHE OTHER SIDE OF THE SMALL WORKTABLE WITH AN AIR OF MORE ENTIREPLACIDITY UNTIL THE CLOCK AGAIN GIVING NOTICE THAT IT WAS GOING TOSTRIKE SHE LOOKED UP FROM THE LACEMENDING WHICH WAS OCCUPYING HERPLUMP FINGERS AND RANG THE BELL.KNOCK AT MR. FREDS DOOR AGAIN PRITCHARD AND TELL HIM IT HAS STRUCKHALFPAST TEN.THIS WAS SAID WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN THE RADIANT GOODHUMOR OF MRS.VINCYS FACE IN WHICH FORTYFIVE YEARS HAD DELVED NEITHER ANGLES NORPARALLELS AND PUSHING BACK HER PINK CAPSTRINGS SHE LET HER WORK RESTON HER LAP WHILE SHE LOOKED ADMIRINGLY AT HER DAUGHTER.MAMMA SAID ROSAMOND WHEN FRED COMES DOWN I WISH YOU WOULD NOT LETHIM HAVE RED HERRINGS. I CANNOT BEAR THE SMELL OF THEM ALL OVER THEHOUSE AT THIS HOUR OF THE MORNING.OH MY DEAR YOU ARE SO HARD ON YOUR BROTHERS IT IS THE ONLY FAULT IHAVE TO FIND WITH YOU. YOU ARE THE SWEETEST TEMPER IN THE WORLD BUTYOU ARE SO TETCHY WITH YOUR BROTHERS.NOT TETCHY MAMMA YOU NEVER HEAR ME SPEAK IN AN UNLADYLIKE WAY.WELL BUT YOU WANT TO DENY THEM THINGS.BROTHERS ARE SO UNPLEASANT.OH MY DEAR YOU MUST ALLOW FOR YOUNG MEN. BE THANKFUL IF THEY HAVEGOOD HEARTS. A WOMAN MUST LEARN TO PUT UP WITH LITTLE THINGS. YOU WILLBE MARRIED SOME DAY.NOT TO ANY ONE WHO IS LIKE FRED.DONT DECRY YOUR OWN BROTHER MY DEAR. FEW YOUNG MEN HAVE LESS AGAINSTTHEM ALTHOUGH HE COULDNT TAKE HIS DEGREEIM SURE I CANT UNDERSTANDWHY FOR HE SEEMS TO ME MOST CLEVER. AND YOU KNOW YOURSELF HE WASTHOUGHT EQUAL TO THE BEST SOCIETY AT COLLEGE. SO PARTICULAR AS YOU AREMY DEAR I WONDER YOU ARE NOT GLAD TO HAVE SUCH A GENTLEMANLY YOUNG MANFOR A BROTHER. YOU ARE ALWAYS FINDING FAULT WITH BOB BECAUSE HE IS NOTFRED.OH NO MAMMA ONLY BECAUSE HE IS BOB.WELL MY DEAR YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY MIDDLEMARCH YOUNG MAN WHO HAS NOTSOMETHING AGAINST HIM.BUTHERE ROSAMONDS FACE BROKE INTO A SMILE WHICH SUDDENLY REVEALEDTWO DIMPLES. SHE HERSELF THOUGHT UNFAVORABLY OF THESE DIMPLES ANDSMILED LITTLE IN GENERAL SOCIETY. BUT I SHALL NOT MARRY ANYMIDDLEMARCH YOUNG MAN.SO IT SEEMS MY LOVE FOR YOU HAVE AS GOOD AS REFUSED THE PICK OFTHEM AND IF THERES BETTER TO BE HAD IM SURE THERES NO GIRL BETTERDESERVES IT.EXCUSE ME MAMMAI WISH YOU WOULD NOT SAY THE PICK OF THEM.WHY WHAT ELSE ARE THEYI MEAN MAMMA IT IS RATHER A VULGAR EXPRESSION.VERY LIKELY MY DEAR I NEVER WAS A GOOD SPEAKER. WHAT SHOULD I SAYTHE BEST OF THEM.WHY THAT SEEMS JUST AS PLAIN AND COMMON. IF I HAD HAD TIME TO THINKI SHOULD HAVE SAID THE MOST SUPERIOR YOUNG MEN. BUT WITH YOUREDUCATION YOU MUST KNOW.WHAT MUST ROSY KNOW MOTHER SAID MR. FRED WHO HAD SLID INUNOBSERVED THROUGH THE HALFOPEN DOOR WHILE THE LADIES WERE BENDINGOVER THEIR WORK AND NOW GOING UP TO THE FIRE STOOD WITH HIS BACKTOWARDS IT WARMING THE SOLES OF HIS SLIPPERS.WHETHER ITS RIGHT TO SAY SUPERIOR YOUNG MEN SAID MRS. VINCYRINGING THE BELL.OH THERE ARE SO MANY SUPERIOR TEAS AND SUGARS NOW. SUPERIOR ISGETTING TO BE SHOPKEEPERS SLANG.ARE YOU BEGINNING TO DISLIKE SLANG THEN SAID ROSAMOND WITH MILDGRAVITY.ONLY THE WRONG SORT. ALL CHOICE OF WORDS IS SLANG. IT MARKS A CLASS.THERE IS CORRECT ENGLISH THAT IS NOT SLANG.I BEG YOUR PARDON CORRECT ENGLISH IS THE SLANG OF PRIGS WHO WRITEHISTORY AND ESSAYS. AND THE STRONGEST SLANG OF ALL IS THE SLANG OFPOETS.YOU WILL SAY ANYTHING FRED TO GAIN YOUR POINT.WELL TELL ME WHETHER IT IS SLANG OR POETRY TO CALL AN OX ALEGPLAITER.OF COURSE YOU CAN CALL IT POETRY IF YOU LIKE.AHA MISS ROSY YOU DONT KNOW HOMER FROM SLANG. I SHALL INVENT A NEWGAME I SHALL WRITE BITS OF SLANG AND POETRY ON SLIPS AND GIVE THEM TOYOU TO SEPARATE.DEAR ME HOW AMUSING IT IS TO HEAR YOUNG PEOPLE TALK SAID MRS.VINCY WITH CHEERFUL ADMIRATION.HAVE YOU GOT NOTHING ELSE FOR MY BREAKFAST PRITCHARD SAID FRED TOTHE SERVANT WHO BROUGHT IN COFFEE AND BUTTERED TOAST WHILE HE WALKEDROUND THE TABLE SURVEYING THE HAM POTTED BEEF AND OTHER COLDREMNANTS WITH AN AIR OF SILENT REJECTION AND POLITE FORBEARANCE FROMSIGNS OF DISGUST.SHOULD YOU LIKE EGGS SIREGGS NO BRING ME A GRILLED BONE.REALLY FRED SAID ROSAMOND WHEN THE SERVANT HAD LEFT THE ROOM IFYOU MUST HAVE HOT THINGS FOR BREAKFAST I WISH YOU WOULD COME DOWNEARLIER. YOU CAN GET UP AT SIX OCLOCK TO GO OUT HUNTING I CANNOTUNDERSTAND WHY YOU FIND IT SO DIFFICULT TO GET UP ON OTHER MORNINGS.THAT IS YOUR WANT OF UNDERSTANDING ROSY. I CAN GET UP TO GO HUNTINGBECAUSE I LIKE IT.WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF ME IF I CAME DOWN TWO HOURS AFTER EVERY ONEELSE AND ORDERED GRILLED BONEI SHOULD THINK YOU WERE AN UNCOMMONLY FAST YOUNG LADY SAID FREDEATING HIS TOAST WITH THE UTMOST COMPOSURE.I CANNOT SEE WHY BROTHERS ARE TO MAKE THEMSELVES DISAGREEABLE ANYMORE THAN SISTERS.I DONT MAKE MYSELF DISAGREEABLE IT IS YOU WHO FIND ME SO.DISAGREEABLE IS A WORD THAT DESCRIBES YOUR FEELINGS AND NOT MYACTIONS.I THINK IT DESCRIBES THE SMELL OF GRILLED BONE.NOT AT ALL. IT DESCRIBES A SENSATION IN YOUR LITTLE NOSE ASSOCIATEDWITH CERTAIN FINICKING NOTIONS WHICH ARE THE CLASSICS OF MRS. LEMONSSCHOOL. LOOK AT MY MOTHER YOU DONT SEE HER OBJECTING TO EVERYTHINGEXCEPT WHAT SHE DOES HERSELF. SHE IS MY NOTION OF A PLEASANT WOMAN.BLESS YOU BOTH MY DEARS AND DONT QUARREL SAID MRS. VINCY WITHMOTHERLY CORDIALITY. COME FRED TELL US ALL ABOUT THE NEW DOCTOR. HOWIS YOUR UNCLE PLEASED WITH HIMPRETTY WELL I THINK. HE ASKS LYDGATE ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AND THENSCREWS UP HIS FACE WHILE HE HEARS THE ANSWERS AS IF THEY WERE PINCHINGHIS TOES. THATS HIS WAY. AH HERE COMES MY GRILLED BONE.BUT HOW CAME YOU TO STAY OUT SO LATE MY DEAR YOU ONLY SAID YOU WEREGOING TO YOUR UNCLES.OH I DINED AT PLYMDALES. WE HAD WHIST. LYDGATE WAS THERE TOO.AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM HE IS VERY GENTLEMANLY I SUPPOSE. THEYSAY HE IS OF EXCELLENT FAMILYHIS RELATIONS QUITE COUNTY PEOPLE.YES SAID FRED. THERE WAS A LYDGATE AT JOHNS WHO SPENT NO END OFMONEY. I FIND THIS MAN IS A SECOND COUSIN OF HIS. BUT RICH MEN MAY HAVEVERY POOR DEVILS FOR SECOND COUSINS.IT ALWAYS MAKES A DIFFERENCE THOUGH TO BE OF GOOD FAMILY SAIDROSAMOND WITH A TONE OF DECISION WHICH SHOWED THAT SHE HAD THOUGHT ONTHIS SUBJECT. ROSAMOND FELT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAPPIER IF SHE HADNOT BEEN THE DAUGHTER OF A MIDDLEMARCH MANUFACTURER. SHE DISLIKEDANYTHING WHICH REMINDED HER THAT HER MOTHERS FATHER HAD BEEN ANINNKEEPER. CERTAINLY ANY ONE REMEMBERING THE FACT MIGHT THINK THAT MRS.VINCY HAD THE AIR OF A VERY HANDSOME GOODHUMORED LANDLADY ACCUSTOMEDTO THE MOST CAPRICIOUS ORDERS OF GENTLEMEN.I THOUGHT IT WAS ODD HIS NAME WAS TERTIUS SAID THE BRIGHTFACEDMATRON BUT OF COURSE ITS A NAME IN THE FAMILY. BUT NOW TELL USEXACTLY WHAT SORT OF MAN HE IS.OH TALLISH DARK CLEVERTALKS WELLRATHER A PRIG I THINK.I NEVER CAN MAKE OUT WHAT YOU MEAN BY A PRIG SAID ROSAMOND.A FELLOW WHO WANTS TO SHOW THAT HE HAS OPINIONS.WHY MY DEAR DOCTORS MUST HAVE OPINIONS SAID MRS. VINCY. WHAT ARETHEY THERE FOR ELSEYES MOTHER THE OPINIONS THEY ARE PAID FOR. BUT A PRIG IS A FELLOWWHO IS ALWAYS MAKING YOU A PRESENT OF HIS OPINIONS.I SUPPOSE MARY GARTH ADMIRES MR. LYDGATE SAID ROSAMOND NOT WITHOUTA TOUCH OF INNUENDO.REALLY I CANT SAY. SAID FRED RATHER GLUMLY AS HE LEFT THE TABLEAND TAKING UP A NOVEL WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT DOWN WITH HIM THREW HIMSELFINTO AN ARMCHAIR. IF YOU ARE JEALOUS OF HER GO OFTENER TO STONECOURT YOURSELF AND ECLIPSE HER.I WISH YOU WOULD NOT BE SO VULGAR FRED. IF YOU HAVE FINISHED PRAYRING THE BELL.IT IS TRUE THOUGHWHAT YOUR BROTHER SAYS ROSAMOND MRS. VINCYBEGAN WHEN THE SERVANT HAD CLEARED THE TABLE. IT IS A THOUSAND PITIESYOU HAVENT PATIENCE TO GO AND SEE YOUR UNCLE MORE SO PROUD OF YOU ASHE IS AND WANTED YOU TO LIVE WITH HIM. THERES NO KNOWING WHAT HEMIGHT HAVE DONE FOR YOU AS WELL AS FOR FRED. GOD KNOWS IM FOND OFHAVING YOU AT HOME WITH ME BUT I CAN PART WITH MY CHILDREN FOR THEIRGOOD. AND NOW IT STANDS TO REASON THAT YOUR UNCLE FEATHERSTONE WILL DOSOMETHING FOR MARY GARTH.MARY GARTH CAN BEAR BEING AT STONE COURT BECAUSE SHE LIKES THATBETTER THAN BEING A GOVERNESS SAID ROSAMOND FOLDING UP HER WORK. IWOULD RATHER NOT HAVE ANYTHING LEFT TO ME IF I MUST EARN IT BY ENDURINGMUCH OF MY UNCLES COUGH AND HIS UGLY RELATIONS.HE CANT BE LONG FOR THIS WORLD MY DEAR I WOULDNT HASTEN HIS ENDBUT WHAT WITH ASTHMA AND THAT INWARD COMPLAINT LET US HOPE THERE ISSOMETHING BETTER FOR HIM IN ANOTHER. AND I HAVE NO ILLWILL TOWARDSMARY GARTH BUT THERES JUSTICE TO BE THOUGHT OF. AND MR.FEATHERSTONES FIRST WIFE BROUGHT HIM NO MONEY AS MY SISTER DID. HERNIECES AND NEPHEWS CANT HAVE SO MUCH CLAIM AS MY SISTERS. AND I MUSTSAY I THINK MARY GARTH A DREADFUL PLAIN GIRLMORE FIT FOR A GOVERNESS.EVERY ONE WOULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU THERE MOTHER SAID FRED WHOSEEMED TO BE ABLE TO READ AND LISTEN TOO.WELL MY DEAR SAID MRS. VINCY WHEELING SKILFULLY IF SHE HADSOME FORTUNE LEFT HERA MAN MARRIES HIS WIFES RELATIONS AND THEGARTHS ARE SO POOR AND LIVE IN SUCH A SMALL WAY. BUT I SHALL LEAVE YOUTO YOUR STUDIES MY DEAR FOR I MUST GO AND DO SOME SHOPPING.FREDS STUDIES ARE NOT VERY DEEP SAID ROSAMOND RISING WITH HERMAMMA HE IS ONLY READING A NOVEL.WELL WELL BYANDBY HELL GO TO HIS LATIN AND THINGS SAID MRS.VINCY SOOTHINGLY STROKING HER SONS HEAD. THERES A FIRE IN THESMOKINGROOM ON PURPOSE. ITS YOUR FATHERS WISH YOU KNOWFRED MYDEARAND I ALWAYS TELL HIM YOU WILL BE GOOD AND GO TO COLLEGE AGAIN TOTAKE YOUR DEGREE.FRED DREW HIS MOTHERS HAND DOWN TO HIS LIPS BUT SAID NOTHING.I SUPPOSE YOU ARE NOT GOING OUT RIDING TODAY SAID ROSAMONDLINGERING A LITTLE AFTER HER MAMMA WAS GONE.NO WHYPAPA SAYS I MAY HAVE THE CHESTNUT TO RIDE NOW.YOU CAN GO WITH ME TOMORROW IF YOU LIKE. ONLY I AM GOING TO STONECOURT REMEMBER.I WANT TO RIDE SO MUCH IT IS INDIFFERENT TO ME WHERE WE GO. ROSAMONDREALLY WISHED TO GO TO STONE COURT OF ALL OTHER PLACES.OH I SAY ROSY SAID FRED AS SHE WAS PASSING OUT OF THE ROOM IFYOU ARE GOING TO THE PIANO LET ME COME AND PLAY SOME AIRS WITH YOU.PRAY DO NOT ASK ME THIS MORNING.WHY NOT THIS MORNINGREALLY FRED I WISH YOU WOULD LEAVE OFF PLAYING THE FLUTE. A MANLOOKS VERY SILLY PLAYING THE FLUTE. AND YOU PLAY SO OUT OF TUNE.WHEN NEXT ANY ONE MAKES LOVE TO YOU MISS ROSAMOND I WILL TELL HIMHOW OBLIGING YOU ARE.WHY SHOULD YOU EXPECT ME TO OBLIGE YOU BY HEARING YOU PLAY THE FLUTEANY MORE THAN I SHOULD EXPECT YOU TO OBLIGE ME BY NOT PLAYING ITAND WHY SHOULD YOU EXPECT ME TO TAKE YOU OUT RIDINGTHIS QUESTION LED TO AN ADJUSTMENT FOR ROSAMOND HAD SET HER MIND ONTHAT PARTICULAR RIDE.SO FRED WAS GRATIFIED WITH NEARLY AN HOURS PRACTICE OF AR HYD Y NOSYE BANKS AND BRAES AND OTHER FAVORITE AIRS FROM HIS INSTRUCTOR ONTHE FLUTE A WHEEZY PERFORMANCE INTO WHICH HE THREW MUCH AMBITION ANDAN IRREPRESSIBLE HOPEFULNESS.CHAPTER XII.HE HAD MORE TOW ON HIS DISTAFFETHAN GERVEIS KNEW.CHAUCER.THE RIDE TO STONE COURT WHICH FRED AND ROSAMOND TOOK THE NEXT MORNINGLAY THROUGH A PRETTY BIT OF MIDLAND LANDSCAPE ALMOST ALL MEADOWS ANDPASTURES WITH HEDGEROWS STILL ALLOWED TO GROW IN BUSHY BEAUTY AND TOSPREAD OUT CORAL FRUIT FOR THE BIRDS. LITTLE DETAILS GAVE EACH FIELD APARTICULAR PHYSIOGNOMY DEAR TO THE EYES THAT HAVE LOOKED ON THEM FROMCHILDHOOD THE POOL IN THE CORNER WHERE THE GRASSES WERE DANK AND TREESLEANED WHISPERINGLY THE GREAT OAK SHADOWING A BARE PLACE INMIDPASTURE THE HIGH BANK WHERE THE ASHTREES GREW THE SUDDEN SLOPEOF THE OLD MARLPIT MAKING A RED BACKGROUND FOR THE BURDOCK THEHUDDLED ROOFS AND RICKS OF THE HOMESTEAD WITHOUT A TRACEABLE WAY OFAPPROACH THE GRAY GATE AND FENCES AGAINST THE DEPTHS OF THE BORDERINGWOOD AND THE STRAY HOVEL ITS OLD OLD THATCH FULL OF MOSSY HILLS ANDVALLEYS WITH WONDROUS MODULATIONS OF LIGHT AND SHADOW SUCH AS WE TRAVELFAR TO SEE IN LATER LIFE AND SEE LARGER BUT NOT MORE BEAUTIFUL. THESEARE THE THINGS THAT MAKE THE GAMUT OF JOY IN LANDSCAPE TO MIDLANDBREDSOULSTHE THINGS THEY TODDLED AMONG OR PERHAPS LEARNED BY HEARTSTANDING BETWEEN THEIR FATHERS KNEES WHILE HE DROVE LEISURELY.BUT THE ROAD EVEN THE BYROAD WAS EXCELLENT FOR LOWICK AS WE HAVESEEN WAS NOT A PARISH OF MUDDY LANES AND POOR TENANTS AND IT WAS INTOLOWICK PARISH THAT FRED AND ROSAMOND ENTERED AFTER A COUPLE OF MILESRIDING. ANOTHER MILE WOULD BRING THEM TO STONE COURT AND AT THE END OFTHE FIRST HALF THE HOUSE WAS ALREADY VISIBLE LOOKING AS IF IT HADBEEN ARRESTED IN ITS GROWTH TOWARD A STONE MANSION BY AN UNEXPECTEDBUDDING OF FARMBUILDINGS ON ITS LEFT FLANK WHICH HAD HINDERED IT FROMBECOMING ANYTHING MORE THAN THE SUBSTANTIAL DWELLING OF A GENTLEMANFARMER. IT WAS NOT THE LESS AGREEABLE AN OBJECT IN THE DISTANCE FOR THECLUSTER OF PINNACLED CORNRICKS WHICH BALANCED THE FINE ROW OF WALNUTSON THE RIGHT.PRESENTLY IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DISCERN SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE A GIG ONTHE CIRCULAR DRIVE BEFORE THE FRONT DOOR.DEAR ME SAID ROSAMOND I HOPE NONE OF MY UNCLES HORRIBLE RELATIONSARE THERE.THEY ARE THOUGH. THAT IS MRS. WAULES GIGTHE LAST YELLOW GIG LEFT ISHOULD THINK. WHEN I SEE MRS. WAULE IN IT I UNDERSTAND HOW YELLOW CANHAVE BEEN WORN FOR MOURNING. THAT GIG SEEMS TO ME MORE FUNEREAL THAN AHEARSE. BUT THEN MRS. WAULE ALWAYS HAS BLACK CRAPE ON. HOW DOES SHEMANAGE IT ROSY HER FRIENDS CANT ALWAYS BE DYING.I DONT KNOW AT ALL. AND SHE IS NOT IN THE LEAST EVANGELICAL SAIDROSAMOND REFLECTIVELY AS IF THAT RELIGIOUS POINT OF VIEW WOULD HAVEFULLY ACCOUNTED FOR PERPETUAL CRAPE. AND NOT POOR SHE ADDED AFTERA MOMENTS PAUSE.NO BY GEORGE THEY ARE AS RICH AS JEWS THOSE WAULES ANDFEATHERSTONES I MEAN FOR PEOPLE LIKE THEM WHO DONT WANT TO SPENDANYTHING. AND YET THEY HANG ABOUT MY UNCLE LIKE VULTURES AND AREAFRAID OF A FARTHING GOING AWAY FROM THEIR SIDE OF THE FAMILY. BUT IBELIEVE HE HATES THEM ALL.THE MRS. WAULE WHO WAS SO FAR FROM BEING ADMIRABLE IN THE EYES OF THESEDISTANT CONNECTIONS HAD HAPPENED TO SAY THIS VERY MORNING NOT AT ALLWITH A DEFIANT AIR BUT IN A LOW MUFFLED NEUTRAL TONE AS OF A VOICEHEARD THROUGH COTTON WOOL THAT SHE DID NOT WISH TO ENJOY THEIR GOODOPINION. SHE WAS SEATED AS SHE OBSERVED ON HER OWN BROTHERS HEARTHAND HAD BEEN JANE FEATHERSTONE FIVEANDTWENTY YEARS BEFORE SHE HADBEEN JANE WAULE WHICH ENTITLED HER TO SPEAK WHEN HER OWN BROTHERSNAME HAD BEEN MADE FREE WITH BY THOSE WHO HAD NO RIGHT TO IT.WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT THERE SAID MR. FEATHERSTONE HOLDING HISSTICK BETWEEN HIS KNEES AND SETTLING HIS WIG WHILE HE GAVE HER AMOMENTARY SHARP GLANCE WHICH SEEMED TO REACT ON HIM LIKE A DRAUGHT OFCOLD AIR AND SET HIM COUGHING.MRS. WAULE HAD TO DEFER HER ANSWER TILL HE WAS QUIET AGAIN TILL MARYGARTH HAD SUPPLIED HIM WITH FRESH SYRUP AND HE HAD BEGUN TO RUB THEGOLD KNOB OF HIS STICK LOOKING BITTERLY AT THE FIRE. IT WAS A BRIGHTFIRE BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE CHILLLOOKING PURPLISH TINT OFMRS. WAULES FACE WHICH WAS AS NEUTRAL AS HER VOICE HAVING MERECHINKS FOR EYES AND LIPS THAT HARDLY MOVED IN SPEAKING.THE DOCTORS CANT MASTER THAT COUGH BROTHER. ITS JUST LIKE WHAT IHAVE FOR IM YOUR OWN SISTER CONSTITUTION AND EVERYTHING. BUT AS IWAS SAYING ITS A PITY MRS. VINCYS FAMILY CANT BE BETTER CONDUCTED.TCHAH YOU SAID NOTHING O THE SORT. YOU SAID SOMEBODY HAD MADE FREEWITH MY NAME.AND NO MORE THAN CAN BE PROVED IF WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS IS TRUE. MYBROTHER SOLOMON TELLS ME ITS THE TALK UP AND DOWN IN MIDDLEMARCH HOWUNSTEADY YOUNG VINCY IS AND HAS BEEN FOREVER GAMBLING AT BILLIARDSSINCE HOME HE CAME.NONSENSE WHATS A GAME AT BILLIARDS ITS A GOOD GENTLEMANLY GAMEAND YOUNG VINCY IS NOT A CLODHOPPER. IF YOUR SON JOHN TOOK TOBILLIARDS NOW HED MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF.YOUR NEPHEW JOHN NEVER TOOK TO BILLIARDS OR ANY OTHER GAME BROTHERAND IS FAR FROM LOSING HUNDREDS OF POUNDS WHICH IF WHAT EVERYBODYSAYS IS TRUE MUST BE FOUND SOMEWHERE ELSE THAN OUT OF MR. VINCY THEFATHERS POCKET. FOR THEY SAY HES BEEN LOSING MONEY FOR YEARS THOUGHNOBODY WOULD THINK SO TO SEE HIM GO COURSING AND KEEPING OPEN HOUSE ASTHEY DO. AND IVE HEARD SAY MR. BULSTRODE CONDEMNS MRS. VINCY BEYONDANYTHING FOR HER FLIGHTINESS AND SPOILING HER CHILDREN SO.WHATS BULSTRODE TO ME I DONT BANK WITH HIM.WELL MRS. BULSTRODE IS MR. VINCYS OWN SISTER AND THEY DO SAY THATMR. VINCY MOSTLY TRADES ON THE BANK MONEY AND YOU MAY SEE YOURSELFBROTHER WHEN A WOMAN PAST FORTY HAS PINK STRINGS ALWAYS FLYING ANDTHAT LIGHT WAY OF LAUGHING AT EVERYTHING ITS VERY UNBECOMING. BUTINDULGING YOUR CHILDREN IS ONE THING AND FINDING MONEY TO PAY THEIRDEBTS IS ANOTHER. AND ITS OPENLY SAID THAT YOUNG VINCY HAS RAISEDMONEY ON HIS EXPECTATIONS. I DONT SAY WHAT EXPECTATIONS. MISS GARTHHEARS ME AND IS WELCOME TO TELL AGAIN. I KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE HANGTOGETHER.NO THANK YOU MRS. WAULE SAID MARY GARTH. I DISLIKE HEARINGSCANDAL TOO MUCH TO WISH TO REPEAT IT.MR. FEATHERSTONE RUBBED THE KNOB OF HIS STICK AND MADE A BRIEFCONVULSIVE SHOW OF LAUGHTER WHICH HAD MUCH THE SAME GENUINENESS AS ANOLD WHISTPLAYERS CHUCKLE OVER A BAD HAND. STILL LOOKING AT THE FIREHE SAIDAND WHO PRETENDS TO SAY FRED VINCY HASNT GOT EXPECTATIONS SUCH AFINE SPIRITED FELLOW IS LIKE ENOUGH TO HAVE EM.THERE WAS A SLIGHT PAUSE BEFORE MRS. WAULE REPLIED AND WHEN SHE DIDSO HER VOICE SEEMED TO BE SLIGHTLY MOISTENED WITH TEARS THOUGH HERFACE WAS STILL DRY.WHETHER OR NO BROTHER IT IS NATURALLY PAINFUL TO ME AND MY BROTHERSOLOMON TO HEAR YOUR NAME MADE FREE WITH AND YOUR COMPLAINT BEING SUCHAS MAY CARRY YOU OFF SUDDEN AND PEOPLE WHO ARE NO MORE FEATHERSTONESTHAN THE MERRYANDREW AT THE FAIR OPENLY RECKONING ON YOUR PROPERTYCOMING TO THEM. AND ME YOUR OWN SISTER AND SOLOMON YOUR OWN BROTHERAND IF THATS TO BE IT WHAT HAS IT PLEASED THE ALMIGHTY TO MAKEFAMILIES FOR HERE MRS.

YOUMEAN TO SAY FRED VINCY HAS BEEN GETTING SOMEBODY TO ADVANCE HIM MONEYON WHAT HE SAYS HE KNOWS ABOUT MY WILL EHI NEVER SAID SO BROTHER MRS. WAULES VOICE HAD AGAIN BECOME DRY ANDUNSHAKEN. IT WAS TOLD ME BY MY BROTHER SOLOMON LAST NIGHT WHEN HECALLED COMING FROM MARKET TO GIVE ME ADVICE ABOUT THE OLD WHEAT MEBEING A WIDOW AND MY SON JOHN ONLY THREEANDTWENTY THOUGH STEADYBEYOND ANYTHING. AND HE HAD IT FROM MOST UNDENIABLE AUTHORITY AND NOTONE BUT MANY.STUFF AND NONSENSE I DONT BELIEVE A WORD OF IT. ITS ALL A GOTUPSTORY. GO TO THE WINDOW MISSY I THOUGHT I HEARD A HORSE. SEE IF THEDOCTORS COMING.NOT GOT UP BY ME BROTHER NOR YET BY SOLOMON WHO WHATEVER ELSE HEMAY BEAND I DONT DENY HE HAS ODDITIESHAS MADE HIS WILL AND PARTEDHIS PROPERTY EQUAL BETWEEN SUCH KIN AS HES FRIENDS WITH THOUGH FORMY PART I THINK THERE ARE TIMES WHEN SOME SHOULD BE CONSIDERED MORETHAN OTHERS. BUT SOLOMON MAKES IT NO SECRET WHAT HE MEANS TO DO.THE MORE FOOL HE SAID MR. FEATHERSTONE WITH SOME DIFFICULTYBREAKING INTO A SEVERE FIT OF COUGHING THAT REQUIRED MARY GARTH TOSTAND NEAR HIM SO THAT SHE DID NOT FIND OUT WHOSE HORSES THEY WEREWHICH PRESENTLY PAUSED STAMPING ON THE GRAVEL BEFORE THE DOOR.BEFORE MR. FEATHERSTONES COUGH WAS QUIET ROSAMOND ENTERED BEARING UPHER RIDINGHABIT WITH MUCH GRACE. SHE BOWED CEREMONIOUSLY TO MRS.WAULE WHO SAID STIFFLY HOW DO YOU DO MISS SMILED AND NODDEDSILENTLY TO MARY AND REMAINED STANDING TILL THE COUGHING SHOULD CEASEAND ALLOW HER UNCLE TO NOTICE HER.HEYDAY MISS HE SAID AT LAST YOU HAVE A FINE COLOR. WHERES FREDSEEING ABOUT THE HORSES. HE WILL BE IN PRESENTLY.SIT DOWN SIT DOWN. MRS. WAULE YOUD BETTER GO.EVEN THOSE NEIGHBORS WHO HAD CALLED PETER FEATHERSTONE AN OLD FOX HADNEVER ACCUSED HIM OF BEING INSINCERELY POLITE AND HIS SISTER WAS QUITEUSED TO THE PECULIAR ABSENCE OF CEREMONY WITH WHICH HE MARKED HIS SENSEOF BLOODRELATIONSHIP. INDEED SHE HERSELF WAS ACCUSTOMED TO THINK THATENTIRE FREEDOM FROM THE NECESSITY OF BEHAVING AGREEABLY WAS INCLUDED INTHE ALMIGHTYS INTENTIONS ABOUT FAMILIES. SHE ROSE SLOWLY WITHOUT ANYSIGN OF RESENTMENT AND SAID IN HER USUAL MUFFLED MONOTONE BROTHER IHOPE THE NEW DOCTOR WILL BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU. SOLOMON SAYSTHERES GREAT TALK OF HIS CLEVERNESS. IM SURE ITS MY WISH YOU SHOULDBE SPARED. AND THERES NONE MORE READY TO NURSE YOU THAN YOUR OWNSISTER AND YOUR OWN NIECES IF YOUD ONLY SAY THE WORD. THERESREBECCA AND JOANNA AND ELIZABETH YOU KNOW.AY AY I REMEMBERYOULL SEE IVE REMEMBERED EM ALLALL DARK ANDUGLY. THEYD NEED HAVE SOME MONEY EH THERE NEVER WAS ANY BEAUTY INTHE WOMEN OF OUR FAMILY BUT THE FEATHERSTONES HAVE ALWAYS HAD SOMEMONEY AND THE WAULES TOO. WAULE HAD MONEY TOO. A WARM MAN WAS WAULE.AY AY MONEYS A GOOD EGG AND IF YOUVE GOT MONEY TO LEAVE BEHINDYOU LAY IT IN A WARM NEST. GOODBY MRS. WAULE. HERE MR. FEATHERSTONEPULLED AT BOTH SIDES OF HIS WIG AS IF HE WANTED TO DEAFEN HIMSELF ANDHIS SISTER WENT AWAY RUMINATING ON THIS ORACULAR SPEECH OF HIS.NOTWITHSTANDING HER JEALOUSY OF THE VINCYS AND OF MARY GARTH THEREREMAINED AS THE NETHERMOST SEDIMENT IN HER MENTAL SHALLOWS A PERSUASIONTHAT HER BROTHER PETER FEATHERSTONE COULD NEVER LEAVE HIS CHIEFPROPERTY AWAY FROM HIS BLOODRELATIONSELSE WHY HAD THE ALMIGHTYCARRIED OFF HIS TWO WIVES BOTH CHILDLESS AFTER HE HAD GAINED SO MUCHBY MANGANESE AND THINGS TURNING UP WHEN NOBODY EXPECTED ITAND WHYWAS THERE A LOWICK PARISH CHURCH AND THE WAULES AND POWDERELLS ALLSITTING IN THE SAME PEW FOR GENERATIONS AND THE FEATHERSTONE PEW NEXTTO THEM IF THE SUNDAY AFTER HER BROTHER PETERS DEATH EVERYBODY WASTO KNOW THAT THE PROPERTY WAS GONE OUT OF THE FAMILY THE HUMAN MINDHAS AT NO PERIOD ACCEPTED A MORAL CHAOS AND SO PREPOSTEROUS A RESULTWAS NOT STRICTLY CONCEIVABLE. BUT WE ARE FRIGHTENED AT MUCH THAT IS NOTSTRICTLY CONCEIVABLE.WHEN FRED CAME IN THE OLD MAN EYED HIM WITH A PECULIAR TWINKLE WHICHTHE YOUNGER HAD OFTEN HAD REASON TO INTERPRET AS PRIDE IN THESATISFACTORY DETAILS OF HIS APPEARANCE.YOU TWO MISSES GO AWAY SAID MR. FEATHERSTONE. I WANT TO SPEAK TOFRED.COME INTO MY ROOM ROSAMOND YOU WILL NOT MIND THE COLD FOR A LITTLEWHILE SAID MARY. THE TWO GIRLS HAD NOT ONLY KNOWN EACH OTHER INCHILDHOOD BUT HAD BEEN AT THE SAME PROVINCIAL SCHOOL TOGETHER MARY ASAN ARTICLED PUPIL SO THAT THEY HAD MANY MEMORIES IN COMMON AND LIKEDVERY WELL TO TALK IN PRIVATE. INDEED THIS TTETTE WAS ONE OFROSAMONDS OBJECTS IN COMING TO STONE COURT.OLD FEATHERSTONE WOULD NOT BEGIN THE DIALOGUE TILL THE DOOR HAD BEENCLOSED. HE CONTINUED TO LOOK AT FRED WITH THE SAME TWINKLE AND WITH ONEOF HIS HABITUAL GRIMACES ALTERNATELY SCREWING AND WIDENING HIS MOUTHAND WHEN HE SPOKE IT WAS IN A LOW TONE WHICH MIGHT BE TAKEN FOR THATOF AN INFORMER READY TO BE BOUGHT OFF RATHER THAN FOR THE TONE OF ANOFFENDED SENIOR. HE WAS NOT A MAN TO FEEL ANY STRONG MORAL INDIGNATIONEVEN ON ACCOUNT OF TRESPASSES AGAINST HIMSELF. IT WAS NATURAL THATOTHERS SHOULD WANT TO GET AN ADVANTAGE OVER HIM BUT THEN HE WAS ALITTLE TOO CUNNING FOR THEM.SO SIR YOUVE BEEN PAYING TEN PER CENT FOR MONEY WHICH YOUVEPROMISED TO PAY OFF BY MORTGAGING MY LAND WHEN IM DEAD AND GONE EHYOU PUT MY LIFE AT A TWELVEMONTH SAY. BUT I CAN ALTER MY WILL YET.FRED BLUSHED. HE HAD NOT BORROWED MONEY IN THAT WAY FOR EXCELLENTREASONS. BUT HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF HAVING SPOKEN WITH SOME CONFIDENCEPERHAPS WITH MORE THAN HE EXACTLY REMEMBERED ABOUT HIS PROSPECT OFGETTING FEATHERSTONES LAND AS A FUTURE MEANS OF PAYING PRESENT DEBTS.I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU REFER TO SIR. I HAVE CERTAINLY NEVER BORROWEDANY MONEY ON SUCH AN INSECURITY. PLEASE DO EXPLAIN.NO SIR ITS YOU MUST EXPLAIN. I CAN ALTER MY WILL YET LET ME TELLYOU. IM OF SOUND MINDCAN RECKON COMPOUND INTEREST IN MY HEAD ANDREMEMBER EVERY FOOLS NAME AS WELL AS I COULD TWENTY YEARS AGO. WHATTHE DEUCE IM UNDER EIGHTY. I SAY YOU MUST CONTRADICT THIS STORY.I HAVE CONTRADICTED IT SIR FRED ANSWERED WITH A TOUCH OFIMPATIENCE NOT REMEMBERING THAT HIS UNCLE DID NOT VERBALLYDISCRIMINATE CONTRADICTING FROM DISPROVING THOUGH NO ONE WAS FURTHERFROM CONFOUNDING THE TWO IDEAS THAN OLD FEATHERSTONE WHO OFTENWONDERED THAT SO MANY FOOLS TOOK HIS OWN ASSERTIONS FOR PROOFS. BUT ICONTRADICT IT AGAIN. THE STORY IS A SILLY LIE.NONSENSE YOU MUST BRING DOCKIMENTS. IT COMES FROM AUTHORITY.NAME THE AUTHORITY AND MAKE HIM NAME THE MAN OF WHOM I BORROWED THEMONEY AND THEN I CAN DISPROVE THE STORY.ITS PRETTY GOOD AUTHORITY I THINKA MAN WHO KNOWS MOST OF WHAT GOESON IN MIDDLEMARCH. ITS THAT FINE RELIGIOUS CHARITABLE UNCLE OYOURS. COME NOW HERE MR. FEATHERSTONE HAD HIS PECULIAR INWARD SHAKEWHICH SIGNIFIED MERRIMENT.MR. BULSTRODEWHO ELSE EHTHEN THE STORY HAS GROWN INTO THIS LIE OUT OF SOME SERMONIZING WORDSHE MAY HAVE LET FALL ABOUT ME. DO THEY PRETEND THAT HE NAMED THE MANWHO LENT ME THE MONEYIF THERE IS SUCH A MAN DEPEND UPON IT BULSTRODE KNOWS HIM. BUTSUPPOSING YOU ONLY TRIED TO GET THE MONEY LENT AND DIDNT GETITBULSTRODE UD KNOW THAT TOO. YOU BRING ME A WRITING FROM BULSTRODETO SAY HE DOESNT BELIEVE YOUVE EVER PROMISED TO PAY YOUR DEBTS OUT OMY LAND. COME NOWMR. FEATHERSTONES FACE REQUIRED ITS WHOLE SCALE OF GRIMACES AS AMUSCULAR OUTLET TO HIS SILENT TRIUMPH IN THE SOUNDNESS OF HISFACULTIES.FRED FELT HIMSELF TO BE IN A DISGUSTING DILEMMA.YOU MUST BE JOKING SIR. MR. BULSTRODE LIKE OTHER MEN BELIEVESSCORES OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT TRUE AND HE HAS A PREJUDICE AGAINST ME.I COULD EASILY GET HIM TO WRITE THAT HE KNEW NO FACTS IN PROOF OF THEREPORT YOU SPEAK OF THOUGH IT MIGHT LEAD TO UNPLEASANTNESS. BUT ICOULD HARDLY ASK HIM TO WRITE DOWN WHAT HE BELIEVES OR DOES NOT BELIEVEABOUT ME. FRED PAUSED AN INSTANT AND THEN ADDED IN POLITIC APPEAL TOHIS UNCLES VANITY THAT IS HARDLY A THING FOR A GENTLEMAN TO ASK.BUT HE WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE RESULT.AY I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. YOUD SOONER OFFEND ME THAN BULSTRODE. ANDWHATS HEHES GOT NO LAND HEREABOUT THAT EVER I HEARD TELL OF. ASPECKILATING FELLOW HE MAY COME DOWN ANY DAY WHEN THE DEVIL LEAVESOFF BACKING HIM. AND THATS WHAT HIS RELIGION MEANS HE WANTS GODAMIGHTY TO COME IN. THATS NONSENSE THERES ONE THING I MADE OUTPRETTY CLEAR WHEN I USED TO GO TO CHURCHAND ITS THIS GOD AMIGHTYSTICKS TO THE LAND. HE PROMISES LAND AND HE GIVES LAND AND HE MAKESCHAPS RICH WITH CORN AND CATTLE. BUT YOU TAKE THE OTHER SIDE. YOU LIKEBULSTRODE AND SPECKILATION BETTER THAN FEATHERSTONE AND LAND.I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR SAID FRED RISING STANDING WITH HIS BACK TOTHE FIRE AND BEATING HIS BOOT WITH HIS WHIP. I LIKE NEITHER BULSTRODENOR SPECULATION. HE SPOKE RATHER SULKILY FEELING HIMSELF STALEMATED.WELL WELL YOU CAN DO WITHOUT ME THATS PRETTY CLEAR SAID OLDFEATHERSTONE SECRETLY DISLIKING THE POSSIBILITY THAT FRED WOULD SHOWHIMSELF AT ALL INDEPENDENT. YOU NEITHER WANT A BIT OF LAND TO MAKE ASQUIRE OF YOU INSTEAD OF A STARVING PARSON NOR A LIFT OF A HUNDREDPOUND BY THE WAY. ITS ALL ONE TO ME. I CAN MAKE FIVE CODICILS IF ILIKE AND I SHALL KEEP MY BANKNOTES FOR A NESTEGG. ITS ALL ONE TOME.FRED COLORED AGAIN. FEATHERSTONE HAD RARELY GIVEN HIM PRESENTS OFMONEY AND AT THIS MOMENT IT SEEMED ALMOST HARDER TO PART WITH THEIMMEDIATE PROSPECT OF BANKNOTES THAN WITH THE MORE DISTANT PROSPECT OFTHE LAND.I AM NOT UNGRATEFUL SIR. I NEVER MEANT TO SHOW DISREGARD FOR ANY KINDINTENTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE TOWARDS ME. ON THE CONTRARY.VERY GOOD. THEN PROVE IT. YOU BRING ME A LETTER FROM BULSTRODE SAYINGHE DOESNT BELIEVE YOUVE BEEN CRACKING AND PROMISING TO PAY YOUR DEBTSOUT O MY LAND AND THEN IF THERES ANY SCRAPE YOUVE GOT INTO WELLSEE IF I CANT BACK YOU A BIT. COME NOW THATS A BARGAIN. HERE GIVEME YOUR ARM. ILL TRY AND WALK ROUND THE ROOM.FRED IN SPITE OF HIS IRRITATION HAD KINDNESS ENOUGH IN HIM TO BE ALITTLE SORRY FOR THE UNLOVED UNVENERATED OLD MAN WHO WITH HISDROPSICAL LEGS LOOKED MORE THAN USUALLY PITIABLE IN WALKING. WHILEGIVING HIS ARM HE THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD NOT HIMSELF LIKE TO BE AN OLDFELLOW WITH HIS CONSTITUTION BREAKING UP AND HE WAITEDGOODTEMPEREDLY FIRST BEFORE THE WINDOW TO HEAR THE WONTED REMARKSABOUT THE GUINEAFOWLS AND THE WEATHERCOCK AND THEN BEFORE THE SCANTYBOOKSHELVES OF WHICH THE CHIEF GLORIES IN DARK CALF WERE JOSEPHUSCULPEPPER KLOPSTOCKS MESSIAH AND SEVERAL VOLUMES OF THEGENTLEMANS MAGAZINE.READ ME THE NAMES O THE BOOKS. COME NOW YOURE A COLLEGE MAN.FRED GAVE HIM THE TITLES.WHAT DID MISSY WANT WITH MORE BOOKS WHAT MUST YOU BE BRINGING HERMORE BOOKS FORTHEY AMUSE HER SIR. SHE IS VERY FOND OF READING.A LITTLE TOO FOND SAID MR. FEATHERSTONE CAPTIOUSLY. SHE WAS FORREADING WHEN SHE SAT WITH ME. BUT I PUT A STOP TO THAT. SHES GOT THENEWSPAPER TO READ OUT LOUD. THATS ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY I SHOULD THINK.I CANT ABIDE TO SEE HER READING TO HERSELF. YOU MIND AND NOT BRING HERANY MORE BOOKS DO YOU HEARYES SIR I HEAR. FRED HAD RECEIVED THIS ORDER BEFORE AND HADSECRETLY DISOBEYED IT. HE INTENDED TO DISOBEY IT AGAIN.RING THE BELL SAID MR. FEATHERSTONE I WANT MISSY TO COME DOWN.ROSAMOND AND MARY HAD BEEN TALKING FASTER THAN THEIR MALE FRIENDS. THEYDID NOT THINK OF SITTING DOWN BUT STOOD AT THE TOILETTABLE NEAR THEWINDOW WHILE ROSAMOND TOOK OFF HER HAT ADJUSTED HER VEIL AND APPLIEDLITTLE TOUCHES OF HER FINGERTIPS TO HER HAIRHAIR OF INFANTINEFAIRNESS NEITHER FLAXEN NOR YELLOW. MARY GARTH SEEMED ALL THE PLAINERSTANDING AT AN ANGLE BETWEEN THE TWO NYMPHSTHE ONE IN THE GLASS ANDTHE ONE OUT OF IT WHO LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH EYES OF HEAVENLY BLUEDEEP ENOUGH TO HOLD THE MOST EXQUISITE MEANINGS AN INGENIOUS BEHOLDERCOULD PUT INTO THEM AND DEEP ENOUGH TO HIDE THE MEANINGS OF THE OWNERIF THESE SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE LESS EXQUISITE. ONLY A FEW CHILDREN INMIDDLEMARCH LOOKED BLOND BY THE SIDE OF ROSAMOND AND THE SLIM FIGUREDISPLAYED BY HER RIDINGHABIT HAD DELICATE UNDULATIONS. IN FACT MOSTMEN IN MIDDLEMARCH EXCEPT HER BROTHERS HELD THAT MISS VINCY WAS THEBEST GIRL IN THE WORLD AND SOME CALLED HER AN ANGEL. MARY GARTH ONTHE CONTRARY HAD THE ASPECT OF AN ORDINARY SINNER SHE WAS BROWN HERCURLY DARK HAIR WAS ROUGH AND STUBBORN HER STATURE WAS LOW AND ITWOULD NOT BE TRUE TO DECLARE IN SATISFACTORY ANTITHESIS THAT SHE HADALL THE VIRTUES. PLAINNESS HAS ITS PECULIAR TEMPTATIONS AND VICES QUITEAS MUCH AS BEAUTY IT IS APT EITHER TO FEIGN AMIABILITY OR NOTFEIGNING IT TO SHOW ALL THE REPULSIVENESS OF DISCONTENT AT ANY RATETO BE CALLED AN UGLY THING IN CONTRAST WITH THAT LOVELY CREATURE YOURCOMPANION IS APT TO PRODUCE SOME EFFECT BEYOND A SENSE OF FINEVERACITY AND FITNESS IN THE PHRASE. AT THE AGE OF TWOANDTWENTY MARYHAD CERTAINLY NOT ATTAINED THAT PERFECT GOOD SENSE AND GOOD PRINCIPLEWHICH ARE USUALLY RECOMMENDED TO THE LESS FORTUNATE GIRL AS IF THEYWERE TO BE OBTAINED IN QUANTITIES READY MIXED WITH A FLAVOR OFRESIGNATION AS REQUIRED. HER SHREWDNESS HAD A STREAK OF SATIRICBITTERNESS CONTINUALLY RENEWED AND NEVER CARRIED UTTERLY OUT OF SIGHTEXCEPT BY A STRONG CURRENT OF GRATITUDE TOWARDS THOSE WHO INSTEAD OFTELLING HER THAT SHE OUGHT TO BE CONTENTED DID SOMETHING TO MAKE HERSO. ADVANCING WOMANHOOD HAD TEMPERED HER PLAINNESS WHICH WAS OF A GOODHUMAN SORT SUCH AS THE MOTHERS OF OUR RACE HAVE VERY COMMONLY WORN INALL LATITUDES UNDER A MORE OR LESS BECOMING HEADGEAR. REMBRANDT WOULDHAVE PAINTED HER WITH PLEASURE AND WOULD HAVE MADE HER BROAD FEATURESLOOK OUT OF THE CANVAS WITH INTELLIGENT HONESTY. FOR HONESTYTRUTHTELLING FAIRNESS WAS MARYS REIGNING VIRTUE SHE NEITHER TRIEDTO CREATE ILLUSIONS NOR INDULGED IN THEM FOR HER OWN BEHOOF AND WHENSHE WAS IN A GOOD MOOD SHE HAD HUMOR ENOUGH IN HER TO LAUGH AT HERSELF.WHEN SHE AND ROSAMOND HAPPENED BOTH TO BE REFLECTED IN THE GLASS SHESAID LAUGHINGLYWHAT A BROWN PATCH I AM BY THE SIDE OF YOU ROSY YOU ARE THE MOSTUNBECOMING COMPANION.OH NO NO ONE THINKS OF YOUR APPEARANCE YOU ARE SO SENSIBLE ANDUSEFUL MARY. BEAUTY IS OF VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE IN REALITY SAIDROSAMOND TURNING HER HEAD TOWARDS MARY BUT WITH EYES SWERVING TOWARDSTHE NEW VIEW OF HER NECK IN THE GLASS.YOU MEAN MY BEAUTY SAID MARY RATHER SARDONICALLY.ROSAMOND THOUGHT POOR MARY SHE TAKES THE KINDEST THINGS ILL. ALOUDSHE SAID WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING LATELYI OH MINDING THE HOUSEPOURING OUT SYRUPPRETENDING TO BE AMIABLEAND CONTENTEDLEARNING TO HAVE A BAD OPINION OF EVERYBODY.IT IS A WRETCHED LIFE FOR YOU.NO SAID MARY CURTLY WITH A LITTLE TOSS OF HER HEAD. I THINK MYLIFE IS PLEASANTER THAN YOUR MISS MORGANS.YES BUT MISS MORGAN IS SO UNINTERESTING AND NOT YOUNG.SHE IS INTERESTING TO HERSELF I SUPPOSE AND I AM NOT AT ALL SURETHAT EVERYTHING GETS EASIER AS ONE GETS OLDER.NO SAID ROSAMOND REFLECTIVELY ONE WONDERS WHAT SUCH PEOPLE DOWITHOUT ANY PROSPECT. TO BE SURE THERE IS RELIGION AS A SUPPORT. BUTSHE ADDED DIMPLING IT IS VERY DIFFERENT WITH YOU MARY. YOU MAY HAVEAN OFFER.HAS ANY ONE TOLD YOU HE MEANS TO MAKE ME ONEOF COURSE NOT. I MEAN THERE IS A GENTLEMAN WHO MAY FALL IN LOVE WITHYOU SEEING YOU ALMOST EVERY DAY.A CERTAIN CHANGE IN MARYS FACE WAS CHIEFLY DETERMINED BY THE RESOLVENOT TO SHOW ANY CHANGE.DOES THAT ALWAYS MAKE PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE SHE ANSWERED CARELESSLYIT SEEMS TO ME QUITE AS OFTEN A REASON FOR DETESTING EACH OTHER.NOT WHEN THEY ARE INTERESTING AND AGREEABLE. I HEAR THAT MR. LYDGATEIS BOTH.OH MR. LYDGATE SAID MARY WITH AN UNMISTAKABLE LAPSE INTOINDIFFERENCE. YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT HIM SHE ADDED NOTCHOOSING TO INDULGE ROSAMONDS INDIRECTNESS.MERELY HOW YOU LIKE HIM.THERE IS NO QUESTION OF LIKING AT PRESENT. MY LIKING ALWAYS WANTS SOMELITTLE KINDNESS TO KINDLE IT. I AM NOT MAGNANIMOUS ENOUGH TO LIKEPEOPLE WHO SPEAK TO ME WITHOUT SEEMING TO SEE ME.IS HE SO HAUGHTY SAID ROSAMOND WITH HEIGHTENED SATISFACTION. YOUKNOW THAT HE IS OF GOOD FAMILYNO HE DID NOT GIVE THAT AS A REASON.MARY YOU ARE THE ODDEST GIRL. BUT WHAT SORT OF LOOKING MAN IS HEDESCRIBE HIM TO ME.HOW CAN ONE DESCRIBE A MAN I CAN GIVE YOU AN INVENTORY HEAVYEYEBROWS DARK EYES A STRAIGHT NOSE THICK DARK HAIR LARGE SOLIDWHITE HANDSANDLET ME SEEOH AN EXQUISITE CAMBRICPOCKETHANDKERCHIEF. BUT YOU WILL SEE HIM. YOU KNOW THIS IS ABOUT THETIME OF HIS VISITS.ROSAMOND BLUSHED A LITTLE BUT SAID MEDITATIVELY I RATHER LIKE AHAUGHTY MANNER. I CANNOT ENDURE A RATTLING YOUNG MAN.I DID NOT TELL YOU THAT MR. LYDGATE WAS HAUGHTY BUT IL Y EN A POURTOUS LES GOTS AS LITTLE MAMSELLE USED TO SAY AND IF ANY GIRL CANCHOOSE THE PARTICULAR SORT OF CONCEIT SHE WOULD LIKE I SHOULD THINK ITIS YOU ROSY.HAUGHTINESS IS NOT CONCEIT I CALL FRED CONCEITED.I WISH NO ONE SAID ANY WORSE OF HIM. HE SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL. MRS.WAULE HAS BEEN TELLING UNCLE THAT FRED IS VERY UNSTEADY. MARY SPOKEFROM A GIRLISH IMPULSE WHICH GOT THE BETTER OF HER JUDGMENT. THERE WASA VAGUE UNEASINESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD UNSTEADY WHICH SHE HOPEDROSAMOND MIGHT SAY SOMETHING TO DISSIPATE. BUT SHE PURPOSELY ABSTAINEDFROM MENTIONING MRS. WAULES MORE SPECIAL INSINUATION.OH FRED IS HORRID SAID ROSAMOND. SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED HERSELFSO UNSUITABLE A WORD TO ANY ONE BUT MARY.WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY HORRIDHE IS SO IDLE AND MAKES PAPA SO ANGRY AND SAYS HE WILL NOT TAKEORDERS.I THINK FRED IS QUITE RIGHT.HOW CAN YOU SAY HE IS QUITE RIGHT MARY I THOUGHT YOU HAD MORE SENSEOF RELIGION.HE IS NOT FIT TO BE A CLERGYMAN.BUT HE OUGHT TO BE FIT.WELL THEN HE IS NOT WHAT HE OUGHT TO BE. IKNOW SOME OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE SAME CASE.BUT NO ONE APPROVES OF THEM. I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO MARRY A CLERGYMANBUT THERE MUST BE CLERGYMEN.IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT FRED MUST BE ONE.BUT WHEN PAPA HAS BEEN AT THE EXPENSE OF EDUCATING HIM FOR IT ANDONLY SUPPOSE IF HE SHOULD HAVE NO FORTUNE LEFT HIMI CAN SUPPOSE THAT VERY WELL SAID MARY DRYLY.THEN I WONDER YOU CAN DEFEND FRED SAID ROSAMOND INCLINED TO PUSHTHIS POINT.I DONT DEFEND HIM SAID MARY LAUGHING I WOULD DEFEND ANY PARISHFROM HAVING HIM FOR A CLERGYMAN.BUT OF COURSE IF HE WERE A CLERGYMAN HE MUST BE DIFFERENT.YES HE WOULD BE A GREAT HYPOCRITE AND HE IS NOT THAT YET.IT IS OF NO USE SAYING ANYTHING TO YOU MARY. YOU ALWAYS TAKE FREDSPART.WHY SHOULD I NOT TAKE HIS PART SAID MARY LIGHTING UP. HE WOULDTAKE MINE. HE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO TAKES THE LEAST TROUBLE TO OBLIGEME.YOU MAKE ME FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE MARY SAID ROSAMOND WITH HERGRAVEST MILDNESS I WOULD NOT TELL MAMMA FOR THE WORLD.WHAT WOULD YOU NOT TELL HER SAID MARY ANGRILY.PRAY DO NOT GO INTO A RAGE MARY SAID ROSAMOND MILDLY AS EVER.IF YOUR MAMMA IS AFRAID THAT FRED WILL MAKE ME AN OFFER TELL HER THATI WOULD NOT MARRY HIM IF HE ASKED ME. BUT HE IS NOT GOING TO DO SOTHAT I AM AWARE. HE CERTAINLY NEVER HAS ASKED ME.MARY YOU ARE ALWAYS SO VIOLENT.AND YOU ARE ALWAYS SO EXASPERATING.I WHAT CAN YOU BLAME ME FOROH BLAMELESS PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS THE MOST EXASPERATING. THERE IS THEBELLI THINK WE MUST GO DOWN.I DID NOT MEAN TO QUARREL SAID ROSAMOND PUTTING ON HER HAT.QUARREL NONSENSE WE HAVE NOT QUARRELLED. IF ONE IS NOT TO GET INTO ARAGE SOMETIMES WHAT IS THE GOOD OF BEING FRIENDSAM I TO REPEAT WHAT YOU HAVE SAIDJUST AS YOU PLEASE. I NEVER SAY WHAT I AM AFRAID OF HAVING REPEATED.BUT LET US GO DOWN.MR. LYDGATE WAS RATHER LATE THIS MORNING BUT THE VISITORS STAYED LONGENOUGH TO SEE HIM FOR MR. FEATHERSTONE ASKED ROSAMOND TO SING TO HIMAND SHE HERSELF WAS SO KIND AS TO PROPOSE A SECOND FAVORITE SONG OFHISFLOW ON THOU SHINING RIVERAFTER SHE HAD SUNG HOME SWEET HOMEWHICH SHE DETESTED. THIS HARDHEADED OLD OVERREACH APPROVED OF THESENTIMENTAL SONG AS THE SUITABLE GARNISH FOR GIRLS AND ALSO ASFUNDAMENTALLY FINE SENTIMENT BEING THE RIGHT THING FOR A SONG.MR. FEATHERSTONE WAS STILL APPLAUDING THE LAST PERFORMANCE ANDASSURING MISSY THAT HER VOICE WAS AS CLEAR AS A BLACKBIRDS WHEN MR.LYDGATES HORSE PASSED THE WINDOW.HIS DULL EXPECTATION OF THE USUAL DISAGREEABLE ROUTINE WITH AN AGEDPATIENTWHO CAN HARDLY BELIEVE THAT MEDICINE WOULD NOT SET HIM UP IFTHE DOCTOR WERE ONLY CLEVER ENOUGHADDED TO HIS GENERAL DISBELIEF INMIDDLEMARCH CHARMS MADE A DOUBLY EFFECTIVE BACKGROUND TO THIS VISIONOF ROSAMOND WHOM OLD FEATHERSTONE MADE HASTE OSTENTATIOUSLY TOINTRODUCE AS HIS NIECE THOUGH HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT IT WORTH WHILE TOSPEAK OF MARY GARTH IN THAT LIGHT. NOTHING ESCAPED LYDGATE INROSAMONDS GRACEFUL BEHAVIOR HOW DELICATELY SHE WAIVED THE NOTICEWHICH THE OLD MANS WANT OF TASTE HAD THRUST UPON HER BY A QUIETGRAVITY NOT SHOWING HER DIMPLES ON THE WRONG OCCASION BUT SHOWINGTHEM AFTERWARDS IN SPEAKING TO MARY TO WHOM SHE ADDRESSED HERSELF WITHSO MUCH GOODNATURED INTEREST THAT LYDGATE AFTER QUICKLY EXAMININGMARY MORE FULLY THAN HE HAD DONE BEFORE SAW AN ADORABLE KINDNESS INROSAMONDS EYES. BUT MARY FROM SOME CAUSE LOOKED RATHER OUT OF TEMPER.MISS ROSY HAS BEEN SINGING ME A SONGYOUVE NOTHING TO SAY AGAINSTTHAT EH DOCTOR SAID MR. FEATHERSTONE. I LIKE IT BETTER THAN YOURPHYSIC.THAT HAS MADE ME FORGET HOW THE TIME WAS GOING SAID ROSAMOND RISINGTO REACH HER HAT WHICH SHE HAD LAID ASIDE BEFORE SINGING SO THAT HERFLOWERLIKE HEAD ON ITS WHITE STEM WAS SEEN IN PERFECTION ABOVE HERRIDINGHABIT. FRED WE MUST REALLY GO.VERY GOOD SAID FRED WHO HAD HIS OWN REASONS FOR NOT BEING IN THEBEST SPIRITS AND WANTED TO GET AWAY.MISS VINCY IS A MUSICIAN SAID LYDGATE FOLLOWING HER WITH HIS EYES.EVERY NERVE AND MUSCLE IN ROSAMOND WAS ADJUSTED TO THE CONSCIOUSNESSTHAT SHE WAS BEING LOOKED AT. SHE WAS BY NATURE AN ACTRESS OF PARTSTHAT ENTERED INTO HER PHYSIQUE SHE EVEN ACTED HER OWN CHARACTER ANDSO WELL THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW IT TO BE PRECISELY HER OWN.THE BEST IN MIDDLEMARCH ILL BE BOUND SAID MR. FEATHERSTONE LETTHE NEXT BE WHO SHE WILL. EH FRED SPEAK UP FOR YOUR SISTER.IM AFRAID IM OUT OF COURT SIR. MY EVIDENCE WOULD BE GOOD FORNOTHING.MIDDLEMARCH HAS NOT A VERY HIGH STANDARD UNCLE SAID ROSAMOND WITHA PRETTY LIGHTNESS GOING TOWARDS HER WHIP WHICH LAY AT A DISTANCE.LYDGATE WAS QUICK IN ANTICIPATING HER. HE REACHED THE WHIP BEFORE SHEDID AND TURNED TO PRESENT IT TO HER. SHE BOWED AND LOOKED AT HIM HEOF COURSE WAS LOOKING AT HER AND THEIR EYES MET WITH THAT PECULIARMEETING WHICH IS NEVER ARRIVED AT BY EFFORT BUT SEEMS LIKE A SUDDENDIVINE CLEARANCE OF HAZE. I THINK LYDGATE TURNED A LITTLE PALER THANUSUAL BUT ROSAMOND BLUSHED DEEPLY AND FELT A CERTAIN ASTONISHMENT.AFTER THAT SHE WAS REALLY ANXIOUS TO GO AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT SORT OFSTUPIDITY HER UNCLE WAS TALKING OF WHEN SHE WENT TO SHAKE HANDS WITHHIM.YET THIS RESULT WHICH SHE TOOK TO BE A MUTUAL IMPRESSION CALLEDFALLING IN LOVE WAS JUST WHAT ROSAMOND HAD CONTEMPLATED BEFOREHAND.EVER SINCE THAT IMPORTANT NEW ARRIVAL IN MIDDLEMARCH SHE HAD WOVEN ALITTLE FUTURE OF WHICH SOMETHING LIKE THIS SCENE WAS THE NECESSARYBEGINNING. STRANGERS WHETHER WRECKED AND CLINGING TO A RAFT OR DULYESCORTED AND ACCOMPANIED BY PORTMANTEAUS HAVE ALWAYS HAD ACIRCUMSTANTIAL FASCINATION FOR THE VIRGIN MIND AGAINST WHICH NATIVEMERIT HAS URGED ITSELF IN VAIN. AND A STRANGER WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARYTO ROSAMONDS SOCIAL ROMANCE WHICH HAD ALWAYS TURNED ON A LOVER ANDBRIDEGROOM WHO WAS NOT A MIDDLEMARCHER AND WHO HAD NO CONNECTIONS ATALL LIKE HER OWN OF LATE INDEED THE CONSTRUCTION SEEMED TO DEMANDTHAT HE SHOULD SOMEHOW BE RELATED TO A BARONET. NOW THAT SHE AND THESTRANGER HAD MET REALITY PROVED MUCH MORE MOVING THAN ANTICIPATIONAND ROSAMOND COULD NOT DOUBT THAT THIS WAS THE GREAT EPOCH OF HER LIFE.SHE JUDGED OF HER OWN SYMPTOMS AS THOSE OF AWAKENING LOVE AND SHE HELDIT STILL MORE NATURAL THAT MR. LYDGATE SHOULD HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE ATFIRST SIGHT OF HER. THESE THINGS HAPPENED SO OFTEN AT BALLS AND WHYNOT BY THE MORNING LIGHT WHEN THE COMPLEXION SHOWED ALL THE BETTER FORIT ROSAMOND THOUGH NO OLDER THAN MARY WAS RATHER USED TO BEINGFALLEN IN LOVE WITH BUT SHE FOR HER PART HAD REMAINED INDIFFERENTAND FASTIDIOUSLY CRITICAL TOWARDS BOTH FRESH SPRIG AND FADED BACHELOR.AND HERE WAS MR. LYDGATE SUDDENLY CORRESPONDING TO HER IDEAL BEINGALTOGETHER FOREIGN TO MIDDLEMARCH CARRYING A CERTAIN AIR OFDISTINCTION CONGRUOUS WITH GOOD FAMILY AND POSSESSING CONNECTIONSWHICH OFFERED VISTAS OF THAT MIDDLECLASS HEAVEN RANK A MAN OFTALENT ALSO WHOM IT WOULD BE ESPECIALLY DELIGHTFUL TO ENSLAVE INFACT A MAN WHO HAD TOUCHED HER NATURE QUITE NEWLY AND BROUGHT A VIVIDINTEREST INTO HER LIFE WHICH WAS BETTER THAN ANY FANCIED MIGHTBESUCH AS SHE WAS IN THE HABIT OF OPPOSING TO THE ACTUAL.THUS IN RIDING HOME BOTH THE BROTHER AND THE SISTER WERE PREOCCUPIEDAND INCLINED TO BE SILENT. ROSAMOND WHOSE BASIS FOR HER STRUCTURE HADTHE USUAL AIRY SLIGHTNESS WAS OF REMARKABLY DETAILED AND REALISTICIMAGINATION WHEN THE FOUNDATION HAD BEEN ONCE PRESUPPOSED AND BEFORETHEY HAD RIDDEN A MILE SHE WAS FAR ON IN THE COSTUME AND INTRODUCTIONSOF HER WEDDED LIFE HAVING DETERMINED ON HER HOUSE IN MIDDLEMARCH ANDFORESEEN THE VISITS SHE WOULD PAY TO HER HUSBANDS HIGHBRED RELATIVESAT A DISTANCE WHOSE FINISHED MANNERS SHE COULD APPROPRIATE ASTHOROUGHLY AS SHE HAD DONE HER SCHOOL ACCOMPLISHMENTS PREPARINGHERSELF THUS FOR VAGUER ELEVATIONS WHICH MIGHT ULTIMATELY COME. THEREWAS NOTHING FINANCIAL STILL LESS SORDID IN HER PREVISIONS SHE CAREDABOUT WHAT WERE CONSIDERED REFINEMENTS AND NOT ABOUT THE MONEY THATWAS TO PAY FOR THEM.FREDS MIND ON THE OTHER HAND WAS BUSY WITH AN ANXIETY WHICH EVEN HISREADY HOPEFULNESS COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY QUELL. HE SAW NO WAY OF ELUDINGFEATHERSTONES STUPID DEMAND WITHOUT INCURRING CONSEQUENCES WHICH HELIKED LESS EVEN THAN THE TASK OF FULFILLING IT. HIS FATHER WAS ALREADYOUT OF HUMOR WITH HIM AND WOULD BE STILL MORE SO IF HE WERE THEOCCASION OF ANY ADDITIONAL COOLNESS BETWEEN HIS OWN FAMILY AND THEBULSTRODES. THEN HE HIMSELF HATED HAVING TO GO AND SPEAK TO HIS UNCLEBULSTRODE AND PERHAPS AFTER DRINKING WINE HE HAD SAID MANY FOOLISHTHINGS ABOUT FEATHERSTONES PROPERTY AND THESE HAD BEEN MAGNIFIED BYREPORT. FRED FELT THAT HE MADE A WRETCHED FIGURE AS A FELLOW WHOBRAGGED ABOUT EXPECTATIONS FROM A QUEER OLD MISER LIKE FEATHERSTONEAND WENT TO BEG FOR CERTIFICATES AT HIS BIDDING. BUTTHOSEEXPECTATIONS HE REALLY HAD THEM AND HE SAW NO AGREEABLE ALTERNATIVEIF HE GAVE THEM UP BESIDES HE HAD LATELY MADE A DEBT WHICH GALLED HIMEXTREMELY AND OLD FEATHERSTONE HAD ALMOST BARGAINED TO PAY IT OFF. THEWHOLE AFFAIR WAS MISERABLY SMALL HIS DEBTS WERE SMALL EVEN HISEXPECTATIONS WERE NOT ANYTHING SO VERY MAGNIFICENT. FRED HAD KNOWN MENTO WHOM HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED OF CONFESSING THE SMALLNESS OF HISSCRAPES. SUCH RUMINATIONS NATURALLY PRODUCED A STREAK OF MISANTHROPICBITTERNESS. TO BE BORN THE SON OF A MIDDLEMARCH MANUFACTURER ANDINEVITABLE HEIR TO NOTHING IN PARTICULAR WHILE SUCH MEN AS MAINWARINGAND VYANCERTAINLY LIFE WAS A POOR BUSINESS WHEN A SPIRITED YOUNGFELLOW WITH A GOOD APPETITE FOR THE BEST OF EVERYTHING HAD SO POOR ANOUTLOOK.IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO FRED THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF BULSTRODES NAMEIN THE MATTER WAS A FICTION OF OLD FEATHERSTONES NOR COULD THIS HAVEMADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO HIS POSITION. HE SAW PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT THE OLDMAN WANTED TO EXERCISE HIS POWER BY TORMENTING HIM A LITTLE AND ALSOPROBABLY TO GET SOME SATISFACTION OUT OF SEEING HIM ON UNPLEASANT TERMSWITH BULSTRODE. FRED FANCIED THAT HE SAW TO THE BOTTOM OF HIS UNCLEFEATHERSTONES SOUL THOUGH IN REALITY HALF WHAT HE SAW THERE WAS NOMORE THAN THE REFLEX OF HIS OWN INCLINATIONS. THE DIFFICULT TASK OFKNOWING ANOTHER SOUL IS NOT FOR YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHOSE CONSCIOUSNESS ISCHIEFLY MADE UP OF THEIR OWN WISHES.FREDS MAIN POINT OF DEBATE WITH HIMSELF WAS WHETHER HE SHOULD TELLHIS FATHER OR TRY TO GET THROUGH THE AFFAIR WITHOUT HIS FATHERSKNOWLEDGE. IT WAS PROBABLY MRS. WAULE WHO HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT HIMAND IF MARY GARTH HAD REPEATED MRS. WAULES REPORT TO ROSAMOND ITWOULD BE SURE TO REACH HIS FATHER WHO WOULD AS SURELY QUESTION HIMABOUT IT. HE SAID TO ROSAMOND AS THEY SLACKENED THEIR PACEROSY DID MARY TELL YOU THAT MRS. WAULE HAD SAID ANYTHING ABOUT MEYES INDEED SHE DID.WHATTHAT YOU WERE VERY UNSTEADY.WAS THAT ALLI SHOULD THINK THAT WAS ENOUGH FRED.YOU ARE SURE SHE SAID NO MOREMARY MENTIONED NOTHING ELSE. BUT REALLY FRED I THINK YOU OUGHT TO BEASHAMED.OH FUDGE DONT LECTURE ME. WHAT DID MARY SAY ABOUT ITI AM NOT OBLIGED TO TELL YOU. YOU CARE SO VERY MUCH WHAT MARY SAYSAND YOU ARE TOO RUDE TO ALLOW ME TO SPEAK.OF COURSE I CARE WHAT MARY SAYS. SHE IS THE BEST GIRL I KNOW.I SHOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT SHE WAS A GIRL TO FALL IN LOVE WITH.HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT MEN WOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH GIRLS NEVER KNOW.AT LEAST FRED LET ME ADVISE YOU NOT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER FORSHE SAYS SHE WOULD NOT MARRY YOU IF YOU ASKED HER.SHE MIGHT HAVE WAITED TILL I DID ASK HER.I KNEW IT WOULD NETTLE YOU FRED.NOT AT ALL. SHE WOULD NOT HAVE SAID SO IF YOU HAD NOT PROVOKED HER.BEFORE REACHING HOME FRED CONCLUDED THAT HE WOULD TELL THE WHOLEAFFAIR AS SIMPLY AS POSSIBLE TO HIS FATHER WHO MIGHT PERHAPS TAKE ONHIMSELF THE UNPLEASANT BUSINESS OF SPEAKING TO BULSTRODE.BOOK II.OLD AND YOUNG.CHAPTER XIII.ST GENT. HOW CLASS YOUR MANAS BETTER THAN THE MOST    OR SEEMING BETTER WORSE BENEATH THAT CLOAK    AS SAINT OR KNAVE PILGRIM OR HYPOCRITED GENT. NAY TELL ME HOW YOU CLASS YOUR WEALTH OF BOOKS    THE DRIFTED RELICS OF ALL TIME.    AS WELL SORT THEM AT ONCE BY SIZE AND LIVERY    VELLUM TALL COPIES AND THE COMMON CALF    WILL HARDLY COVER MORE DIVERSITY    THAN ALL YOUR LABELS CUNNINGLY DEVISED    TO CLASS YOUR UNREAD AUTHORS.IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM FRED MR. VINCY DETERMINED TOSPEAK WITH MR. BULSTRODE IN HIS PRIVATE ROOM AT THE BANK AT HALFPASTONE WHEN HE WAS USUALLY FREE FROM OTHER CALLERS. BUT A VISITOR HADCOME IN AT ONE OCLOCK AND MR. BULSTRODE HAD SO MUCH TO SAY TO HIMTHAT THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE OF THE INTERVIEW BEING OVER IN HALF ANHOUR. THE BANKERS SPEECH WAS FLUENT BUT IT WAS ALSO COPIOUS AND HEUSED UP AN APPRECIABLE AMOUNT OF TIME IN BRIEF MEDITATIVE PAUSES. DONOT IMAGINE HIS SICKLY ASPECT TO HAVE BEEN OF THE YELLOW BLACKHAIREDSORT HE HAD A PALE BLOND SKIN THIN GRAYBESPRINKLED BROWN HAIRLIGHTGRAY EYES AND A LARGE FOREHEAD. LOUD MEN CALLED HIS SUBDUED TONEAN UNDERTONE AND SOMETIMES IMPLIED THAT IT WAS INCONSISTENT WITHOPENNESS THOUGH THERE SEEMS TO BE NO REASON WHY A LOUD MAN SHOULD NOTBE GIVEN TO CONCEALMENT OF ANYTHING EXCEPT HIS OWN VOICE UNLESS IT CANBE SHOWN THAT HOLY WRIT HAS PLACED THE SEAT OF CANDOR IN THE LUNGS. MR.BULSTRODE HAD ALSO A DEFERENTIAL BENDING ATTITUDE IN LISTENING AND ANAPPARENTLY FIXED ATTENTIVENESS IN HIS EYES WHICH MADE THOSE PERSONS WHOTHOUGHT THEMSELVES WORTH HEARING INFER THAT HE WAS SEEKING THE UTMOSTIMPROVEMENT FROM THEIR DISCOURSE. OTHERS WHO EXPECTED TO MAKE NO GREATFIGURE DISLIKED THIS KIND OF MORAL LANTERN TURNED ON THEM. IF YOU ARENOT PROUD OF YOUR CELLAR THERE IS NO THRILL OF SATISFACTION IN SEEINGYOUR GUEST HOLD UP HIS WINEGLASS TO THE LIGHT AND LOOK JUDICIAL. SUCHJOYS ARE RESERVED FOR CONSCIOUS MERIT. HENCE MR. BULSTRODES CLOSEATTENTION WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO THE PUBLICANS AND SINNERS INMIDDLEMARCH IT WAS ATTRIBUTED BY SOME TO HIS BEING A PHARISEE AND BYOTHERS TO HIS BEING EVANGELICAL. LESS SUPERFICIAL REASONERS AMONG THEMWISHED TO KNOW WHO HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER WERE OBSERVING THATFIVEANDTWENTY YEARS AGO NOBODY HAD EVER HEARD OF A BULSTRODE INMIDDLEMARCH. TO HIS PRESENT VISITOR LYDGATE THE SCRUTINIZING LOOK WASA MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE HE SIMPLY FORMED AN UNFAVORABLE OPINION OFTHE BANKERS CONSTITUTION AND CONCLUDED THAT HE HAD AN EAGER INWARDLIFE WITH LITTLE ENJOYMENT OF TANGIBLE THINGS.I SHALL BE EXCEEDINGLY OBLIGED IF YOU WILL LOOK IN ON ME HEREOCCASIONALLY MR. LYDGATE THE BANKER OBSERVED AFTER A BRIEF PAUSE.IF AS I DARE TO HOPE I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF FINDING YOU A VALUABLECOADJUTOR IN THE INTERESTING MATTER OF HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT THERE WILLBE MANY QUESTIONS WHICH WE SHALL NEED TO DISCUSS IN PRIVATE. AS TO THENEW HOSPITAL WHICH IS NEARLY FINISHED I SHALL CONSIDER WHAT YOU HAVESAID ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF THE SPECIAL DESTINATION FOR FEVERS. THEDECISION WILL REST WITH ME FOR THOUGH LORD MEDLICOTE HAS GIVEN THELAND AND TIMBER FOR THE BUILDING HE IS NOT DISPOSED TO GIVE HISPERSONAL ATTENTION TO THE OBJECT.THERE ARE FEW THINGS BETTER WORTH THE PAINS IN A PROVINCIAL TOWN LIKETHIS SAID LYDGATE. A FINE FEVER HOSPITAL IN ADDITION TO THE OLDINFIRMARY MIGHT BE THE NUCLEUS OF A MEDICAL SCHOOL HERE WHEN ONCE WEGET OUR MEDICAL REFORMS AND WHAT WOULD DO MORE FOR MEDICAL EDUCATIONTHAN THE SPREAD OF SUCH SCHOOLS OVER THE COUNTRY A BORN PROVINCIAL MANWHO HAS A GRAIN OF PUBLIC SPIRIT AS WELL AS A FEW IDEAS SHOULD DO WHATHE CAN TO RESIST THE RUSH OF EVERYTHING THAT IS A LITTLE BETTER THANCOMMON TOWARDS LONDON. ANY VALID PROFESSIONAL AIMS MAY OFTEN FIND AFREER IF NOT A RICHER FIELD IN THE PROVINCES.ONE OF LYDGATES GIFTS WAS A VOICE HABITUALLY DEEP AND SONOROUS YETCAPABLE OF BECOMING VERY LOW AND GENTLE AT THE RIGHT MOMENT. ABOUT HISORDINARY BEARING THERE WAS A CERTAIN FLING A FEARLESS EXPECTATION OFSUCCESS A CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN POWERS AND INTEGRITY MUCH FORTIFIED BYCONTEMPT FOR PETTY OBSTACLES OR SEDUCTIONS OF WHICH HE HAD HAD NOEXPERIENCE. BUT THIS PROUD OPENNESS WAS MADE LOVABLE BY AN EXPRESSIONOF UNAFFECTED GOODWILL. MR. BULSTRODE PERHAPS LIKED HIM THE BETTER FORTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IN PITCH AND MANNERS HE CERTAINLY LIKEDHIM THE BETTER AS ROSAMOND DID FOR BEING A STRANGER IN MIDDLEMARCH.ONE CAN BEGIN SO MANY THINGS WITH A NEW PERSONEVEN BEGIN TO BE ABETTER MAN.I SHALL REJOICE TO FURNISH YOUR ZEAL WITH FULLER OPPORTUNITIES MR.BULSTRODE ANSWERED I MEAN BY CONFIDING TO YOU THE SUPERINTENDENCE OFMY NEW HOSPITAL SHOULD A MATURER KNOWLEDGE FAVOR THAT ISSUE FOR I AMDETERMINED THAT SO GREAT AN OBJECT SHALL NOT BE SHACKLED BY OUR TWOPHYSICIANS. INDEED I AM ENCOURAGED TO CONSIDER YOUR ADVENT TO THISTOWN AS A GRACIOUS INDICATION THAT A MORE MANIFEST BLESSING IS NOW TOBE AWARDED TO MY EFFORTS WHICH HAVE HITHERTO BEEN MUCH WITHSTOOD. WITHREGARD TO THE OLD INFIRMARY WE HAVE GAINED THE INITIAL POINTI MEANYOUR ELECTION. AND NOW I HOPE YOU WILL NOT SHRINK FROM INCURRING ACERTAIN AMOUNT OF JEALOUSY AND DISLIKE FROM YOUR PROFESSIONAL BRETHRENBY PRESENTING YOURSELF AS A REFORMER.I WILL NOT PROFESS BRAVERY SAID LYDGATE SMILING BUT I ACKNOWLEDGEA GOOD DEAL OF PLEASURE IN FIGHTING AND I SHOULD NOT CARE FOR MYPROFESSION IF I DID NOT BELIEVE THAT BETTER METHODS WERE TO BE FOUNDAND ENFORCED THERE AS WELL AS EVERYWHERE ELSE.THE STANDARD OF THAT PROFESSION IS LOW IN MIDDLEMARCH MY DEAR SIRSAID THE BANKER. I MEAN IN KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL NOT IN SOCIAL STATUSFOR OUR MEDICAL MEN ARE MOST OF THEM CONNECTED WITH RESPECTABLETOWNSPEOPLE HERE. MY OWN IMPERFECT HEALTH HAS INDUCED ME TO GIVE SOMEATTENTION TO THOSE PALLIATIVE RESOURCES WHICH THE DIVINE MERCY HASPLACED WITHIN OUR REACH. I HAVE CONSULTED EMINENT MEN IN THEMETROPOLIS AND I AM PAINFULLY AWARE OF THE BACKWARDNESS UNDER WHICHMEDICAL TREATMENT LABORS IN OUR PROVINCIAL DISTRICTS.YESWITH OUR PRESENT MEDICAL RULES AND EDUCATION ONE MUST BESATISFIED NOW AND THEN TO MEET WITH A FAIR PRACTITIONER. AS TO ALL THEHIGHER QUESTIONS WHICH DETERMINE THE STARTINGPOINT OF A DIAGNOSISASTO THE PHILOSOPHY OF MEDICAL EVIDENCEANY GLIMMERING OF THESE CAN ONLYCOME FROM A SCIENTIFIC CULTURE OF WHICH COUNTRY PRACTITIONERS HAVEUSUALLY NO MORE NOTION THAN THE MAN IN THE MOON.MR. BULSTRODE BENDING AND LOOKING INTENTLY FOUND THE FORM WHICHLYDGATE HAD GIVEN TO HIS AGREEMENT NOT QUITE SUITED TO HISCOMPREHENSION. UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES A JUDICIOUS MAN CHANGES THETOPIC AND ENTERS ON GROUND WHERE HIS OWN GIFTS MAY BE MORE USEFUL.I AM AWARE HE SAID THAT THE PECULIAR BIAS OF MEDICAL ABILITY ISTOWARDS MATERIAL MEANS. NEVERTHELESS MR. LYDGATE I HOPE WE SHALL NOTVARY IN SENTIMENT AS TO A MEASURE IN WHICH YOU ARE NOT LIKELY TO BEACTIVELY CONCERNED BUT IN WHICH YOUR SYMPATHETIC CONCURRENCE MAY BE ANAID TO ME. YOU RECOGNIZE I HOPE THE EXISTENCE OF SPIRITUAL INTERESTSIN YOUR PATIENTSCERTAINLY I DO. BUT THOSE WORDS ARE APT TO COVER DIFFERENT MEANINGS TODIFFERENT MINDS.PRECISELY. AND ON SUCH SUBJECTS WRONG TEACHING IS AS FATAL AS NOTEACHING. NOW A POINT WHICH I HAVE MUCH AT HEART TO SECURE IS A NEWREGULATION AS TO CLERICAL ATTENDANCE AT THE OLD INFIRMARY. THE BUILDINGSTANDS IN MR. FAREBROTHERS PARISH. YOU KNOW MR. FAREBROTHERI HAVE SEEN HIM. HE GAVE ME HIS VOTE. I MUST CALL TO THANK HIM. HESEEMS A VERY BRIGHT PLEASANT LITTLE FELLOW. AND I UNDERSTAND HE IS ANATURALIST.MR. FAREBROTHER MY DEAR SIR IS A MAN DEEPLY PAINFUL TO CONTEMPLATE.I SUPPOSE THERE IS NOT A CLERGYMAN IN THIS COUNTRY WHO HAS GREATERTALENTS. MR. BULSTRODE PAUSED AND LOOKED MEDITATIVE.I HAVE NOT YET BEEN PAINED BY FINDING ANY EXCESSIVE TALENT INMIDDLEMARCH SAID LYDGATE BLUNTLY.WHAT I DESIRE MR. BULSTRODE CONTINUED LOOKING STILL MORE SERIOUSIS THAT MR. FAREBROTHERS ATTENDANCE AT THE HOSPITAL SHOULD BESUPERSEDED BY THE APPOINTMENT OF A CHAPLAINOF MR. TYKE IN FACTANDTHAT NO OTHER SPIRITUAL AID SHOULD BE CALLED IN.AS A MEDICAL MAN I COULD HAVE NO OPINION ON SUCH A POINT UNLESS I KNEWMR. TYKE AND EVEN THEN I SHOULD REQUIRE TO KNOW THE CASES IN WHICH HEWAS APPLIED. LYDGATE SMILED BUT HE WAS BENT ON BEING CIRCUMSPECT.OF COURSE YOU CANNOT ENTER FULLY INTO THE MERITS OF THIS MEASURE ATPRESENT. BUTHERE MR. BULSTRODE BEGAN TO SPEAK WITH A MORE CHISELLEDEMPHASISTHE SUBJECT IS LIKELY TO BE REFERRED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD OFTHE INFIRMARY AND WHAT I TRUST I MAY ASK OF YOU IS THAT IN VIRTUE OFTHE COOPERATION BETWEEN US WHICH I NOW LOOK FORWARD TO YOU WILL NOTSO FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED BE INFLUENCED BY MY OPPONENTS IN THISMATTER.I HOPE I SHALL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH CLERICAL DISPUTES SAIDLYDGATE. THE PATH I HAVE CHOSEN IS TO WORK WELL IN MY OWN PROFESSION.MY RESPONSIBILITY MR. LYDGATE IS OF A BROADER KIND. WITH ME INDEEDTHIS QUESTION IS ONE OF SACRED ACCOUNTABLENESS WHEREAS WITH MYOPPONENTS I HAVE GOOD REASON TO SAY THAT IT IS AN OCCASION FORGRATIFYING A SPIRIT OF WORLDLY OPPOSITION. BUT I SHALL NOT THEREFOREDROP ONE IOTA OF MY CONVICTIONS OR CEASE TO IDENTIFY MYSELF WITH THATTRUTH WHICH AN EVIL GENERATION HATES. I HAVE DEVOTED MYSELF TO THISOBJECT OF HOSPITALIMPROVEMENT BUT I WILL BOLDLY CONFESS TO YOU MR.LYDGATE THAT I SHOULD HAVE NO INTEREST IN HOSPITALS IF I BELIEVED THATNOTHING MORE WAS CONCERNED THEREIN THAN THE CURE OF MORTAL DISEASES. IHAVE ANOTHER GROUND OF ACTION AND IN THE FACE OF PERSECUTION I WILLNOT CONCEAL IT.MR. BULSTRODES VOICE HAD BECOME A LOUD AND AGITATED WHISPER AS HE SAIDTHE LAST WORDS.THERE WE CERTAINLY DIFFER SAID LYDGATE. BUT HE WAS NOT SORRY THATTHE DOOR WAS NOW OPENED AND MR. VINCY WAS ANNOUNCED. THAT FLORIDSOCIABLE PERSONAGE WAS BECOME MORE INTERESTING TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEENROSAMOND. NOT THAT LIKE HER HE HAD BEEN WEAVING ANY FUTURE IN WHICHTHEIR LOTS WERE UNITED BUT A MAN NATURALLY REMEMBERS A CHARMING GIRLWITH PLEASURE AND IS WILLING TO DINE WHERE HE MAY SEE HER AGAIN.BEFORE HE TOOK LEAVE MR. VINCY HAD GIVEN THAT INVITATION WHICH HE HADBEEN IN NO HURRY ABOUT FOR ROSAMOND AT BREAKFAST HAD MENTIONED THATSHE THOUGHT HER UNCLE FEATHERSTONE HAD TAKEN THE NEW DOCTOR INTO GREATFAVOR.MR. BULSTRODE ALONE WITH HIS BROTHERINLAW POURED HIMSELF OUT AGLASS OF WATER AND OPENED A SANDWICHBOX.I CANNOT PERSUADE YOU TO ADOPT MY REGIMEN VINCYNO NO IVE NO OPINION OF THAT SYSTEM. LIFE WANTS PADDING SAID MR.VINCY UNABLE TO OMIT HIS PORTABLE THEORY. HOWEVER HE WENT ONACCENTING THE WORD AS IF TO DISMISS ALL IRRELEVANCE WHAT I CAME HERETO TALK ABOUT WAS A LITTLE AFFAIR OF MY YOUNG SCAPEGRACE FREDS.THAT IS A SUBJECT ON WHICH YOU AND I ARE LIKELY TO TAKE QUITE ASDIFFERENT VIEWS AS ON DIET VINCY.I HOPE NOT THIS TIME. MR. VINCY WAS RESOLVED TO BE GOODHUMORED.THE FACT IS ITS ABOUT A WHIM OF OLD FEATHERSTONES. SOMEBODY HASBEEN COOKING UP A STORY OUT OF SPITE AND TELLING IT TO THE OLD MAN TOTRY TO SET HIM AGAINST FRED. HES VERY FOND OF FRED AND IS LIKELY TODO SOMETHING HANDSOME FOR HIM INDEED HE HAS AS GOOD AS TOLD FRED THATHE MEANS TO LEAVE HIM HIS LAND AND THAT MAKES OTHER PEOPLE JEALOUS.VINCY I MUST REPEAT THAT YOU WILL NOT GET ANY CONCURRENCE FROM ME ASTO THE COURSE YOU HAVE PURSUED WITH YOUR ELDEST SON. IT WAS ENTIRELYFROM WORLDLY VANITY THAT YOU DESTINED HIM FOR THE CHURCH WITH A FAMILYOF THREE SONS AND FOUR DAUGHTERS YOU WERE NOT WARRANTED IN DEVOTINGMONEY TO AN EXPENSIVE EDUCATION WHICH HAS SUCCEEDED IN NOTHING BUT INGIVING HIM EXTRAVAGANT IDLE HABITS. YOU ARE NOW REAPING THECONSEQUENCES.TO POINT OUT OTHER PEOPLES ERRORS WAS A DUTY THAT MR. BULSTRODE RARELYSHRANK FROM BUT MR. VINCY WAS NOT EQUALLY PREPARED TO BE PATIENT. WHENA MAN HAS THE IMMEDIATE PROSPECT OF BEING MAYOR AND IS READY IN THEINTERESTS OF COMMERCE TO TAKE UP A FIRM ATTITUDE ON POLITICSGENERALLY HE HAS NATURALLY A SENSE OF HIS IMPORTANCE TO THE FRAMEWORKOF THINGS WHICH SEEMS TO THROW QUESTIONS OF PRIVATE CONDUCT INTO THEBACKGROUND. AND THIS PARTICULAR REPROOF IRRITATED HIM MORE THAN ANYOTHER. IT WAS EMINENTLY SUPERFLUOUS TO HIM TO BE TOLD THAT HE WASREAPING THE CONSEQUENCES. BUT HE FELT HIS NECK UNDER BULSTRODES YOKEAND THOUGH HE USUALLY ENJOYED KICKING HE WAS ANXIOUS TO REFRAIN FROMTHAT RELIEF.AS TO THAT BULSTRODE ITS NO USE GOING BACK. IM NOT ONE OF YOURPATTERN MEN AND I DONT PRETEND TO BE. I COULDNT FORESEE EVERYTHINGIN THE TRADE THERE WASNT A FINER BUSINESS IN MIDDLEMARCH THAN OURSAND THE LAD WAS CLEVER. MY POOR BROTHER WAS IN THE CHURCH AND WOULDHAVE DONE WELLHAD GOT PREFERMENT ALREADY BUT THAT STOMACH FEVER TOOKHIM OFF ELSE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A DEAN BY THIS TIME. I THINK I WASJUSTIFIED IN WHAT I TRIED TO DO FOR FRED. IF YOU COME TO RELIGION ITSEEMS TO ME A MAN SHOULDNT WANT TO CARVE OUT HIS MEAT TO AN OUNCEBEFOREHANDONE MUST TRUST A LITTLE TO PROVIDENCE AND BE GENEROUS. ITSA GOOD BRITISH FEELING TO TRY AND RAISE YOUR FAMILY A LITTLE IN MYOPINION ITS A FATHERS DUTY TO GIVE HIS SONS A FINE CHANCE.I DONT WISH TO ACT OTHERWISE THAN AS YOUR BEST FRIEND VINCY WHEN ISAY THAT WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN UTTERING JUST NOW IS ONE MASS OFWORLDLINESS AND INCONSISTENT FOLLY.VERY WELL SAID MR. VINCY KICKING IN SPITE OF RESOLUTIONS I NEVERPROFESSED TO BE ANYTHING BUT WORLDLY AND WHATS MORE I DONT SEEANYBODY ELSE WHO IS NOT WORLDLY. I SUPPOSE YOU DONT CONDUCT BUSINESSON WHAT YOU CALL UNWORLDLY PRINCIPLES. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE I SEE ISTHAT ONE WORLDLINESS IS A LITTLE BIT HONESTER THAN ANOTHER.THIS KIND OF DISCUSSION IS UNFRUITFUL VINCY SAID MR. BULSTRODEWHO FINISHING HIS SANDWICH HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK IN HIS CHAIR ANDSHADED HIS EYES AS IF WEARY. YOU HAD SOME MORE PARTICULAR BUSINESS.YES YES. THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT IS SOMEBODY HAS TOLD OLDFEATHERSTONE GIVING YOU AS THE AUTHORITY THAT FRED HAS BEEN BORROWINGOR TRYING TO BORROW MONEY ON THE PROSPECT OF HIS LAND. OF COURSE YOUNEVER SAID ANY SUCH NONSENSE. BUT THE OLD FELLOW WILL INSIST ON IT THATFRED SHOULD BRING HIM A DENIAL IN YOUR HANDWRITING THAT IS JUST A BITOF A NOTE SAYING YOU DONT BELIEVE A WORD OF SUCH STUFF EITHER OF HISHAVING BORROWED OR TRIED TO BORROW IN SUCH A FOOLS WAY. I SUPPOSE YOUCAN HAVE NO OBJECTION TO DO THAT.PARDON ME. I HAVE AN OBJECTION. I AM BY NO MEANS SURE THAT YOUR SONIN HIS RECKLESSNESS AND IGNORANCEI WILL USE NO SEVERER WORDHAS NOTTRIED TO RAISE MONEY BY HOLDING OUT HIS FUTURE PROSPECTS OR EVEN THATSOME ONE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO SUPPLY HIM ON SO VAGUE APRESUMPTION THERE IS PLENTY OF SUCH LAX MONEYLENDING AS OF OTHERFOLLY IN THE WORLD.BUT FRED GIVES ME HIS HONOR THAT HE HAS NEVER BORROWED MONEY ON THEPRETENCE OF ANY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HIS UNCLES LAND. HE IS NOT A LIAR.I DONT WANT TO MAKE HIM BETTER THAN HE IS. I HAVE BLOWN HIM UPWELLNOBODY CAN SAY I WINK AT WHAT HE DOES. BUT HE IS NOT A LIAR. AND ISHOULD HAVE THOUGHTBUT I MAY BE WRONGTHAT THERE WAS NO RELIGION TOHINDER A MAN FROM BELIEVING THE BEST OF A YOUNG FELLOW WHEN YOU DONTKNOW WORSE. IT SEEMS TO ME IT WOULD BE A POOR SORT OF RELIGION TO PUT ASPOKE IN HIS WHEEL BY REFUSING TO SAY YOU DONT BELIEVE SUCH HARM OFHIM AS YOUVE GOT NO GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE.I AM NOT AT ALL SURE THAT I SHOULD BE BEFRIENDING YOUR SON BYSMOOTHING HIS WAY TO THE FUTURE POSSESSION OF FEATHERSTONES PROPERTY.I CANNOT REGARD WEALTH AS A BLESSING TO THOSE WHO USE IT SIMPLY AS AHARVEST FOR THIS WORLD. YOU DO NOT LIKE TO HEAR THESE THINGS VINCYBUT ON THIS OCCASION I FEEL CALLED UPON TO TELL YOU THAT I HAVE NOMOTIVE FOR FURTHERING SUCH A DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY AS THAT WHICH YOUREFER TO. I DO NOT SHRINK FROM SAYING THAT IT WILL NOT TEND TO YOURSONS ETERNAL WELFARE OR TO THE GLORY OF GOD. WHY THEN SHOULD YOUEXPECT ME TO PEN THIS KIND OF AFFIDAVIT WHICH HAS NO OBJECT BUT TOKEEP UP A FOOLISH PARTIALITY AND SECURE A FOOLISH BEQUESTIF YOU MEAN TO HINDER EVERYBODY FROM HAVING MONEY BUT SAINTS ANDEVANGELISTS YOU MUST GIVE UP SOME PROFITABLE PARTNERSHIPS THATS ALLI CAN SAY MR. VINCY BURST OUT VERY BLUNTLY. IT MAY BE FOR THE GLORYOF GOD BUT IT IS NOT FOR THE GLORY OF THE MIDDLEMARCH TRADE THATPLYMDALES HOUSE USES THOSE BLUE AND GREEN DYES IT GETS FROM THEBRASSING MANUFACTORY THEY ROT THE SILK THATS ALL I KNOW ABOUT IT.PERHAPS IF OTHER PEOPLE KNEW SO MUCH OF THE PROFIT WENT TO THE GLORY OFGOD THEY MIGHT LIKE IT BETTER. BUT I DONT MIND SO MUCH ABOUT THATICOULD GET UP A PRETTY ROW IF I CHOSE.MR. BULSTRODE PAUSED A LITTLE BEFORE HE ANSWERED. YOU PAIN ME VERYMUCH BY SPEAKING IN THIS WAY VINCY. I DO NOT EXPECT YOU TO UNDERSTANDMY GROUNDS OF ACTIONIT IS NOT AN EASY THING EVEN TO THREAD A PATH FORPRINCIPLES IN THE INTRICACIES OF THE WORLDSTILL LESS TO MAKE THETHREAD CLEAR FOR THE CARELESS AND THE SCOFFING. YOU MUST REMEMBER IFYOU PLEASE THAT I STRETCH MY TOLERANCE TOWARDS YOU AS MY WIFESBROTHER AND THAT IT LITTLE BECOMES YOU TO COMPLAIN OF ME ASWITHHOLDING MATERIAL HELP TOWARDS THE WORLDLY POSITION OF YOUR FAMILY.I MUST REMIND YOU THAT IT IS NOT YOUR OWN PRUDENCE OR JUDGMENT THAT HASENABLED YOU TO KEEP YOUR PLACE IN THE TRADE.VERY LIKELY NOT BUT YOU HAVE BEEN NO LOSER BY MY TRADE YET SAID MR.VINCY THOROUGHLY NETTLED A RESULT WHICH WAS SELDOM MUCH RETARDED BYPREVIOUS RESOLUTIONS. AND WHEN YOU MARRIED HARRIET I DONT SEE HOWYOU COULD EXPECT THAT OUR FAMILIES SHOULD NOT HANG BY THE SAME NAIL. IFYOUVE CHANGED YOUR MIND AND WANT MY FAMILY TO COME DOWN IN THE WORLDYOUD BETTER SAY SO. IVE NEVER CHANGED IM A PLAIN CHURCHMAN NOWJUST AS I USED TO BE BEFORE DOCTRINES CAME UP. I TAKE THE WORLD AS IFIND IT IN TRADE AND EVERYTHING ELSE. IM CONTENTED TO BE NO WORSETHAN MY NEIGHBORS. BUT IF YOU WANT US TO COME DOWN IN THE WORLD SAYSO. I SHALL KNOW BETTER WHAT TO DO THEN.YOU TALK UNREASONABLY. SHALL YOU COME DOWN IN THE WORLD FOR WANT OFTHIS LETTER ABOUT YOUR SONWELL WHETHER OR NOT I CONSIDER IT VERY UNHANDSOME OF YOU TO REFUSEIT. SUCH DOINGS MAY BE LINED WITH RELIGION BUT OUTSIDE THEY HAVE ANASTY DOGINTHEMANGER LOOK. YOU MIGHT AS WELL SLANDER FRED IT COMESPRETTY NEAR TO IT WHEN YOU REFUSE TO SAY YOU DIDNT SET A SLANDERGOING. ITS THIS SORT OF THINGTHIS TYRANNICAL SPIRIT WANTING TO PLAYBISHOP AND BANKER EVERYWHEREITS THIS SORT OF THING MAKES A MANS NAMESTINK.VINCY IF YOU INSIST ON QUARRELLING WITH ME IT WILL BE EXCEEDINGLYPAINFUL TO HARRIET AS WELL AS MYSELF SAID MR. BULSTRODE WITH ATRIFLE MORE EAGERNESS AND PALENESS THAN USUAL.I DONT WANT TO QUARREL. ITS FOR MY INTERESTAND PERHAPS FOR YOURSTOOTHAT WE SHOULD BE FRIENDS. I BEAR YOU NO GRUDGE I THINK NO WORSEOF YOU THAN I DO OF OTHER PEOPLE. A MAN WHO HALF STARVES HIMSELF ANDGOES THE LENGTH IN FAMILY PRAYERS AND SO ON THAT YOU DO BELIEVES INHIS RELIGION WHATEVER IT MAY BE YOU COULD TURN OVER YOUR CAPITAL JUSTAS FAST WITH CURSING AND SWEARINGPLENTY OF FELLOWS DO. YOU LIKE TO BEMASTER THERES NO DENYING THAT YOU MUST BE FIRST CHOP IN HEAVEN ELSEYOU WONT LIKE IT MUCH. BUT YOURE MY SISTERS HUSBAND AND WE OUGHT TOSTICK TOGETHER AND IF I KNOW HARRIET SHELL CONSIDER IT YOUR FAULT IFWE QUARREL BECAUSE YOU STRAIN AT A GNAT IN THIS WAY AND REFUSE TO DOFRED A GOOD TURN. AND I DONT MEAN TO SAY I SHALL BEAR IT WELL. ICONSIDER IT UNHANDSOME.MR. VINCY ROSE BEGAN TO BUTTON HIS GREATCOAT AND LOOKED STEADILY ATHIS BROTHERINLAW MEANING TO IMPLY A DEMAND FOR A DECISIVE ANSWER.THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT MR. BULSTRODE HAD BEGUN BY ADMONISHINGMR. VINCY AND HAD ENDED BY SEEING A VERY UNSATISFACTORY REFLECTION OFHIMSELF IN THE COARSE UNFLATTERING MIRROR WHICH THAT MANUFACTURERSMIND PRESENTED TO THE SUBTLER LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OF HIS FELLOWMEN ANDPERHAPS HIS EXPERIENCE OUGHT TO HAVE WARNED HIM HOW THE SCENE WOULDEND. BUT A FULLFED FOUNTAIN WILL BE GENEROUS WITH ITS WATERS EVEN INTHE RAIN WHEN THEY ARE WORSE THAN USELESS AND A FINE FOUNT OFADMONITION IS APT TO BE EQUALLY IRREPRESSIBLE.IT WAS NOT IN MR. BULSTRODES NATURE TO COMPLY DIRECTLY IN CONSEQUENCEOF UNCOMFORTABLE SUGGESTIONS. BEFORE CHANGING HIS COURSE HE ALWAYSNEEDED TO SHAPE HIS MOTIVES AND BRING THEM INTO ACCORDANCE WITH HISHABITUAL STANDARD. HE SAID AT LASTI WILL REFLECT A LITTLE VINCY. I WILL MENTION THE SUBJECT TO HARRIET.I SHALL PROBABLY SEND YOU A LETTER.VERY WELL. AS SOON AS YOU CAN PLEASE. I HOPE IT WILL ALL BE SETTLEDBEFORE I SEE YOU TOMORROW.CHAPTER XIV.FOLLOWS HERE THE STRICT RECEIPTFOR THAT SAUCE TO DAINTY MEATNAMED IDLENESS WHICH MANY EATBY PREFERENCE AND CALL IT SWEETFIRST WATCH FOR MORSELS LIKE A HOUNDMIX WELL WITH BUFFETS STIR THEM ROUNDWITH GOOD THICK OIL OF FLATTERIES AND FROTH WITH MEAN SELFLAUDINGLIES.SERVE WARM THE VESSELS YOU MUST CHOOSETO KEEP IT IN ARE DEAD MENS SHOES.MR. BULSTRODES CONSULTATION OF HARRIET SEEMED TO HAVE HAD THE EFFECTDESIRED BY MR. VINCY FOR EARLY THE NEXT MORNING A LETTER CAME WHICHFRED COULD CARRY TO MR. FEATHERSTONE AS THE REQUIRED TESTIMONY.THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS STAYING IN BED ON ACCOUNT OF THE COLD WEATHERAND AS MARY GARTH WAS NOT TO BE SEEN IN THE SITTINGROOM FRED WENTUPSTAIRS IMMEDIATELY AND PRESENTED THE LETTER TO HIS UNCLE WHOPROPPED UP COMFORTABLY ON A BEDREST WAS NOT LESS ABLE THAN USUAL TOENJOY HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF WISDOM IN DISTRUSTING AND FRUSTRATINGMANKIND. HE PUT ON HIS SPECTACLES TO READ THE LETTER PURSING UP HISLIPS AND DRAWING DOWN THEIR CORNERS.UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I WILL NOT DECLINE TO STATE MYCONVICTIONTCHAH WHAT FINE WORDS THE FELLOW PUTS HES AS FINE AS ANAUCTIONEERTHAT YOUR SON FREDERIC HAS NOT OBTAINED ANY ADVANCE OFMONEY ON BEQUESTS PROMISED BY MR. FEATHERSTONEPROMISED WHO SAID IHAD EVER PROMISED I PROMISE NOTHINGI SHALL MAKE CODICILS AS LONG AS ILIKEAND THAT CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF SUCH A PROCEEDING IT ISUNREASONABLE TO PRESUME THAT A YOUNG MAN OF SENSE AND CHARACTER WOULDATTEMPT ITAH BUT THE GENTLEMAN DOESNT SAY YOU ARE A YOUNG MAN OFSENSE AND CHARACTER MARK YOU THAT SIRAS TO MY OWN CONCERN WITH ANYREPORT OF SUCH A NATURE I DISTINCTLY AFFIRM THAT I NEVER MADE ANYSTATEMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT YOUR SON HAD BORROWED MONEY ON ANYPROPERTY THAT MIGHT ACCRUE TO HIM ON MR. FEATHERSTONES DEMISEBLESSMY HEART PROPERTYACCRUEDEMISE LAWYER STANDISH IS NOTHING TO HIM.HE COULDNT SPEAK FINER IF HE WANTED TO BORROW. WELL MR. FEATHERSTONEHERE LOOKED OVER HIS SPECTACLES AT FRED WHILE HE HANDED BACK THELETTER TO HIM WITH A CONTEMPTUOUS GESTURE YOU DONT SUPPOSE I BELIEVEA THING BECAUSE BULSTRODE WRITES IT OUT FINE EHFRED COLORED. YOU WISHED TO HAVE THE LETTER SIR. I SHOULD THINK ITVERY LIKELY THAT MR. BULSTRODES DENIAL IS AS GOOD AS THE AUTHORITYWHICH TOLD YOU WHAT HE DENIES.EVERY BIT. I NEVER SAID I BELIEVED EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER. AND NOWWHAT D YOU EXPECT SAID MR. FEATHERSTONE CURTLY KEEPING ON HISSPECTACLES BUT WITHDRAWING HIS HANDS UNDER HIS WRAPS.I EXPECT NOTHING SIR. FRED WITH DIFFICULTY RESTRAINED HIMSELF FROMVENTING HIS IRRITATION. I CAME TO BRING YOU THE LETTER. IF YOU LIKE IWILL BID YOU GOOD MORNING.NOT YET NOT YET. RING THE BELL I WANT MISSY TO COME.IT WAS A SERVANT WHO CAME IN ANSWER TO THE BELL.TELL MISSY TO COME SAID MR. FEATHERSTONE IMPATIENTLY. WHATBUSINESS HAD SHE TO GO AWAY HE SPOKE IN THE SAME TONE WHEN MARY CAME.WHY COULDNT YOU SIT STILL HERE TILL I TOLD YOU TO GO I WANT MYWAISTCOAT NOW. I TOLD YOU ALWAYS TO PUT IT ON THE BED.MARYS EYES LOOKED RATHER RED AS IF SHE HAD BEEN CRYING. IT WAS CLEARTHAT MR. FEATHERSTONE WAS IN ONE OF HIS MOST SNAPPISH HUMORS THISMORNING AND THOUGH FRED HAD NOW THE PROSPECT OF RECEIVING THEMUCHNEEDED PRESENT OF MONEY HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED BEING FREE TOTURN ROUND ON THE OLD TYRANT AND TELL HIM THAT MARY GARTH WAS TOO GOODTO BE AT HIS BECK. THOUGH FRED HAD RISEN AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM SHEHAD BARELY NOTICED HIM AND LOOKED AS IF HER NERVES WERE QUIVERING WITHTHE EXPECTATION THAT SOMETHING WOULD BE THROWN AT HER. BUT SHE NEVERHAD ANYTHING WORSE THAN WORDS TO DREAD. WHEN SHE WENT TO REACH THEWAISTCOAT FROM A PEG FRED WENT UP TO HER AND SAID ALLOW ME.LET IT ALONE YOU BRING IT MISSY AND LAY IT DOWN HERE SAID MR.FEATHERSTONE. NOW YOU GO AWAY AGAIN TILL I CALL YOU HE ADDED WHENTHE WAISTCOAT WAS LAID DOWN BY HIM. IT WAS USUAL WITH HIM TO SEASON HISPLEASURE IN SHOWING FAVOR TO ONE PERSON BY BEING ESPECIALLYDISAGREEABLE TO ANOTHER AND MARY WAS ALWAYS AT HAND TO FURNISH THECONDIMENT. WHEN HIS OWN RELATIVES CAME SHE WAS TREATED BETTER. SLOWLYHE TOOK OUT A BUNCH OF KEYS FROM THE WAISTCOAT POCKET AND SLOWLY HEDREW FORTH A TIN BOX WHICH WAS UNDER THE BEDCLOTHES.YOU EXPECT I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE FORTUNE EH HE SAIDLOOKING ABOVE HIS SPECTACLES AND PAUSING IN THE ACT OF OPENING THE LID.NOT AT ALL SIR. YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO SPEAK OF MAKING ME A PRESENTTHE OTHER DAY ELSE OF COURSE I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF THEMATTER. BUT FRED WAS OF A HOPEFUL DISPOSITION AND A VISION HADPRESENTED ITSELF OF A SUM JUST LARGE ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIM FROM ACERTAIN ANXIETY. WHEN FRED GOT INTO DEBT IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO HIMHIGHLY PROBABLE THAT SOMETHING OR OTHERHE DID NOT NECESSARILY CONCEIVEWHATWOULD COME TO PASS ENABLING HIM TO PAY IN DUE TIME. AND NOW THATTHE PROVIDENTIAL OCCURRENCE WAS APPARENTLY CLOSE AT HAND IT WOULD HAVEBEEN SHEER ABSURDITY TO THINK THAT THE SUPPLY WOULD BE SHORT OF THENEED AS ABSURD AS A FAITH THAT BELIEVED IN HALF A MIRACLE FOR WANT OFSTRENGTH TO BELIEVE IN A WHOLE ONE.THE DEEPVEINED HANDS FINGERED MANY BANKNOTES ONE AFTER THE OTHERLAYING THEM DOWN FLAT AGAIN WHILE FRED LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIRSCORNING TO LOOK EAGER. HE HELD HIMSELF TO BE A GENTLEMAN AT HEART ANDDID NOT LIKE COURTING AN OLD FELLOW FOR HIS MONEY. AT LAST MR.FEATHERSTONE EYED HIM AGAIN OVER HIS SPECTACLES AND PRESENTED HIM WITHA LITTLE SHEAF OF NOTES FRED COULD SEE DISTINCTLY THAT THERE WERE BUTFIVE AS THE LESS SIGNIFICANT EDGES GAPED TOWARDS HIM. BUT THEN EACHMIGHT MEAN FIFTY POUNDS. HE TOOK THEM SAYINGI AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU SIR AND WAS GOING TO ROLL THEM UPWITHOUT SEEMING TO THINK OF THEIR VALUE. BUT THIS DID NOT SUIT MR.FEATHERSTONE WHO WAS EYING HIM INTENTLY.COME DONT YOU THINK IT WORTH YOUR WHILE TO COUNT EM YOU TAKE MONEYLIKE A LORD I SUPPOSE YOU LOSE IT LIKE ONE.I THOUGHT I WAS NOT TO LOOK A GIFTHORSE IN THE MOUTH SIR. BUT ISHALL BE VERY HAPPY TO COUNT THEM.FRED WAS NOT SO HAPPY HOWEVER AFTER HE HAD COUNTED THEM. FOR THEYACTUALLY PRESENTED THE ABSURDITY OF BEING LESS THAN HIS HOPEFULNESS HADDECIDED THAT THEY MUST BE. WHAT CAN THE FITNESS OF THINGS MEAN IF NOTTHEIR FITNESS TO A MANS EXPECTATIONS FAILING THIS ABSURDITY ANDATHEISM GAPE BEHIND HIM. THE COLLAPSE FOR FRED WAS SEVERE WHEN HE FOUNDTHAT HE HELD NO MORE THAN FIVE TWENTIES AND HIS SHARE IN THE HIGHEREDUCATION OF THIS COUNTRY DID NOT SEEM TO HELP HIM. NEVERTHELESS HESAID WITH RAPID CHANGES IN HIS FAIR COMPLEXIONIT IS VERY HANDSOME OF YOU SIR.I SHOULD THINK IT IS SAID MR. FEATHERSTONE LOCKING HIS BOX ANDREPLACING IT THEN TAKING OFF HIS SPECTACLES DELIBERATELY AND ATLENGTH AS IF HIS INWARD MEDITATION HAD MORE DEEPLY CONVINCED HIMREPEATING I SHOULD THINK IT HANDSOME.I ASSURE YOU SIR I AM VERY GRATEFUL SAID FRED WHO HAD HAD TIME TORECOVER HIS CHEERFUL AIR.SO YOU OUGHT TO BE. YOU WANT TO CUT A FIGURE IN THE WORLD AND IRECKON PETER FEATHERSTONE IS THE ONLY ONE YOUVE GOT TO TRUST TO. HERETHE OLD MANS EYES GLEAMED WITH A CURIOUSLY MINGLED SATISFACTION IN THECONSCIOUSNESS THAT THIS SMART YOUNG FELLOW RELIED UPON HIM AND THATTHE SMART YOUNG FELLOW WAS RATHER A FOOL FOR DOING SO.YES INDEED I WAS NOT BORN TO VERY SPLENDID CHANCES. FEW MEN HAVEBEEN MORE CRAMPED THAN I HAVE BEEN SAID FRED WITH SOME SENSE OFSURPRISE AT HIS OWN VIRTUE CONSIDERING HOW HARDLY HE WAS DEALT WITH.IT REALLY SEEMS A LITTLE TOO BAD TO HAVE TO RIDE A BROKENWINDEDHUNTER AND SEE MEN WHO ARE NOT HALF SUCH GOOD JUDGES AS YOURSELFABLE TO THROW AWAY ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY ON BUYING BAD BARGAINS.WELL YOU CAN BUY YOURSELF A FINE HUNTER NOW. EIGHTY POUND IS ENOUGHFOR THAT I RECKONAND YOULL HAVE TWENTY POUND OVER TO GET YOURSELFOUT OF ANY LITTLE SCRAPE SAID MR. FEATHERSTONE CHUCKLING SLIGHTLY.YOU ARE VERY GOOD SIR SAID FRED WITH A FINE SENSE OF CONTRASTBETWEEN THE WORDS AND HIS FEELING.AY RATHER A BETTER UNCLE THAN YOUR FINE UNCLE BULSTRODE. YOU WONTGET MUCH OUT OF HIS SPEKILATIONS I THINK. HES GOT A PRETTY STRONGSTRING ROUND YOUR FATHERS LEG BY WHAT I HEAR EHMY FATHER NEVER TELLS ME ANYTHING ABOUT HIS AFFAIRS SIR.WELL HE SHOWS SOME SENSE THERE. BUT OTHER PEOPLE FIND EM OUT WITHOUTHIS TELLING. HELL NEVER HAVE MUCH TO LEAVE YOU HELL MOSTLIKE DIEWITHOUT A WILLHES THE SORT OF MAN TO DO ITLET EM MAKE HIM MAYOR OFMIDDLEMARCH AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE. BUT YOU WONT GET MUCH BY HIS DYINGWITHOUT A WILL THOUGH YOU ARE THE ELDEST SON.FRED THOUGHT THAT MR. FEATHERSTONE HAD NEVER BEEN SO DISAGREEABLEBEFORE. TRUE HE HAD NEVER BEFORE GIVEN HIM QUITE SO MUCH MONEY ATONCE.SHALL I DESTROY THIS LETTER OF MR. BULSTRODES SIR SAID FREDRISING WITH THE LETTER AS IF HE WOULD PUT IT IN THE FIRE.AY AY I DONT WANT IT. ITS WORTH NO MONEY TO ME.FRED CARRIED THE LETTER TO THE FIRE AND THRUST THE POKER THROUGH ITWITH MUCH ZEST. HE LONGED TO GET OUT OF THE ROOM BUT HE WAS A LITTLEASHAMED BEFORE HIS INNER SELF AS WELL AS BEFORE HIS UNCLE TO RUN AWAYIMMEDIATELY AFTER POCKETING THE MONEY. PRESENTLY THE FARMBAILIFF CAMEUP TO GIVE HIS MASTER A REPORT AND FRED TO HIS UNSPEAKABLE RELIEFWAS DISMISSED WITH THE INJUNCTION TO COME AGAIN SOON.HE HAD LONGED NOT ONLY TO BE SET FREE FROM HIS UNCLE BUT ALSO TO FINDMARY GARTH. SHE WAS NOW IN HER USUAL PLACE BY THE FIRE WITH SEWING INHER HANDS AND A BOOK OPEN ON THE LITTLE TABLE BY HER SIDE. HER EYELIDSHAD LOST SOME OF THEIR REDNESS NOW AND SHE HAD HER USUAL AIR OFSELFCOMMAND.AM I WANTED UPSTAIRS SHE SAID HALF RISING AS FRED ENTERED.NO I AM ONLY DISMISSED BECAUSE SIMMONS IS GONE UP.MARY SAT DOWN AGAIN AND RESUMED HER WORK. SHE WAS CERTAINLY TREATINGHIM WITH MORE INDIFFERENCE THAN USUAL SHE DID NOT KNOW HOWAFFECTIONATELY INDIGNANT HE HAD FELT ON HER BEHALF UPSTAIRS.MAY I STAY HERE A LITTLE MARY OR SHALL I BORE YOUPRAY SIT DOWN SAID MARY YOU WILL NOT BE SO HEAVY A BORE AS MR.JOHN WAULE WHO WAS HERE YESTERDAY AND HE SAT DOWN WITHOUT ASKING MYLEAVE.POOR FELLOW I THINK HE IS IN LOVE WITH YOU.I AM NOT AWARE OF IT. AND TO ME IT IS ONE OF THE MOST ODIOUS THINGS INA GIRLS LIFE THAT THERE MUST ALWAYS BE SOME SUPPOSITION OF FALLING INLOVE COMING BETWEEN HER AND ANY MAN WHO IS KIND TO HER AND TO WHOM SHEIS GRATEFUL. I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT I AT LEAST MIGHT HAVE BEENSAFE FROM ALL THAT. I HAVE NO GROUND FOR THE NONSENSICAL VANITY OFFANCYING EVERYBODY WHO COMES NEAR ME IS IN LOVE WITH ME.MARY DID NOT MEAN TO BETRAY ANY FEELING BUT IN SPITE OF HERSELF SHEENDED IN A TREMULOUS TONE OF VEXATION.CONFOUND JOHN WAULE I DID NOT MEAN TO MAKE YOU ANGRY. I DIDNT KNOWYOU HAD ANY REASON FOR BEING GRATEFUL TO ME. I FORGOT WHAT A GREATSERVICE YOU THINK IT IF ANY ONE SNUFFS A CANDLE FOR YOU. FRED ALSO HADHIS PRIDE AND WAS NOT GOING TO SHOW THAT HE KNEW WHAT HAD CALLED FORTHTHIS OUTBURST OF MARYS.OH I AM NOT ANGRY EXCEPT WITH THE WAYS OF THE WORLD. I DO LIKE TO BESPOKEN TO AS IF I HAD COMMONSENSE. I REALLY OFTEN FEEL AS IF I COULDUNDERSTAND A LITTLE MORE THAN I EVER HEAR EVEN FROM YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHOHAVE BEEN TO COLLEGE. MARY HAD RECOVERED AND SHE SPOKE WITH ASUPPRESSED RIPPLING UNDERCURRENT OF LAUGHTER PLEASANT TO HEAR.I DONT CARE HOW MERRY YOU ARE AT MY EXPENSE THIS MORNING SAID FREDI THOUGHT YOU LOOKED SO SAD WHEN YOU CAME UPSTAIRS. IT IS A SHAME YOUSHOULD STAY HERE TO BE BULLIED IN THAT WAY.OH I HAVE AN EASY LIFEBY COMPARISON. I HAVE TRIED BEING A TEACHERAND I AM NOT FIT FOR THAT MY MIND IS TOO FOND OF WANDERING ON ITS OWNWAY. I THINK ANY HARDSHIP IS BETTER THAN PRETENDING TO DO WHAT ONE ISPAID FOR AND NEVER REALLY DOING IT. EVERYTHING HERE I CAN DO AS WELLAS ANY ONE ELSE COULD PERHAPS BETTER THAN SOMEROSY FOR EXAMPLE.THOUGH SHE IS JUST THE SORT OF BEAUTIFUL CREATURE THAT IS IMPRISONEDWITH OGRES IN FAIRY TALES.ROSY CRIED FRED IN A TONE OF PROFOUND BROTHERLY SCEPTICISM.COME FRED SAID MARY EMPHATICALLY YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE SOCRITICAL.DO YOU MEAN ANYTHING PARTICULARJUST NOWNO I MEAN SOMETHING GENERALALWAYS.OH THAT I AM IDLE AND EXTRAVAGANT. WELL I AM NOT FIT TO BE A POORMAN. I SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE A BAD FELLOW IF I HAD BEEN RICH.YOU WOULD HAVE DONE YOUR DUTY IN THAT STATE OF LIFE TO WHICH IT HASNOT PLEASED GOD TO CALL YOU SAID MARY LAUGHING.WELL I COULDNT DO MY DUTY AS A CLERGYMAN ANY MORE THAN YOU COULD DOYOURS AS A GOVERNESS. YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A LITTLE FELLOWFEELING THEREMARY.I NEVER SAID YOU OUGHT TO BE A CLERGYMAN. THERE ARE OTHER SORTS OFWORK. IT SEEMS TO ME VERY MISERABLE NOT TO RESOLVE ON SOME COURSE ANDACT ACCORDINGLY.SO I COULD IF FRED BROKE OFF AND STOOD UP LEANING AGAINST THEMANTELPIECE.IF YOU WERE SURE YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE A FORTUNEI DID NOT SAY THAT. YOU WANT TO QUARREL WITH ME. IT IS TOO BAD OF YOUTO BE GUIDED BY WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME.HOW CAN I WANT TO QUARREL WITH YOU I SHOULD BE QUARRELLING WITH ALLMY NEW BOOKS SAID MARY LIFTING THE VOLUME ON THE TABLE. HOWEVERNAUGHTY YOU MAY BE TO OTHER PEOPLE YOU ARE GOOD TO ME.BECAUSE I LIKE YOU BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE. BUT I KNOW YOU DESPISEME.YES I DOA LITTLE SAID MARY NODDING WITH A SMILE.YOU WOULD ADMIRE A STUPENDOUS FELLOW WHO WOULD HAVE WISE OPINIONSABOUT EVERYTHING.YES I SHOULD. MARY WAS SEWING SWIFTLY AND SEEMED PROVOKINGLYMISTRESS OF THE SITUATION. WHEN A CONVERSATION HAS TAKEN A WRONG TURNFOR US WE ONLY GET FARTHER AND FARTHER INTO THE SWAMP OF AWKWARDNESS.THIS WAS WHAT FRED VINCY FELT.I SUPPOSE A WOMAN IS NEVER IN LOVE WITH ANY ONE SHE HAS ALWAYSKNOWNEVER SINCE SHE CAN REMEMBER AS A MAN OFTEN IS. IT IS ALWAYS SOMENEW FELLOW WHO STRIKES A GIRL.LET ME SEE SAID MARY THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH CURLING ARCHLY IMUST GO BACK ON MY EXPERIENCE. THERE IS JULIETSHE SEEMS AN EXAMPLE OFWHAT YOU SAY. BUT THEN OPHELIA HAD PROBABLY KNOWN HAMLET A LONG WHILEAND BRENDA TROILSHE HAD KNOWN MORDAUNT MERTON EVER SINCE THEY WERECHILDREN BUT THEN HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AN ESTIMABLE YOUNG MAN ANDMINNA WAS STILL MORE DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH CLEVELAND WHO WAS A STRANGER.WAVERLEY WAS NEW TO FLORA MACIVOR BUT THEN SHE DID NOT FALL IN LOVEWITH HIM. AND THERE ARE OLIVIA AND SOPHIA PRIMROSE AND CORINNETHEYMAY BE SAID TO HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH NEW MEN. ALTOGETHER MYEXPERIENCE IS RATHER MIXED.MARY LOOKED UP WITH SOME ROGUISHNESS AT FRED AND THAT LOOK OF HERS WASVERY DEAR TO HIM THOUGH THE EYES WERE NOTHING MORE THAN CLEAR WINDOWSWHERE OBSERVATION SAT LAUGHINGLY. HE WAS CERTAINLY AN AFFECTIONATEFELLOW AND AS HE HAD GROWN FROM BOY TO MAN HE HAD GROWN IN LOVE WITHHIS OLD PLAYMATE NOTWITHSTANDING THAT SHARE IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION OFTHE COUNTRY WHICH HAD EXALTED HIS VIEWS OF RANK AND INCOME.WHEN A MAN IS NOT LOVED IT IS NO USE FOR HIM TO SAY THAT HE COULD BEA BETTER FELLOWCOULD DO ANYTHINGI MEAN IF HE WERE SURE OF BEINGLOVED IN RETURN.NOT OF THE LEAST USE IN THE WORLD FOR HIM TO SAY HE COULD BE BETTER.MIGHT COULD WOULDTHEY ARE CONTEMPTIBLE AUXILIARIES.I DONT SEE HOW A MAN IS TO BE GOOD FOR MUCH UNLESS HE HAS SOME ONEWOMAN TO LOVE HIM DEARLY.I THINK THE GOODNESS SHOULD COME BEFORE HE EXPECTS THAT.YOU KNOW BETTER MARY. WOMEN DONT LOVE MEN FOR THEIR GOODNESS.PERHAPS NOT. BUT IF THEY LOVE THEM THEY NEVER THINK THEM BAD.IT IS HARDLY FAIR TO SAY I AM BAD.I SAID NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT YOU.I NEVER SHALL BE GOOD FOR ANYTHING MARY IF YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT YOULOVE MEIF YOU WILL NOT PROMISE TO MARRY MEI MEAN WHEN I AM ABLE TOMARRY.IF I DID LOVE YOU I WOULD NOT MARRY YOU I WOULD CERTAINLY NOTPROMISE EVER TO MARRY YOU.I THINK THAT IS QUITE WICKED MARY. IF YOU LOVE ME YOU OUGHT TOPROMISE TO MARRY ME.ON THE CONTRARY I THINK IT WOULD BE WICKED IN ME TO MARRY YOU EVEN IFI DID LOVE YOU.YOU MEAN JUST AS I AM WITHOUT ANY MEANS OF MAINTAINING A WIFE. OFCOURSE I AM BUT THREEANDTWENTY.IN THAT LAST POINT YOU WILL ALTER. BUT I AM NOT SO SURE OF ANY OTHERALTERATION. MY FATHER SAYS AN IDLE MAN OUGHT NOT TO EXIST MUCH LESSBE MARRIED.THEN I AM TO BLOW MY BRAINS OUTNO ON THE WHOLE I SHOULD THINK YOU WOULD DO BETTER TO PASS YOUREXAMINATION. I HAVE HEARD MR. FAREBROTHER SAY IT IS DISGRACEFULLYEASY.THAT IS ALL VERY FINE. ANYTHING IS EASY TO HIM. NOT THAT CLEVERNESSHAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. I AM TEN TIMES CLEVERER THAN MANY MEN WHOPASS.DEAR ME SAID MARY UNABLE TO REPRESS HER SARCASM THAT ACCOUNTS FORTHE CURATES LIKE MR. CROWSE. DIVIDE YOUR CLEVERNESS BY TEN AND THEQUOTIENTDEAR MEIS ABLE TO TAKE A DEGREE. BUT THAT ONLY SHOWS YOU ARETEN TIMES MORE IDLE THAN THE OTHERS.WELL IF I DID PASS YOU WOULD NOT WANT ME TO GO INTO THE CHURCHTHAT IS NOT THE QUESTIONWHAT I WANT YOU TO DO. YOU HAVE A CONSCIENCEOF YOUR OWN I SUPPOSE. THERE THERE IS MR. LYDGATE. I MUST GO AND TELLMY UNCLE.MARY SAID FRED SEIZING HER HAND AS SHE ROSE IF YOU WILL NOT GIVEME SOME ENCOURAGEMENT I SHALL GET WORSE INSTEAD OF BETTER.I WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANY ENCOURAGEMENT SAID MARY REDDENING. YOURFRIENDS WOULD DISLIKE IT AND SO WOULD MINE. MY FATHER WOULD THINK IT ADISGRACE TO ME IF I ACCEPTED A MAN WHO GOT INTO DEBT AND WOULD NOTWORKFRED WAS STUNG AND RELEASED HER HAND. SHE WALKED TO THE DOOR BUTTHERE SHE TURNED AND SAID FRED YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO GOOD SOGENEROUS TO ME. I AM NOT UNGRATEFUL. BUT NEVER SPEAK TO ME IN THAT WAYAGAIN.VERY WELL SAID FRED SULKILY TAKING UP HIS HAT AND WHIP. HISCOMPLEXION SHOWED PATCHES OF PALE PINK AND DEAD WHITE. LIKE MANY APLUCKED IDLE YOUNG GENTLEMAN HE WAS THOROUGHLY IN LOVE AND WITH APLAIN GIRL WHO HAD NO MONEY BUT HAVING MR. FEATHERSTONES LAND IN THEBACKGROUND AND A PERSUASION THAT LET MARY SAY WHAT SHE WOULD SHEREALLY DID CARE FOR HIM FRED WAS NOT UTTERLY IN DESPAIR.WHEN HE GOT HOME HE GAVE FOUR OF THE TWENTIES TO HIS MOTHER ASKINGHER TO KEEP THEM FOR HIM. I DONT WANT TO SPEND THAT MONEY MOTHER. IWANT IT TO PAY A DEBT WITH. SO KEEP IT SAFE AWAY FROM MY FINGERS.BLESS YOU MY DEAR SAID MRS. VINCY. SHE DOTED ON HER ELDEST SON ANDHER YOUNGEST GIRL A CHILD OF SIX WHOM OTHERS THOUGHT HER TWONAUGHTIEST CHILDREN. THE MOTHERS EYES ARE NOT ALWAYS DECEIVED IN THEIRPARTIALITY SHE AT LEAST CAN BEST JUDGE WHO IS THE TENDERFILIALHEARTED CHILD. AND FRED WAS CERTAINLY VERY FOND OF HIS MOTHER.PERHAPS IT WAS HIS FONDNESS FOR ANOTHER PERSON ALSO THAT MADE HIMPARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO TAKE SOME SECURITY AGAINST HIS OWN LIABILITY TOSPEND THE HUNDRED POUNDS. FOR THE CREDITOR TO WHOM HE OWED A HUNDREDAND SIXTY HELD A FIRMER SECURITY IN THE SHAPE OF A BILL SIGNED BYMARYS FATHER.CHAPTER XV.BLACK EYES YOU HAVE LEFT YOU SAY    BLUE EYES FAIL TO DRAW YOUYET YOU SEEM MORE RAPT TODAY    THAN OF OLD WE SAW YOU.OH I TRACK THE FAIREST FAIR    THROUGH NEW HAUNTS OF PLEASUREFOOTPRINTS HERE AND ECHOES THERE    GUIDE ME TO MY TREASURELO SHE TURNSIMMORTAL YOUTH    WROUGHT TO MORTAL STATUREFRESH AS STARLIGHTS AGED TRUTH    MANYNAMD NATUREA GREAT HISTORIAN AS HE INSISTED ON CALLING HIMSELF WHO HAD THEHAPPINESS TO BE DEAD A HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS AGO AND SO TO TAKE HISPLACE AMONG THE COLOSSI WHOSE HUGE LEGS OUR LIVING PETTINESS ISOBSERVED TO WALK UNDER GLORIES IN HIS COPIOUS REMARKS AND DIGRESSIONSAS THE LEAST IMITABLE PART OF HIS WORK AND ESPECIALLY IN THOSE INITIALCHAPTERS TO THE SUCCESSIVE BOOKS OF HIS HISTORY WHERE HE SEEMS TOBRING HIS ARMCHAIR TO THE PROSCENIUM AND CHAT WITH US IN ALL THE LUSTYEASE OF HIS FINE ENGLISH. BUT FIELDING LIVED WHEN THE DAYS WERE LONGERFOR TIME LIKE MONEY IS MEASURED BY OUR NEEDS WHEN SUMMERAFTERNOONS WERE SPACIOUS AND THE CLOCK TICKED SLOWLY IN THE WINTEREVENINGS. WE BELATED HISTORIANS MUST NOT LINGER AFTER HIS EXAMPLE ANDIF WE DID SO IT IS PROBABLE THAT OUR CHAT WOULD BE THIN AND EAGER ASIF DELIVERED FROM A CAMPSTOOL IN A PARROTHOUSE. I AT LEAST HAVE SOMUCH TO DO IN UNRAVELING CERTAIN HUMAN LOTS AND SEEING HOW THEY WEREWOVEN AND INTERWOVEN THAT ALL THE LIGHT I CAN COMMAND MUST BECONCENTRATED ON THIS PARTICULAR WEB AND NOT DISPERSED OVER THATTEMPTING RANGE OF RELEVANCIES CALLED THE UNIVERSE.AT PRESENT I HAVE TO MAKE THE NEW SETTLER LYDGATE BETTER KNOWN TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN HIM THAN HE COULD POSSIBLY BE EVEN TO THOSE WHO HADSEEN THE MOST OF HIM SINCE HIS ARRIVAL IN MIDDLEMARCH. FOR SURELY ALLMUST ADMIT THAT A MAN MAY BE PUFFED AND BELAUDED ENVIED RIDICULEDCOUNTED UPON AS A TOOL AND FALLEN IN LOVE WITH OR AT LEAST SELECTED ASA FUTURE HUSBAND AND YET REMAIN VIRTUALLY UNKNOWNKNOWN MERELY AS ACLUSTER OF SIGNS FOR HIS NEIGHBORS FALSE SUPPOSITIONS. THERE WAS AGENERAL IMPRESSION HOWEVER THAT LYDGATE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER A COMMONCOUNTRY DOCTOR AND IN MIDDLEMARCH AT THAT TIME SUCH AN IMPRESSION WASSIGNIFICANT OF GREAT THINGS BEING EXPECTED FROM HIM. FOR EVERYBODYSFAMILY DOCTOR WAS REMARKABLY CLEVER AND WAS UNDERSTOOD TO HAVEIMMEASURABLE SKILL IN THE MANAGEMENT AND TRAINING OF THE MOST SKITTISHOR VICIOUS DISEASES. THE EVIDENCE OF HIS CLEVERNESS WAS OF THE HIGHERINTUITIVE ORDER LYING IN HIS LADYPATIENTS IMMOVABLE CONVICTION ANDWAS UNASSAILABLE BY ANY OBJECTION EXCEPT THAT THEIR INTUITIONS WEREOPPOSED BY OTHERS EQUALLY STRONG EACH LADY WHO SAW MEDICAL TRUTH INWRENCH AND THE STRENGTHENING TREATMENT REGARDING TOLLER AND THELOWERING SYSTEM AS MEDICAL PERDITION. FOR THE HEROIC TIMES OF COPIOUSBLEEDING AND BLISTERING HAD NOT YET DEPARTED STILL LESS THE TIMES OFTHOROUGHGOING THEORY WHEN DISEASE IN GENERAL WAS CALLED BY SOME BADNAME AND TREATED ACCORDINGLY WITHOUT SHILLYSHALLYAS IF FOR EXAMPLEIT WERE TO BE CALLED INSURRECTION WHICH MUST NOT BE FIRED ON WITHBLANKCARTRIDGE BUT HAVE ITS BLOOD DRAWN AT ONCE. THE STRENGTHENERSAND THE LOWERERS WERE ALL CLEVER MEN IN SOMEBODYS OPINION WHICH ISREALLY AS MUCH AS CAN BE SAID FOR ANY LIVING TALENTS. NOBODYSIMAGINATION HAD GONE SO FAR AS TO CONJECTURE THAT MR. LYDGATE COULDKNOW AS MUCH AS DR. SPRAGUE AND DR. MINCHIN THE TWO PHYSICIANS WHOALONE COULD OFFER ANY HOPE WHEN DANGER WAS EXTREME AND WHEN THESMALLEST HOPE WAS WORTH A GUINEA. STILL I REPEAT THERE WAS A GENERALIMPRESSION THAT LYDGATE WAS SOMETHING RATHER MORE UNCOMMON THAN ANYGENERAL PRACTITIONER IN MIDDLEMARCH. AND THIS WAS TRUE. HE WAS BUTSEVENANDTWENTY AN AGE AT WHICH MANY MEN ARE NOT QUITE COMMONATWHICH THEY ARE HOPEFUL OF ACHIEVEMENT RESOLUTE IN AVOIDANCE THINKINGTHAT MAMMON SHALL NEVER PUT A BIT IN THEIR MOUTHS AND GET ASTRIDE THEIRBACKS BUT RATHER THAT MAMMON IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIMSHALL DRAW THEIR CHARIOT.HE HAD BEEN LEFT AN ORPHAN WHEN HE WAS FRESH FROM A PUBLIC SCHOOL. HISFATHER A MILITARY MAN HAD MADE BUT LITTLE PROVISION FOR THREECHILDREN AND WHEN THE BOY TERTIUS ASKED TO HAVE A MEDICAL EDUCATIONIT SEEMED EASIER TO HIS GUARDIANS TO GRANT HIS REQUEST BY APPRENTICINGHIM TO A COUNTRY PRACTITIONER THAN TO MAKE ANY OBJECTIONS ON THE SCOREOF FAMILY DIGNITY. HE WAS ONE OF THE RARER LADS WHO EARLY GET A DECIDEDBENT AND MAKE UP THEIR MINDS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING PARTICULAR IN LIFEWHICH THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND NOT BECAUSE THEIRFATHERS DID IT. MOST OF US WHO TURN TO ANY SUBJECT WITH LOVE REMEMBERSOME MORNING OR EVENING HOUR WHEN WE GOT ON A HIGH STOOL TO REACH DOWNAN UNTRIED VOLUME OR SAT WITH PARTED LIPS LISTENING TO A NEW TALKEROR FOR VERY LACK OF BOOKS BEGAN TO LISTEN TO THE VOICES WITHIN AS THEFIRST TRACEABLE BEGINNING OF OUR LOVE. SOMETHING OF THAT SORT HAPPENEDTO LYDGATE. HE WAS A QUICK FELLOW AND WHEN HOT FROM PLAY WOULD TOSSHIMSELF IN A CORNER AND IN FIVE MINUTES BE DEEP IN ANY SORT OF BOOKTHAT HE COULD LAY HIS HANDS ON IF IT WERE RASSELAS OR GULLIVER SOMUCH THE BETTER BUT BAILEYS DICTIONARY WOULD DO OR THE BIBLE WITHTHE APOCRYPHA IN IT. SOMETHING HE MUST READ WHEN HE WAS NOT RIDING THEPONY OR RUNNING AND HUNTING OR LISTENING TO THE TALK OF MEN. ALL THISWAS TRUE OF HIM AT TEN YEARS OF AGE HE HAD THEN READ THROUGH CHRYSALOR THE ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA WHICH WAS NEITHER MILK FOR BABES NORANY CHALKY MIXTURE MEANT TO PASS FOR MILK AND IT HAD ALREADY OCCURREDTO HIM THAT BOOKS WERE STUFF AND THAT LIFE WAS STUPID. HIS SCHOOLSTUDIES HAD NOT MUCH MODIFIED THAT OPINION FOR THOUGH HE DID HISCLASSICS AND MATHEMATICS HE WAS NOT PREEMINENT IN THEM. IT WAS SAIDOF HIM THAT LYDGATE COULD DO ANYTHING HE LIKED BUT HE HAD CERTAINLYNOT YET LIKED TO DO ANYTHING REMARKABLE. HE WAS A VIGOROUS ANIMAL WITHA READY UNDERSTANDING BUT NO SPARK HAD YET KINDLED IN HIM ANINTELLECTUAL PASSION KNOWLEDGE SEEMED TO HIM A VERY SUPERFICIALAFFAIR EASILY MASTERED JUDGING FROM THE CONVERSATION OF HIS ELDERSHE HAD APPARENTLY GOT ALREADY MORE THAN WAS NECESSARY FOR MATURE LIFE.PROBABLY THIS WAS NOT AN EXCEPTIONAL RESULT OF EXPENSIVE TEACHING ATTHAT PERIOD OF SHORTWAISTED COATS AND OTHER FASHIONS WHICH HAVE NOTYET RECURRED. BUT ONE VACATION A WET DAY SENT HIM TO THE SMALL HOMELIBRARY TO HUNT ONCE MORE FOR A BOOK WHICH MIGHT HAVE SOME FRESHNESSFOR HIM IN VAIN UNLESS INDEED HE TOOK DOWN A DUSTY ROW OF VOLUMESWITH GRAYPAPER BACKS AND DINGY LABELSTHE VOLUMES OF AN OLDCYCLOPAEDIA WHICH HE HAD NEVER DISTURBED. IT WOULD AT LEAST BE ANOVELTY TO DISTURB THEM. THEY WERE ON THE HIGHEST SHELF AND HE STOODON A CHAIR TO GET THEM DOWN. BUT HE OPENED THE VOLUME WHICH HE FIRSTTOOK FROM THE SHELF SOMEHOW ONE IS APT TO READ IN A MAKESHIFTATTITUDE JUST WHERE IT MIGHT SEEM INCONVENIENT TO DO SO. THE PAGE HEOPENED ON WAS UNDER THE HEAD OF ANATOMY AND THE FIRST PASSAGE THATDREW HIS EYES WAS ON THE VALVES OF THE HEART. HE WAS NOT MUCHACQUAINTED WITH VALVES OF ANY SORT BUT HE KNEW THAT VALVAE WEREFOLDINGDOORS AND THROUGH THIS CREVICE CAME A SUDDEN LIGHT STARTLINGHIM WITH HIS FIRST VIVID NOTION OF FINELY ADJUSTED MECHANISM IN THEHUMAN FRAME. A LIBERAL EDUCATION HAD OF COURSE LEFT HIM FREE TO READTHE INDECENT PASSAGES IN THE SCHOOL CLASSICS BUT BEYOND A GENERALSENSE OF SECRECY AND OBSCENITY IN CONNECTION WITH HIS INTERNALSTRUCTURE HAD LEFT HIS IMAGINATION QUITE UNBIASSED SO THAT FORANYTHING HE KNEW HIS BRAINS LAY IN SMALL BAGS AT HIS TEMPLES AND HEHAD NO MORE THOUGHT OF REPRESENTING TO HIMSELF HOW HIS BLOOD CIRCULATEDTHAN HOW PAPER SERVED INSTEAD OF GOLD. BUT THE MOMENT OF VOCATION HADCOME AND BEFORE HE GOT DOWN FROM HIS CHAIR THE WORLD WAS MADE NEW TOHIM BY A PRESENTIMENT OF ENDLESS PROCESSES FILLING THE VAST SPACESPLANKED OUT OF HIS SIGHT BY THAT WORDY IGNORANCE WHICH HE HAD SUPPOSEDTO BE KNOWLEDGE. FROM THAT HOUR LYDGATE FELT THE GROWTH OF ANINTELLECTUAL PASSION.WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF TELLING OVER AND OVER AGAIN HOW A MAN COMES TOFALL IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN AND BE WEDDED TO HER OR ELSE BE FATALLYPARTED FROM HER. IS IT DUE TO EXCESS OF POETRY OR OF STUPIDITY THAT WEARE NEVER WEARY OF DESCRIBING WHAT KING JAMES CALLED A WOMANS MAKDOMAND HER FAIRNESSE NEVER WEARY OF LISTENING TO THE TWANGING OF THE OLDTROUBADOUR STRINGS AND ARE COMPARATIVELY UNINTERESTED IN THAT OTHERKIND OF MAKDOM AND FAIRNESSE WHICH MUST BE WOOED WITH INDUSTRIOUSTHOUGHT AND PATIENT RENUNCIATION OF SMALL DESIRES IN THE STORY OF THISPASSION TOO THE DEVELOPMENT VARIES SOMETIMES IT IS THE GLORIOUSMARRIAGE SOMETIMES FRUSTRATION AND FINAL PARTING. AND NOT SELDOM THECATASTROPHE IS BOUND UP WITH THE OTHER PASSION SUNG BY THETROUBADOURS. FOR IN THE MULTITUDE OF MIDDLEAGED MEN WHO GO ABOUT THEIRVOCATIONS IN A DAILY COURSE DETERMINED FOR THEM MUCH IN THE SAME WAY ASTHE TIE OF THEIR CRAVATS THERE IS ALWAYS A GOOD NUMBER WHO ONCE MEANTTO SHAPE THEIR OWN DEEDS AND ALTER THE WORLD A LITTLE. THE STORY OFTHEIR COMING TO BE SHAPEN AFTER THE AVERAGE AND FIT TO BE PACKED BY THEGROSS IS HARDLY EVER TOLD EVEN IN THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS FOR PERHAPSTHEIR ARDOR IN GENEROUS UNPAID TOIL COOLED AS IMPERCEPTIBLY AS THEARDOR OF OTHER YOUTHFUL LOVES TILL ONE DAY THEIR EARLIER SELF WALKEDLIKE A GHOST IN ITS OLD HOME AND MADE THE NEW FURNITURE GHASTLY.NOTHING IN THE WORLD MORE SUBTLE THAN THE PROCESS OF THEIR GRADUALCHANGE IN THE BEGINNING THEY INHALED IT UNKNOWINGLY YOU AND I MAYHAVE SENT SOME OF OUR BREATH TOWARDS INFECTING THEM WHEN WE UTTEREDOUR CONFORMING FALSITIES OR DREW OUR SILLY CONCLUSIONS OR PERHAPS ITCAME WITH THE VIBRATIONS FROM A WOMANS GLANCE.LYDGATE DID NOT MEAN TO BE ONE OF THOSE FAILURES AND THERE WAS THEBETTER HOPE OF HIM BECAUSE HIS SCIENTIFIC INTEREST SOON TOOK THE FORMOF A PROFESSIONAL ENTHUSIASM HE HAD A YOUTHFUL BELIEF IN HISBREADWINNING WORK NOT TO BE STIFLED BY THAT INITIATION IN MAKESHIFTCALLED HIS PRENTICE DAYS AND HE CARRIED TO HIS STUDIES IN LONDONEDINBURGH AND PARIS THE CONVICTION THAT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION AS ITMIGHT BE WAS THE FINEST IN THE WORLD PRESENTING THE MOST PERFECTINTERCHANGE BETWEEN SCIENCE AND ART OFFERING THE MOST DIRECT ALLIANCEBETWEEN INTELLECTUAL CONQUEST AND THE SOCIAL GOOD. LYDGATES NATUREDEMANDED THIS COMBINATION HE WAS AN EMOTIONAL CREATURE WITH AFLESHANDBLOOD SENSE OF FELLOWSHIP WHICH WITHSTOOD ALL THEABSTRACTIONS OF SPECIAL STUDY. HE CARED NOT ONLY FOR CASES BUT FORJOHN AND ELIZABETH ESPECIALLY ELIZABETH.THERE WAS ANOTHER ATTRACTION IN HIS PROFESSION IT WANTED REFORM ANDGAVE A MAN AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME INDIGNANT RESOLVE TO REJECT ITSVENAL DECORATIONS AND OTHER HUMBUG AND TO BE THE POSSESSOR OF GENUINETHOUGH UNDEMANDED QUALIFICATIONS. HE WENT TO STUDY IN PARIS WITH THEDETERMINATION THAT WHEN HE CAME HOME AGAIN HE WOULD SETTLE IN SOMEPROVINCIAL TOWN AS A GENERAL PRACTITIONER AND RESIST THE IRRATIONALSEVERANCE BETWEEN MEDICAL AND SURGICAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE INTEREST OF HISOWN SCIENTIFIC PURSUITS AS WELL AS OF THE GENERAL ADVANCE HE WOULDKEEP AWAY FROM THE RANGE OF LONDON INTRIGUES JEALOUSIES AND SOCIALTRUCKLING AND WIN CELEBRITY HOWEVER SLOWLY AS JENNER HAD DONE BYTHE INDEPENDENT VALUE OF HIS WORK. FOR IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THISWAS A DARK PERIOD AND IN SPITE OF VENERABLE COLLEGES WHICH USED GREATEFFORTS TO SECURE PURITY OF KNOWLEDGE BY MAKING IT SCARCE AND TOEXCLUDE ERROR BY A RIGID EXCLUSIVENESS IN RELATION TO FEES ANDAPPOINTMENTS IT HAPPENED THAT VERY IGNORANT YOUNG GENTLEMEN WEREPROMOTED IN TOWN AND MANY MORE GOT A LEGAL RIGHT TO PRACTISE OVERLARGE AREAS IN THE COUNTRY. ALSO THE HIGH STANDARD HELD UP TO THEPUBLIC MIND BY THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS WHICH GAVE ITS PECULIARSANCTION TO THE EXPENSIVE AND HIGHLY RAREFIED MEDICAL INSTRUCTIONOBTAINED BY GRADUATES OF OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE DID NOT HINDER QUACKERYFROM HAVING AN EXCELLENT TIME OF IT FOR SINCE PROFESSIONAL PRACTICECHIEFLY CONSISTED IN GIVING A GREAT MANY DRUGS THE PUBLIC INFERREDTHAT IT MIGHT BE BETTER OFF WITH MORE DRUGS STILL IF THEY COULD ONLYBE GOT CHEAPLY AND HENCE SWALLOWED LARGE CUBIC MEASURES OF PHYSICPRESCRIBED BY UNSCRUPULOUS IGNORANCE WHICH HAD TAKEN NO DEGREES.CONSIDERING THAT STATISTICS HAD NOT YET EMBRACED A CALCULATION AS TOTHE NUMBER OF IGNORANT OR CANTING DOCTORS WHICH ABSOLUTELY MUST EXISTIN THE TEETH OF ALL CHANGES IT SEEMED TO LYDGATE THAT A CHANGE IN THEUNITS WAS THE MOST DIRECT MODE OF CHANGING THE NUMBERS. HE MEANT TO BEA UNIT WHO WOULD MAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE TOWARDS THATSPREADING CHANGE WHICH WOULD ONE DAY TELL APPRECIABLY UPON THEAVERAGES AND IN THE MEAN TIME HAVE THE PLEASURE OF MAKING ANADVANTAGEOUS DIFFERENCE TO THE VISCERA OF HIS OWN PATIENTS. BUT HE DIDNOT SIMPLY AIM AT A MORE GENUINE KIND OF PRACTICE THAN WAS COMMON. HEWAS AMBITIOUS OF A WIDER EFFECT HE WAS FIRED WITH THE POSSIBILITY THATHE MIGHT WORK OUT THE PROOF OF AN ANATOMICAL CONCEPTION AND MAKE A LINKIN THE CHAIN OF DISCOVERY.DOES IT SEEM INCONGRUOUS TO YOU THAT A MIDDLEMARCH SURGEON SHOULD DREAMOF HIMSELF AS A DISCOVERER MOST OF US INDEED KNOW LITTLE OF THEGREAT ORIGINATORS UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN LIFTED UP AMONG THECONSTELLATIONS AND ALREADY RULE OUR FATES. BUT THAT HERSCHEL FOREXAMPLE WHO BROKE THE BARRIERS OF THE HEAVENSDID HE NOT ONCE PLAY APROVINCIAL CHURCHORGAN AND GIVE MUSICLESSONS TO STUMBLING PIANISTSEACH OF THOSE SHINING ONES HAD TO WALK ON THE EARTH AMONG NEIGHBORS WHOPERHAPS THOUGHT MUCH MORE OF HIS GAIT AND HIS GARMENTS THAN OF ANYTHINGWHICH WAS TO GIVE HIM A TITLE TO EVERLASTING FAME EACH OF THEM HAD HISLITTLE LOCAL PERSONAL HISTORY SPRINKLED WITH SMALL TEMPTATIONS ANDSORDID CARES WHICH MADE THE RETARDING FRICTION OF HIS COURSE TOWARDSFINAL COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE IMMORTALS. LYDGATE WAS NOT BLIND TO THEDANGERS OF SUCH FRICTION BUT HE HAD PLENTY OF CONFIDENCE IN HISRESOLUTION TO AVOID IT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE BEING SEVENANDTWENTY HEFELT HIMSELF EXPERIENCED. AND HE WAS NOT GOING TO HAVE HIS VANITIESPROVOKED BY CONTACT WITH THE SHOWY WORLDLY SUCCESSES OF THE CAPITALBUT TO LIVE AMONG PEOPLE WHO COULD HOLD NO RIVALRY WITH THAT PURSUIT OFA GREAT IDEA WHICH WAS TO BE A TWIN OBJECT WITH THE ASSIDUOUS PRACTICEOF HIS PROFESSION. THERE WAS FASCINATION IN THE HOPE THAT THE TWOPURPOSES WOULD ILLUMINATE EACH OTHER THE CAREFUL OBSERVATION ANDINFERENCE WHICH WAS HIS DAILY WORK THE USE OF THE LENS TO FURTHER HISJUDGMENT IN SPECIAL CASES WOULD FURTHER HIS THOUGHT AS AN INSTRUMENTOF LARGER INQUIRY. WAS NOT THIS THE TYPICAL PREEMINENCE OF HISPROFESSION HE WOULD BE A GOOD MIDDLEMARCH DOCTOR AND BY THAT VERYMEANS KEEP HIMSELF IN THE TRACK OF FARREACHING INVESTIGATION. ON ONEPOINT HE MAY FAIRLY CLAIM APPROVAL AT THIS PARTICULAR STAGE OF HISCAREER HE DID NOT MEAN TO IMITATE THOSE PHILANTHROPIC MODELS WHO MAKEA PROFIT OUT OF POISONOUS PICKLES TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES WHILE THEY AREEXPOSING ADULTERATION OR HOLD SHARES IN A GAMBLINGHELL THAT THEY MAYHAVE LEISURE TO REPRESENT THE CAUSE OF PUBLIC MORALITY. HE INTENDED TOBEGIN IN HIS OWN CASE SOME PARTICULAR REFORMS WHICH WERE QUITECERTAINLY WITHIN HIS REACH AND MUCH LESS OF A PROBLEM THAN THEDEMONSTRATING OF AN ANATOMICAL CONCEPTION. ONE OF THESE REFORMS WAS TOACT STOUTLY ON THE STRENGTH OF A RECENT LEGAL DECISION AND SIMPLYPRESCRIBE WITHOUT DISPENSING DRUGS OR TAKING PERCENTAGE FROMDRUGGISTS. THIS WAS AN INNOVATION FOR ONE WHO HAD CHOSEN TO ADOPT THESTYLE OF GENERAL PRACTITIONER IN A COUNTRY TOWN AND WOULD BE FELT ASOFFENSIVE CRITICISM BY HIS PROFESSIONAL BRETHREN. BUT LYDGATE MEANT TOINNOVATE IN HIS TREATMENT ALSO AND HE WAS WISE ENOUGH TO SEE THAT THEBEST SECURITY FOR HIS PRACTISING HONESTLY ACCORDING TO HIS BELIEF WASTO GET RID OF SYSTEMATIC TEMPTATIONS TO THE CONTRARY.PERHAPS THAT WAS A MORE CHEERFUL TIME FOR OBSERVERS AND THEORIZERS THANTHE PRESENT WE ARE APT TO THINK IT THE FINEST ERA OF THE WORLD WHENAMERICA WAS BEGINNING TO BE DISCOVERED WHEN A BOLD SAILOR EVEN IF HEWERE WRECKED MIGHT ALIGHT ON A NEW KINGDOM AND ABOUT  THE DARKTERRITORIES OF PATHOLOGY WERE A FINE AMERICA FOR A SPIRITED YOUNGADVENTURER. LYDGATE WAS AMBITIOUS ABOVE ALL TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDSENLARGING THE SCIENTIFIC RATIONAL BASIS OF HIS PROFESSION. THE MORE HEBECAME INTERESTED IN SPECIAL QUESTIONS OF DISEASE SUCH AS THE NATUREOF FEVER OR FEVERS THE MORE KEENLY HE FELT THE NEED FOR THATFUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE OF STRUCTURE WHICH JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF THECENTURY HAD BEEN ILLUMINATED BY THE BRIEF AND GLORIOUS CAREER OFBICHAT WHO DIED WHEN HE WAS ONLY ONEANDTHIRTY BUT LIKE ANOTHERALEXANDER LEFT A REALM LARGE ENOUGH FOR MANY HEIRS. THAT GREATFRENCHMAN FIRST CARRIED OUT THE CONCEPTION THAT LIVING BODIESFUNDAMENTALLY CONSIDERED ARE NOT ASSOCIATIONS OF ORGANS WHICH CAN BEUNDERSTOOD BY STUDYING THEM FIRST APART AND THEN AS IT WERE FEDERALLYBUT MUST BE REGARDED AS CONSISTING OF CERTAIN PRIMARY WEBS OR TISSUESOUT OF WHICH THE VARIOUS ORGANSBRAIN HEART LUNGS AND SO ONARECOMPACTED AS THE VARIOUS ACCOMMODATIONS OF A HOUSE ARE BUILT UP INVARIOUS PROPORTIONS OF WOOD IRON STONE BRICK ZINC AND THE RESTEACH MATERIAL HAVING ITS PECULIAR COMPOSITION AND PROPORTIONS. NO MANONE SEES CAN UNDERSTAND AND ESTIMATE THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OR ITSPARTSWHAT ARE ITS FRAILTIES AND WHAT ITS REPAIRS WITHOUT KNOWING THENATURE OF THE MATERIALS. AND THE CONCEPTION WROUGHT OUT BY BICHAT WITHHIS DETAILED STUDY OF THE DIFFERENT TISSUES ACTED NECESSARILY ONMEDICAL QUESTIONS AS THE TURNING OF GASLIGHT WOULD ACT ON A DIMOILLIT STREET SHOWING NEW CONNECTIONS AND HITHERTO HIDDEN FACTS OFSTRUCTURE WHICH MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN CONSIDERING THE SYMPTOMSOF MALADIES AND THE ACTION OF MEDICAMENTS. BUT RESULTS WHICH DEPEND ONHUMAN CONSCIENCE AND INTELLIGENCE WORK SLOWLY AND NOW AT THE END OF MOST MEDICAL PRACTICE WAS STILL STRUTTING OR SHAMBLING ALONG THEOLD PATHS AND THERE WAS STILL SCIENTIFIC WORK TO BE DONE WHICH MIGHTHAVE SEEMED TO BE A DIRECT SEQUENCE OF BICHATS. THIS GREAT SEER DIDNOT GO BEYOND THE CONSIDERATION OF THE TISSUES AS ULTIMATE FACTS IN THELIVING ORGANISM MARKING THE LIMIT OF ANATOMICAL ANALYSIS BUT IT WASOPEN TO ANOTHER MIND TO SAY HAVE NOT THESE STRUCTURES SOME COMMONBASIS FROM WHICH THEY HAVE ALL STARTED AS YOUR SARSNET GAUZE NETSATIN AND VELVET FROM THE RAW COCOON HERE WOULD BE ANOTHER LIGHT ASOF OXYHYDROGEN SHOWING THE VERY GRAIN OF THINGS AND REVISING ALLFORMER EXPLANATIONS. OF THIS SEQUENCE TO BICHATS WORK ALREADYVIBRATING ALONG MANY CURRENTS OF THE EUROPEAN MIND LYDGATE WASENAMOURED HE LONGED TO DEMONSTRATE THE MORE INTIMATE RELATIONS OFLIVING STRUCTURE AND HELP TO DEFINE MENS THOUGHT MORE ACCURATELYAFTER THE TRUE ORDER. THE WORK HAD NOT YET BEEN DONE BUT ONLY PREPAREDFOR THOSE WHO KNEW HOW TO USE THE PREPARATION. WHAT WAS THE PRIMITIVETISSUE IN THAT WAY LYDGATE PUT THE QUESTIONNOT QUITE IN THE WAYREQUIRED BY THE AWAITING ANSWER BUT SUCH MISSING OF THE RIGHT WORDBEFALLS MANY SEEKERS. AND HE COUNTED ON QUIET INTERVALS TO BEWATCHFULLY SEIZED FOR TAKING UP THE THREADS OF INVESTIGATIONON MANYHINTS TO BE WON FROM DILIGENT APPLICATION NOT ONLY OF THE SCALPEL BUTOF THE MICROSCOPE WHICH RESEARCH HAD BEGUN TO USE AGAIN WITH NEWENTHUSIASM OF RELIANCE. SUCH WAS LYDGATES PLAN OF HIS FUTURE TO DOGOOD SMALL WORK FOR MIDDLEMARCH AND GREAT WORK FOR THE WORLD.HE WAS CERTAINLY A HAPPY FELLOW AT THIS TIME TO BE SEVENANDTWENTYWITHOUT ANY FIXED VICES WITH A GENEROUS RESOLUTION THAT HIS ACTIONSHOULD BE BENEFICENT AND WITH IDEAS IN HIS BRAIN THAT MADE LIFEINTERESTING QUITE APART FROM THE CULTUS OF HORSEFLESH AND OTHER MYSTICRITES OF COSTLY OBSERVANCE WHICH THE EIGHT HUNDRED POUNDS LEFT HIMAFTER BUYING HIS PRACTICE WOULD CERTAINLY NOT HAVE GONE FAR IN PAYINGFOR. HE WAS AT A STARTINGPOINT WHICH MAKES MANY A MANS CAREER A FINESUBJECT FOR BETTING IF THERE WERE ANY GENTLEMEN GIVEN TO THATAMUSEMENT WHO COULD APPRECIATE THE COMPLICATED PROBABILITIES OF ANARDUOUS PURPOSE WITH ALL THE POSSIBLE THWARTINGS AND FURTHERINGS OFCIRCUMSTANCE ALL THE NICETIES OF INWARD BALANCE BY WHICH A MAN SWIMSAND MAKES HIS POINT OR ELSE IS CARRIED HEADLONG. THE RISK WOULD REMAINEVEN WITH CLOSE KNOWLEDGE OF LYDGATES CHARACTER FOR CHARACTER TOO ISA PROCESS AND AN UNFOLDING. THE MAN WAS STILL IN THE MAKING AS MUCH ASTHE MIDDLEMARCH DOCTOR AND IMMORTAL DISCOVERER AND THERE WERE BOTHVIRTUES AND FAULTS CAPABLE OF SHRINKING OR EXPANDING. THE FAULTS WILLNOT I HOPE BE A REASON FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF YOUR INTEREST IN HIM.AMONG OUR VALUED FRIENDS IS THERE NOT SOME ONE OR OTHER WHO IS A LITTLETOO SELFCONFIDENT AND DISDAINFUL WHOSE DISTINGUISHED MIND IS A LITTLESPOTTED WITH COMMONNESS WHO IS A LITTLE PINCHED HERE AND PROTUBERANTTHERE WITH NATIVE PREJUDICES OR WHOSE BETTER ENERGIES ARE LIABLE TOLAPSE DOWN THE WRONG CHANNEL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF TRANSIENTSOLICITATIONS ALL THESE THINGS MIGHT BE ALLEGED AGAINST LYDGATE BUTTHEN THEY ARE THE PERIPHRASES OF A POLITE PREACHER WHO TALKS OF ADAMAND WOULD NOT LIKE TO MENTION ANYTHING PAINFUL TO THE PEWRENTERS. THEPARTICULAR FAULTS FROM WHICH THESE DELICATE GENERALITIES ARE DISTILLEDHAVE DISTINGUISHABLE PHYSIOGNOMIES DICTION ACCENT AND GRIMACESFILLING UP PARTS IN VERY VARIOUS DRAMAS. OUR VANITIES DIFFER AS OURNOSES DO ALL CONCEIT IS NOT THE SAME CONCEIT BUT VARIES INCORRESPONDENCE WITH THE MINUTIAE OF MENTAL MAKE IN WHICH ONE OF USDIFFERS FROM ANOTHER. LYDGATES CONCEIT WAS OF THE ARROGANT SORT NEVERSIMPERING NEVER IMPERTINENT BUT MASSIVE IN ITS CLAIMS ANDBENEVOLENTLY CONTEMPTUOUS. HE WOULD DO A GREAT DEAL FOR NOODLES BEINGSORRY FOR THEM AND FEELING QUITE SURE THAT THEY COULD HAVE NO POWEROVER HIM HE HAD THOUGHT OF JOINING THE SAINT SIMONIANS WHEN HE WAS INPARIS IN ORDER TO TURN THEM AGAINST SOME OF THEIR OWN DOCTRINES. ALLHIS FAULTS WERE MARKED BY KINDRED TRAITS AND WERE THOSE OF A MAN WHOHAD A FINE BARITONE WHOSE CLOTHES HUNG WELL UPON HIM AND WHO EVEN INHIS ORDINARY GESTURES HAD AN AIR OF INBRED DISTINCTION. WHERE THEN LAYTHE SPOTS OF COMMONNESS SAYS A YOUNG LADY ENAMOURED OF THAT CARELESSGRACE. HOW COULD THERE BE ANY COMMONNESS IN A MAN SO WELLBRED SOAMBITIOUS OF SOCIAL DISTINCTION SO GENEROUS AND UNUSUAL IN HIS VIEWSOF SOCIAL DUTY AS EASILY AS THERE MAY BE STUPIDITY IN A MAN OF GENIUSIF YOU TAKE HIM UNAWARES ON THE WRONG SUBJECT OR AS MANY A MAN WHO HASTHE BEST WILL TO ADVANCE THE SOCIAL MILLENNIUM MIGHT BE ILLINSPIRED INIMAGINING ITS LIGHTER PLEASURES UNABLE TO GO BEYOND OFFENBACHS MUSICOR THE BRILLIANT PUNNING IN THE LAST BURLESQUE. LYDGATES SPOTS OFCOMMONNESS LAY IN THE COMPLEXION OF HIS PREJUDICES WHICH IN SPITE OFNOBLE INTENTION AND SYMPATHY WERE HALF OF THEM SUCH AS ARE FOUND INORDINARY MEN OF THE WORLD THAT DISTINCTION OF MIND WHICH BELONGED TOHIS INTELLECTUAL ARDOR DID NOT PENETRATE HIS FEELING AND JUDGMENTABOUT FURNITURE OR WOMEN OR THE DESIRABILITY OF ITS BEING KNOWNWITHOUT HIS TELLING THAT HE WAS BETTER BORN THAN OTHER COUNTRYSURGEONS. HE DID NOT MEAN TO THINK OF FURNITURE AT PRESENT BUTWHENEVER HE DID SO IT WAS TO BE FEARED THAT NEITHER BIOLOGY NOR SCHEMESOF REFORM WOULD LIFT HIM ABOVE THE VULGARITY OF FEELING THAT THEREWOULD BE AN INCOMPATIBILITY IN HIS FURNITURE NOT BEING OF THE BEST.AS TO WOMEN HE HAD ONCE ALREADY BEEN DRAWN HEADLONG BY IMPETUOUSFOLLY WHICH HE MEANT TO BE FINAL SINCE MARRIAGE AT SOME DISTANTPERIOD WOULD OF COURSE NOT BE IMPETUOUS. FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO BEACQUAINTED WITH LYDGATE IT WILL BE GOOD TO KNOW WHAT WAS THAT CASE OFIMPETUOUS FOLLY FOR IT MAY STAND AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE FITFUL SWERVINGOF PASSION TO WHICH HE WAS PRONE TOGETHER WITH THE CHIVALROUS KINDNESSWHICH HELPED TO MAKE HIM MORALLY LOVABLE. THE STORY CAN BE TOLD WITHOUTMANY WORDS. IT HAPPENED WHEN HE WAS STUDYING IN PARIS AND JUST AT THETIME WHEN OVER AND ABOVE HIS OTHER WORK HE WAS OCCUPIED WITH SOMEGALVANIC EXPERIMENTS. ONE EVENING TIRED WITH HIS EXPERIMENTING ANDNOT BEING ABLE TO ELICIT THE FACTS HE NEEDED HE LEFT HIS FROGS ANDRABBITS TO SOME REPOSE UNDER THEIR TRYING AND MYSTERIOUS DISPENSATIONOF UNEXPLAINED SHOCKS AND WENT TO FINISH HIS EVENING AT THE THEATRE OFTHE PORTE SAINT MARTIN WHERE THERE WAS A MELODRAMA WHICH HE HADALREADY SEEN SEVERAL TIMES ATTRACTED NOT BY THE INGENIOUS WORK OF THECOLLABORATING AUTHORS BUT BY AN ACTRESS WHOSE PART IT WAS TO STAB HERLOVER MISTAKING HIM FOR THE EVILDESIGNING DUKE OF THE PIECE. LYDGATEWAS IN LOVE WITH THIS ACTRESS AS A MAN IS IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN WHOM HENEVER EXPECTS TO SPEAK TO. SHE WAS A PROVENCALE WITH DARK EYES AGREEK PROFILE AND ROUNDED MAJESTIC FORM HAVING THAT SORT OF BEAUTYWHICH CARRIES A SWEET MATRONLINESS EVEN IN YOUTH AND HER VOICE WAS ASOFT COOING. SHE HAD BUT LATELY COME TO PARIS AND BORE A VIRTUOUSREPUTATION HER HUSBAND ACTING WITH HER AS THE UNFORTUNATE LOVER. ITWAS HER ACTING WHICH WAS NO BETTER THAN IT SHOULD BE BUT THE PUBLICWAS SATISFIED. LYDGATES ONLY RELAXATION NOW WAS TO GO AND LOOK AT THISWOMAN JUST AS HE MIGHT HAVE THROWN HIMSELF UNDER THE BREATH OF THESWEET SOUTH ON A BANK OF VIOLETS FOR A WHILE WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO HISGALVANISM TO WHICH HE WOULD PRESENTLY RETURN. BUT THIS EVENING THE OLDDRAMA HAD A NEW CATASTROPHE. AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE HEROINE WAS TO ACTTHE STABBING OF HER LOVER AND HE WAS TO FALL GRACEFULLY THE WIFEVERITABLY STABBED HER HUSBAND WHO FELL AS DEATH WILLED. A WILD SHRIEKPIERCED THE HOUSE AND THE PROVENCALE FELL SWOONING A SHRIEK AND ASWOON WERE DEMANDED BY THE PLAY BUT THE SWOONING TOO WAS REAL THISTIME. LYDGATE LEAPED AND CLIMBED HE HARDLY KNEW HOW ON TO THE STAGEAND WAS ACTIVE IN HELP MAKING THE ACQUAINTANCE OF HIS HEROINE BYFINDING A CONTUSION ON HER HEAD AND LIFTING HER GENTLY IN HIS ARMS.PARIS RANG WITH THE STORY OF THIS DEATHWAS IT A MURDER SOME OF THEACTRESSS WARMEST ADMIRERS WERE INCLINED TO BELIEVE IN HER GUILT ANDLIKED HER THE BETTER FOR IT SUCH WAS THE TASTE OF THOSE TIMES BUTLYDGATE WAS NOT ONE OF THESE. HE VEHEMENTLY CONTENDED FOR HERINNOCENCE AND THE REMOTE IMPERSONAL PASSION FOR HER BEAUTY WHICH HEHAD FELT BEFORE HAD PASSED NOW INTO PERSONAL DEVOTION AND TENDERTHOUGHT OF HER LOT. THE NOTION OF MURDER WAS ABSURD NO MOTIVE WASDISCOVERABLE THE YOUNG COUPLE BEING UNDERSTOOD TO DOTE ON EACH OTHERAND IT WAS NOT UNPRECEDENTED THAT AN ACCIDENTAL SLIP OF THE FOOT SHOULDHAVE BROUGHT THESE GRAVE CONSEQUENCES. THE LEGAL INVESTIGATION ENDED INMADAME LAURES RELEASE. LYDGATE BY THIS TIME HAD HAD MANY INTERVIEWSWITH HER AND FOUND HER MORE AND MORE ADORABLE. SHE TALKED LITTLE BUTTHAT WAS AN ADDITIONAL CHARM. SHE WAS MELANCHOLY AND SEEMED GRATEFULHER PRESENCE WAS ENOUGH LIKE THAT OF THE EVENING LIGHT. LYDGATE WASMADLY ANXIOUS ABOUT HER AFFECTION AND JEALOUS LEST ANY OTHER MAN THANHIMSELF SHOULD WIN IT AND ASK HER TO MARRY HIM. BUT INSTEAD OFREOPENING HER ENGAGEMENT AT THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN WHERE SHE WOULDHAVE BEEN ALL THE MORE POPULAR FOR THE FATAL EPISODE SHE LEFT PARISWITHOUT WARNING FORSAKING HER LITTLE COURT OF ADMIRERS. PERHAPS NO ONECARRIED INQUIRY FAR EXCEPT LYDGATE WHO FELT THAT ALL SCIENCE HAD COMETO A STANDSTILL WHILE HE IMAGINED THE UNHAPPY LAURE STRICKEN BYEVERWANDERING SORROW HERSELF WANDERING AND FINDING NO FAITHFULCOMFORTER. HIDDEN ACTRESSES HOWEVER ARE NOT SO DIFFICULT TO FIND ASSOME OTHER HIDDEN FACTS AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE LYDGATE GATHEREDINDICATIONS THAT LAURE HAD TAKEN THE ROUTE TO LYONS. HE FOUND HER ATLAST ACTING WITH GREAT SUCCESS AT AVIGNON UNDER THE SAME NAME LOOKINGMORE MAJESTIC THAN EVER AS A FORSAKEN WIFE CARRYING HER CHILD IN HERARMS. HE SPOKE TO HER AFTER THE PLAY WAS RECEIVED WITH THE USUALQUIETUDE WHICH SEEMED TO HIM BEAUTIFUL AS CLEAR DEPTHS OF WATER ANDOBTAINED LEAVE TO VISIT HER THE NEXT DAY WHEN HE WAS BENT ON TELLINGHER THAT HE ADORED HER AND ON ASKING HER TO MARRY HIM. HE KNEW THATTHIS WAS LIKE THE SUDDEN IMPULSE OF A MADMANINCONGRUOUS EVEN WITH HISHABITUAL FOIBLES. NO MATTER IT WAS THE ONE THING WHICH HE WAS RESOLVEDTO DO. HE HAD TWO SELVES WITHIN HIM APPARENTLY AND THEY MUST LEARN TOACCOMMODATE EACH OTHER AND BEAR RECIPROCAL IMPEDIMENTS. STRANGE THATSOME OF US WITH QUICK ALTERNATE VISION SEE BEYOND OUR INFATUATIONSAND EVEN WHILE WE RAVE ON THE HEIGHTS BEHOLD THE WIDE PLAIN WHERE OURPERSISTENT SELF PAUSES AND AWAITS US.TO HAVE APPROACHED LAURE WITH ANY SUIT THAT WAS NOT REVERENTIALLYTENDER WOULD HAVE BEEN SIMPLY A CONTRADICTION OF HIS WHOLE FEELINGTOWARDS HER.YOU HAVE COME ALL THE WAY FROM PARIS TO FIND ME SHE SAID TO HIM THENEXT DAY SITTING BEFORE HIM WITH FOLDED ARMS AND LOOKING AT HIM WITHEYES THAT SEEMED TO WONDER AS AN UNTAMED RUMINATING ANIMAL WONDERS.ARE ALL ENGLISHMEN LIKE THATI CAME BECAUSE I COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT TRYING TO SEE YOU. YOU ARELONELY I LOVE YOU I WANT YOU TO CONSENT TO BE MY WIFE I WILL WAITBUT I WANT YOU TO PROMISE THAT YOU WILL MARRY MENO ONE ELSE.LAURE LOOKED AT HIM IN SILENCE WITH A MELANCHOLY RADIANCE FROM UNDERHER GRAND EYELIDS UNTIL HE WAS FULL OF RAPTUROUS CERTAINTY AND KNELTCLOSE TO HER KNEES.I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING SHE SAID IN HER COOING WAY KEEPING HERARMS FOLDED. MY FOOT REALLY SLIPPED.I KNOW I KNOW SAID LYDGATE DEPRECATINGLY. IT WAS A FATALACCIDENTA DREADFUL STROKE OF CALAMITY THAT BOUND ME TO YOU THE MORE.AGAIN LAURE PAUSED A LITTLE AND THEN SAID SLOWLY I MEANT TO DOIT.LYDGATE STRONG MAN AS HE WAS TURNED PALE AND TREMBLED MOMENTS SEEMEDTO PASS BEFORE HE ROSE AND STOOD AT A DISTANCE FROM HER.THERE WAS A SECRET THEN HE SAID AT LAST EVEN VEHEMENTLY. HE WASBRUTAL TO YOU YOU HATED HIM.NO HE WEARIED ME HE WAS TOO FOND HE WOULD LIVE IN PARIS AND NOT INMY COUNTRY THAT WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO ME.GREAT GOD SAID LYDGATE IN A GROAN OF HORROR. AND YOU PLANNED TOMURDER HIMI DID NOT PLAN IT CAME TO ME IN THE PLAYI MEANT TO DO IT.LYDGATE STOOD MUTE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY PRESSED HIS HAT ON WHILE HELOOKED AT HER. HE SAW THIS WOMANTHE FIRST TO WHOM HE HAD GIVEN HISYOUNG ADORATIONAMID THE THRONG OF STUPID CRIMINALS.YOU ARE A GOOD YOUNG MAN SHE SAID. BUT I DO NOT LIKE HUSBANDS. IWILL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER.THREE DAYS AFTERWARDS LYDGATE WAS AT HIS GALVANISM AGAIN IN HIS PARISCHAMBERS BELIEVING THAT ILLUSIONS WERE AT AN END FOR HIM. HE WAS SAVEDFROM HARDENING EFFECTS BY THE ABUNDANT KINDNESS OF HIS HEART AND HISBELIEF THAT HUMAN LIFE MIGHT BE MADE BETTER. BUT HE HAD MORE REASONTHAN EVER FOR TRUSTING HIS JUDGMENT NOW THAT IT WAS SO EXPERIENCEDAND HENCEFORTH HE WOULD TAKE A STRICTLY SCIENTIFIC VIEW OF WOMANENTERTAINING NO EXPECTATIONS BUT SUCH AS WERE JUSTIFIED BEFOREHAND.NO ONE IN MIDDLEMARCH WAS LIKELY TO HAVE SUCH A NOTION OF LYDGATESPAST AS HAS HERE BEEN FAINTLY SHADOWED AND INDEED THE RESPECTABLETOWNSFOLK THERE WERE NOT MORE GIVEN THAN MORTALS GENERALLY TO ANY EAGERATTEMPT AT EXACTNESS IN THE REPRESENTATION TO THEMSELVES OF WHAT DIDNOT COME UNDER THEIR OWN SENSES. NOT ONLY YOUNG VIRGINS OF THAT TOWNBUT GRAYBEARDED MEN ALSO WERE OFTEN IN HASTE TO CONJECTURE HOW A NEWACQUAINTANCE MIGHT BE WROUGHT INTO THEIR PURPOSES CONTENTED WITH VERYVAGUE KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE WAY IN WHICH LIFE HAD BEEN SHAPING HIM FORTHAT INSTRUMENTALITY. MIDDLEMARCH IN FACT COUNTED ON SWALLOWINGLYDGATE AND ASSIMILATING HIM VERY COMFORTABLY.CHAPTER XVI.ALL THAT IN WOMAN IS ADORED    IN THY FAIR SELF I FINDFOR THE WHOLE SEX CAN BUT AFFORD    THE HANDSOME AND THE KIND.SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.THE QUESTION WHETHER MR. TYKE SHOULD BE APPOINTED AS SALARIED CHAPLAINTO THE HOSPITAL WAS AN EXCITING TOPIC TO THE MIDDLEMARCHERS ANDLYDGATE HEARD IT DISCUSSED IN A WAY THAT THREW MUCH LIGHT ON THE POWEREXERCISED IN THE TOWN BY MR. BULSTRODE. THE BANKER WAS EVIDENTLY ARULER BUT THERE WAS AN OPPOSITION PARTY AND EVEN AMONG HIS SUPPORTERSTHERE WERE SOME WHO ALLOWED IT TO BE SEEN THAT THEIR SUPPORT WAS ACOMPROMISE AND WHO FRANKLY STATED THEIR IMPRESSION THAT THE GENERALSCHEME OF THINGS AND ESPECIALLY THE CASUALTIES OF TRADE REQUIRED YOUTO HOLD A CANDLE TO THE DEVIL.MR. BULSTRODES POWER WAS NOT DUE SIMPLY TO HIS BEING A COUNTRY BANKERWHO KNEW THE FINANCIAL SECRETS OF MOST TRADERS IN THE TOWN AND COULDTOUCH THE SPRINGS OF THEIR CREDIT IT WAS FORTIFIED BY A BENEFICENCETHAT WAS AT ONCE READY AND SEVEREREADY TO CONFER OBLIGATIONS ANDSEVERE IN WATCHING THE RESULT. HE HAD GATHERED AS AN INDUSTRIOUS MANALWAYS AT HIS POST A CHIEF SHARE IN ADMINISTERING THE TOWN CHARITIESAND HIS PRIVATE CHARITIES WERE BOTH MINUTE AND ABUNDANT. HE WOULD TAKEA GREAT DEAL OF PAINS ABOUT APPRENTICING TEGG THE SHOEMAKERS SON ANDHE WOULD WATCH OVER TEGGS CHURCHGOING HE WOULD DEFEND MRS. STRYPETHE WASHERWOMAN AGAINST STUBBSS UNJUST EXACTION ON THE SCORE OF HERDRYINGGROUND AND HE WOULD HIMSELF SCRUTINIZE A CALUMNY AGAINST MRS.STRYPE. HIS PRIVATE MINOR LOANS WERE NUMEROUS BUT HE WOULD INQUIRESTRICTLY INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCES BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER. IN THIS WAY AMAN GATHERS A DOMAIN IN HIS NEIGHBORS HOPE AND FEAR AS WELL ASGRATITUDE AND POWER WHEN ONCE IT HAS GOT INTO THAT SUBTLE REGIONPROPAGATES ITSELF SPREADING OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO ITS EXTERNALMEANS. IT WAS A PRINCIPLE WITH MR. BULSTRODE TO GAIN AS MUCH POWER ASPOSSIBLE THAT HE MIGHT USE IT FOR THE GLORY OF GOD. HE WENT THROUGH AGREAT DEAL OF SPIRITUAL CONFLICT AND INWARD ARGUMENT IN ORDER TO ADJUSTHIS MOTIVES AND MAKE CLEAR TO HIMSELF WHAT GODS GLORY REQUIRED. BUTAS WE HAVE SEEN HIS MOTIVES WERE NOT ALWAYS RIGHTLY APPRECIATED. THEREWERE MANY CRASS MINDS IN MIDDLEMARCH WHOSE REFLECTIVE SCALES COULD ONLYWEIGH THINGS IN THE LUMP AND THEY HAD A STRONG SUSPICION THAT SINCEMR. BULSTRODE COULD NOT ENJOY LIFE IN THEIR FASHION EATING ANDDRINKING SO LITTLE AS HE DID AND WORRETING HIMSELF ABOUT EVERYTHINGHE MUST HAVE A SORT OF VAMPIRES FEAST IN THE SENSE OF MASTERY.THE SUBJECT OF THE CHAPLAINCY CAME UP AT MR. VINCYS TABLE WHEN LYDGATEWAS DINING THERE AND THE FAMILY CONNECTION WITH MR. BULSTRODE DID NOTHE OBSERVED PREVENT SOME FREEDOM OF REMARK EVEN ON THE PART OF THEHOST HIMSELF THOUGH HIS REASONS AGAINST THE PROPOSED ARRANGEMENTTURNED ENTIRELY ON HIS OBJECTION TO MR. TYKES SERMONS WHICH WERE ALLDOCTRINE AND HIS PREFERENCE FOR MR. FAREBROTHER WHOSE SERMONS WEREFREE FROM THAT TAINT. MR. VINCY LIKED WELL ENOUGH THE NOTION OF THECHAPLAINS HAVING A SALARY SUPPOSING IT WERE GIVEN TO FAREBROTHER WHOWAS AS GOOD A LITTLE FELLOW AS EVER BREATHED AND THE BEST PREACHERANYWHERE AND COMPANIONABLE TOO.WHAT LINE SHALL YOU TAKE THEN SAID MR. CHICHELY THE CORONER AGREAT COURSING COMRADE OF MR. VINCYS.OH IM PRECIOUS GLAD IM NOT ONE OF THE DIRECTORS NOW. I SHALL VOTEFOR REFERRING THE MATTER TO THE DIRECTORS AND THE MEDICAL BOARDTOGETHER. I SHALL ROLL SOME OF MY RESPONSIBILITY ON YOUR SHOULDERSDOCTOR SAID MR. VINCY GLANCING FIRST AT DR. SPRAGUE THE SENIORPHYSICIAN OF THE TOWN AND THEN AT LYDGATE WHO SAT OPPOSITE. YOUMEDICAL GENTLEMEN MUST CONSULT WHICH SORT OF BLACK DRAUGHT YOU WILLPRESCRIBE EH MR. LYDGATEI KNOW LITTLE OF EITHER SAID LYDGATE BUT IN GENERAL APPOINTMENTSARE APT TO BE MADE TOO MUCH A QUESTION OF PERSONAL LIKING. THE FITTESTMAN FOR A PARTICULAR POST IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST FELLOW OR THE MOSTAGREEABLE. SOMETIMES IF YOU WANTED TO GET A REFORM YOUR ONLY WAYWOULD BE TO PENSION OFF THE GOOD FELLOWS WHOM EVERYBODY IS FOND OF ANDPUT THEM OUT OF THE QUESTION.DR. SPRAGUE WHO WAS CONSIDERED THE PHYSICIAN OF MOST WEIGHT THOUGHDR. MINCHIN WAS USUALLY SAID TO HAVE MORE PENETRATION DIVESTED HISLARGE HEAVY FACE OF ALL EXPRESSION AND LOOKED AT HIS WINEGLASS WHILELYDGATE WAS SPEAKING. WHATEVER WAS NOT PROBLEMATICAL AND SUSPECTEDABOUT THIS YOUNG MANFOR EXAMPLE A CERTAIN SHOWINESS AS TO FOREIGNIDEAS AND A DISPOSITION TO UNSETTLE WHAT HAD BEEN SETTLED ANDFORGOTTEN BY HIS ELDERSWAS POSITIVELY UNWELCOME TO A PHYSICIAN WHOSESTANDING HAD BEEN FIXED THIRTY YEARS BEFORE BY A TREATISE ONMENINGITIS OF WHICH AT LEAST ONE COPY MARKED OWN WAS BOUND IN CALF.FOR MY PART I HAVE SOME FELLOWFEELING WITH DR. SPRAGUE ONESSELFSATISFACTION IS AN UNTAXED KIND OF PROPERTY WHICH IT IS VERYUNPLEASANT TO FIND DEPRECATED.LYDGATES REMARK HOWEVER DID NOT MEET THE SENSE OF THE COMPANY. MR.VINCY SAID THAT IF HE COULD HAVE HIS WAY HE WOULD NOT PUTDISAGREEABLE FELLOWS ANYWHERE.HANG YOUR REFORMS SAID MR. CHICHELY. THERES NO GREATER HUMBUG INTHE WORLD. YOU NEVER HEAR OF A REFORM BUT IT MEANS SOME TRICK TO PUTIN NEW MEN. I HOPE YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THE LANCETS MEN MR.LYDGATEWANTING TO TAKE THE CORONERSHIP OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE LEGALPROFESSION YOUR WORDS APPEAR TO POINT THAT WAY.I DISAPPROVE OF WAKLEY INTERPOSED DR. SPRAGUE NO MAN MORE HE ISAN ILLINTENTIONED FELLOW WHO WOULD SACRIFICE THE RESPECTABILITY OFTHE PROFESSION WHICH EVERYBODY KNOWS DEPENDS ON THE LONDON COLLEGESFOR THE SAKE OF GETTING SOME NOTORIETY FOR HIMSELF. THERE ARE MEN WHODONT MIND ABOUT BEING KICKED BLUE IF THEY CAN ONLY GET TALKED ABOUT.BUT WAKLEY IS RIGHT SOMETIMES THE DOCTOR ADDED JUDICIALLY. I COULDMENTION ONE OR TWO POINTS IN WHICH WAKLEY IS IN THE RIGHT.OH WELL SAID MR. CHICHELY I BLAME NO MAN FOR STANDING UP IN FAVOROF HIS OWN CLOTH BUT COMING TO ARGUMENT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW ACORONER IS TO JUDGE OF EVIDENCE IF HE HAS NOT HAD A LEGAL TRAININGIN MY OPINION SAID LYDGATE LEGAL TRAINING ONLY MAKES A MAN MOREINCOMPETENT IN QUESTIONS THAT REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE OF ANOTHER KIND. PEOPLETALK ABOUT EVIDENCE AS IF IT COULD REALLY BE WEIGHED IN SCALES BY ABLIND JUSTICE. NO MAN CAN JUDGE WHAT IS GOOD EVIDENCE ON ANY PARTICULARSUBJECT UNLESS HE KNOWS THAT SUBJECT WELL. A LAWYER IS NO BETTER THANAN OLD WOMAN AT A POSTMORTEM EXAMINATION. HOW IS HE TO KNOW THE ACTIONOF A POISON YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT SCANNING VERSE WILL TEACH YOUTO SCAN THE POTATO CROPS.YOU ARE AWARE I SUPPOSE THAT IT IS NOT THE CORONERS BUSINESS TOCONDUCT THE POSTMORTEM BUT ONLY TO TAKE THE EVIDENCE OF THE MEDICALWITNESS SAID MR. CHICHELY WITH SOME SCORN.WHO IS OFTEN ALMOST AS IGNORANT AS THE CORONER HIMSELF SAID LYDGATE.QUESTIONS OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE OUGHT NOT TO BE LEFT TO THE CHANCEOF DECENT KNOWLEDGE IN A MEDICAL WITNESS AND THE CORONER OUGHT NOT TOBE A MAN WHO WILL BELIEVE THAT STRYCHNINE WILL DESTROY THE COATS OF THESTOMACH IF AN IGNORANT PRACTITIONER HAPPENS TO TELL HIM SO.LYDGATE HAD REALLY LOST SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT MR. CHICHELY WAS HISMAJESTYS CORONER AND ENDED INNOCENTLY WITH THE QUESTION DONT YOUAGREE WITH ME DR. SPRAGUETO A CERTAIN EXTENTWITH REGARD TO POPULOUS DISTRICTS AND IN THEMETROPOLIS SAID THE DOCTOR. BUT I HOPE IT WILL BE LONG BEFORE THISPART OF THE COUNTRY LOSES THE SERVICES OF MY FRIEND CHICHELY EVENTHOUGH IT MIGHT GET THE BEST MAN IN OUR PROFESSION TO SUCCEED HIM. I AMSURE VINCY WILL AGREE WITH ME.YES YES GIVE ME A CORONER WHO IS A GOOD COURSING MAN SAID MR.VINCY JOVIALLY. AND IN MY OPINION YOURE SAFEST WITH A LAWYER.NOBODY CAN KNOW EVERYTHING. MOST THINGS ARE VISITATION OF GOD. AND ASTO POISONING WHY WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW IS THE LAW. COME SHALL WEJOIN THE LADIESLYDGATES PRIVATE OPINION WAS THAT MR. CHICHELY MIGHT BE THE VERYCORONER WITHOUT BIAS AS TO THE COATS OF THE STOMACH BUT HE HAD NOTMEANT TO BE PERSONAL. THIS WAS ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF MOVING INGOOD MIDDLEMARCH SOCIETY IT WAS DANGEROUS TO INSIST ON KNOWLEDGE AS AQUALIFICATION FOR ANY SALARIED OFFICE. FRED VINCY HAD CALLED LYDGATE APRIG AND NOW MR. CHICHELY WAS INCLINED TO CALL HIM PRICKEAREDESPECIALLY WHEN IN THE DRAWINGROOM HE SEEMED TO BE MAKING HIMSELFEMINENTLY AGREEABLE TO ROSAMOND WHOM HE HAD EASILY MONOPOLIZED IN ATTETTE SINCE MRS. VINCY HERSELF SAT AT THE TEATABLE. SHERESIGNED NO DOMESTIC FUNCTION TO HER DAUGHTER AND THE MATRONSBLOOMING GOODNATURED FACE WITH THE TWO VOLATILE PINK STRINGS FLOATINGFROM HER FINE THROAT AND HER CHEERY MANNERS TO HUSBAND AND CHILDRENWAS CERTAINLY AMONG THE GREAT ATTRACTIONS OF THE VINCYHOUSEATTRACTIONS WHICH MADE IT ALL THE EASIER TO FALL IN LOVE WITH THEDAUGHTER. THE TINGE OF UNPRETENTIOUS INOFFENSIVE VULGARITY IN MRS.VINCY GAVE MORE EFFECT TO ROSAMONDS REFINEMENT WHICH WAS BEYOND WHATLYDGATE HAD EXPECTED.CERTAINLY SMALL FEET AND PERFECTLY TURNED SHOULDERS AID THE IMPRESSIONOF REFINED MANNERS AND THE RIGHT THING SAID SEEMS QUITE ASTONISHINGLYRIGHT WHEN IT IS ACCOMPANIED WITH EXQUISITE CURVES OF LIP AND EYELID.AND ROSAMOND COULD SAY THE RIGHT THING FOR SHE WAS CLEVER WITH THATSORT OF CLEVERNESS WHICH CATCHES EVERY TONE EXCEPT THE HUMOROUS.HAPPILY SHE NEVER ATTEMPTED TO JOKE AND THIS PERHAPS WAS THE MOSTDECISIVE MARK OF HER CLEVERNESS.SHE AND LYDGATE READILY GOT INTO CONVERSATION. HE REGRETTED THAT HE HADNOT HEARD HER SING THE OTHER DAY AT STONE COURT. THE ONLY PLEASURE HEALLOWED HIMSELF DURING THE LATTER PART OF HIS STAY IN PARIS WAS TO GOAND HEAR MUSIC.YOU HAVE STUDIED MUSIC PROBABLY SAID ROSAMOND.NO I KNOW THE NOTES OF MANY BIRDS AND I KNOW MANY MELODIES BY EARBUT THE MUSIC THAT I DONT KNOW AT ALL AND HAVE NO NOTION ABOUTDELIGHTS MEAFFECTS ME. HOW STUPID THE WORLD IS THAT IT DOES NOT MAKEMORE USE OF SUCH A PLEASURE WITHIN ITS REACHYES AND YOU WILL FIND MIDDLEMARCH VERY TUNELESS. THERE ARE HARDLY ANYGOOD MUSICIANS. I ONLY KNOW TWO GENTLEMEN WHO SING AT ALL WELL.I SUPPOSE IT IS THE FASHION TO SING COMIC SONGS IN A RHYTHMIC WAYLEAVING YOU TO FANCY THE TUNEVERY MUCH AS IF IT WERE TAPPED ON ADRUMAH YOU HAVE HEARD MR. BOWYER SAID ROSAMOND WITH ONE OF HER RARESMILES. BUT WE ARE SPEAKING VERY ILL OF OUR NEIGHBORS.LYDGATE WAS ALMOST FORGETTING THAT HE MUST CARRY ON THE CONVERSATIONIN THINKING HOW LOVELY THIS CREATURE WAS HER GARMENT SEEMING TO BEMADE OUT OF THE FAINTEST BLUE SKY HERSELF SO IMMACULATELY BLOND AS IFTHE PETALS OF SOME GIGANTIC FLOWER HAD JUST OPENED AND DISCLOSED HERAND YET WITH THIS INFANTINE BLONDNESS SHOWING SO MUCH READYSELFPOSSESSED GRACE. SINCE HE HAD HAD THE MEMORY OF LAURE LYDGATE HADLOST ALL TASTE FOR LARGEEYED SILENCE THE DIVINE COW NO LONGERATTRACTED HIM AND ROSAMOND WAS HER VERY OPPOSITE. BUT HE RECALLEDHIMSELF.YOU WILL LET ME HEAR SOME MUSIC TONIGHT I HOPE.I WILL LET YOU HEAR MY ATTEMPTS IF YOU LIKE SAID ROSAMOND. PAPA ISSURE TO INSIST ON MY SINGING. BUT I SHALL TREMBLE BEFORE YOU WHO HAVEHEARD THE BEST SINGERS IN PARIS. I HAVE HEARD VERY LITTLE I HAVE ONLYONCE BEEN TO LONDON. BUT OUR ORGANIST AT ST. PETERS IS A GOODMUSICIAN AND I GO ON STUDYING WITH HIM.TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW IN LONDON.VERY LITTLE. A MORE NAIVE GIRL WOULD HAVE SAID OH EVERYTHINGBUT ROSAMOND KNEW BETTER. A FEW OF THE ORDINARY SIGHTS SUCH AS RAWCOUNTRY GIRLS ARE ALWAYS TAKEN TO.DO YOU CALL YOURSELF A RAW COUNTRY GIRL SAID LYDGATE LOOKING AT HERWITH AN INVOLUNTARY EMPHASIS OF ADMIRATION WHICH MADE ROSAMOND BLUSHWITH PLEASURE. BUT SHE REMAINED SIMPLY SERIOUS TURNED HER LONG NECK ALITTLE AND PUT UP HER HAND TO TOUCH HER WONDROUS HAIRPLAITSANHABITUAL GESTURE WITH HER AS PRETTY AS ANY MOVEMENTS OF A KITTENS PAW.NOT THAT ROSAMOND WAS IN THE LEAST LIKE A KITTEN SHE WAS A SYLPHCAUGHT YOUNG AND EDUCATED AT MRS. LEMONS.I ASSURE YOU MY MIND IS RAW SHE SAID IMMEDIATELY I PASS ATMIDDLEMARCH. I AM NOT AFRAID OF TALKING TO OUR OLD NEIGHBORS. BUT I AMREALLY AFRAID OF YOU.AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN ALMOST ALWAYS KNOWS MORE THAN WE MEN THOUGH HERKNOWLEDGE IS OF A DIFFERENT SORT. I AM SURE YOU COULD TEACH ME ATHOUSAND THINGSAS AN EXQUISITE BIRD COULD TEACH A BEAR IF THERE WEREANY COMMON LANGUAGE BETWEEN THEM. HAPPILY THERE IS A COMMON LANGUAGEBETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN AND SO THE BEARS CAN GET TAUGHT.AH THERE IS FRED BEGINNING TO STRUM I MUST GO AND HINDER HIM FROMJARRING ALL YOUR NERVES SAID ROSAMOND MOVING TO THE OTHER SIDE OFTHE ROOM WHERE FRED HAVING OPENED THE PIANO AT HIS FATHERS DESIRETHAT ROSAMOND MIGHT GIVE THEM SOME MUSIC WAS PARENTHETICALLYPERFORMING CHERRY RIPE WITH ONE HAND. ABLE MEN WHO HAVE PASSED THEIREXAMINATIONS WILL DO THESE THINGS SOMETIMES NOT LESS THAN THE PLUCKEDFRED.FRED PRAY DEFER YOUR PRACTISING TILL TOMORROW YOU WILL MAKE MR.LYDGATE ILL SAID ROSAMOND. HE HAS AN EAR.FRED LAUGHED AND WENT ON WITH HIS TUNE TO THE END.ROSAMOND TURNED TO LYDGATE SMILING GENTLY AND SAID YOU PERCEIVETHE BEARS WILL NOT ALWAYS BE TAUGHT.NOW THEN ROSY SAID FRED SPRINGING FROM THE STOOL AND TWISTING ITUPWARD FOR HER WITH A HEARTY EXPECTATION OF ENJOYMENT. SOME GOODROUSING TUNES FIRST.ROSAMOND PLAYED ADMIRABLY. HER MASTER AT MRS. LEMONS SCHOOL CLOSE TOA COUNTY TOWN WITH A MEMORABLE HISTORY THAT HAD ITS RELICS IN CHURCHAND CASTLE WAS ONE OF THOSE EXCELLENT MUSICIANS HERE AND THERE TO BEFOUND IN OUR PROVINCES WORTHY TO COMPARE WITH MANY A NOTEDKAPELLMEISTER IN A COUNTRY WHICH OFFERS MORE PLENTIFUL CONDITIONS OFMUSICAL CELEBRITY. ROSAMOND WITH THE EXECUTANTS INSTINCT HAD SEIZEDHIS MANNER OF PLAYING AND GAVE FORTH HIS LARGE RENDERING OF NOBLEMUSIC WITH THE PRECISION OF AN ECHO. IT WAS ALMOST STARTLING HEARD FORTHE FIRST TIME. A HIDDEN SOUL SEEMED TO BE FLOWING FORTH FROMROSAMONDS FINGERS AND SO INDEED IT WAS SINCE SOULS LIVE ON INPERPETUAL ECHOES AND TO ALL FINE EXPRESSION THERE GOES SOMEWHERE ANORIGINATING ACTIVITY IF IT BE ONLY THAT OF AN INTERPRETER. LYDGATE WASTAKEN POSSESSION OF AND BEGAN TO BELIEVE IN HER AS SOMETHINGEXCEPTIONAL. AFTER ALL HE THOUGHT ONE NEED NOT BE SURPRISED TO FINDTHE RARE CONJUNCTIONS OF NATURE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES APPARENTLYUNFAVORABLE COME WHERE THEY MAY THEY ALWAYS DEPEND ON CONDITIONS THATARE NOT OBVIOUS. HE SAT LOOKING AT HER AND DID NOT RISE TO PAY HER ANYCOMPLIMENTS LEAVING THAT TO OTHERS NOW THAT HIS ADMIRATION WASDEEPENED.HER SINGING WAS LESS REMARKABLE BUT ALSO WELL TRAINED AND SWEET TOHEAR AS A CHIME PERFECTLY IN TUNE. IT IS TRUE SHE SANG MEET ME BYMOONLIGHT AND IVE BEEN ROAMING FOR MORTALS MUST SHARE THEFASHIONS OF THEIR TIME AND NONE BUT THE ANCIENTS CAN BE ALWAYSCLASSICAL. BUT ROSAMOND COULD ALSO SING BLACKEYED SUSAN WITH EFFECTOR HAYDNS CANZONETS OR VOI CHE SAPETE OR BATTI BATTISHE ONLYWANTED TO KNOW WHAT HER AUDIENCE LIKED.HER FATHER LOOKED ROUND AT THE COMPANY DELIGHTING IN THEIR ADMIRATION.HER MOTHER SAT LIKE A NIOBE BEFORE HER TROUBLES WITH HER YOUNGESTLITTLE GIRL ON HER LAP SOFTLY BEATING THE CHILDS HAND UP AND DOWN INTIME TO THE MUSIC. AND FRED NOTWITHSTANDING HIS GENERAL SCEPTICISMABOUT ROSY LISTENED TO HER MUSIC WITH PERFECT ALLEGIANCE WISHING HECOULD DO THE SAME THING ON HIS FLUTE. IT WAS THE PLEASANTEST FAMILYPARTY THAT LYDGATE HAD SEEN SINCE HE CAME TO MIDDLEMARCH. THE VINCYSHAD THE READINESS TO ENJOY THE REJECTION OF ALL ANXIETY AND THEBELIEF IN LIFE AS A MERRY LOT WHICH MADE A HOUSE EXCEPTIONAL IN MOSTCOUNTY TOWNS AT THAT TIME WHEN EVANGELICALISM HAD CAST A CERTAINSUSPICION AS OF PLAGUEINFECTION OVER THE FEW AMUSEMENTS WHICH SURVIVEDIN THE PROVINCES. AT THE VINCYS THERE WAS ALWAYS WHIST AND THECARDTABLES STOOD READY NOW MAKING SOME OF THE COMPANY SECRETLYIMPATIENT OF THE MUSIC. BEFORE IT CEASED MR. FAREBROTHER CAME INAHANDSOME BROADCHESTED BUT OTHERWISE SMALL MAN ABOUT FORTY WHOSEBLACK WAS VERY THREADBARE THE BRILLIANCY WAS ALL IN HIS QUICK GRAYEYES. HE CAME LIKE A PLEASANT CHANGE IN THE LIGHT ARRESTING LITTLELOUISA WITH FATHERLY NONSENSE AS SHE WAS BEING LED OUT OF THE ROOM BYMISS MORGAN GREETING EVERYBODY WITH SOME SPECIAL WORD AND SEEMING TOCONDENSE MORE TALK INTO TEN MINUTES THAN HAD BEEN HELD ALL THROUGH THEEVENING. HE CLAIMED FROM LYDGATE THE FULFILMENT OF A PROMISE TO COMEAND SEE HIM. I CANT LET YOU OFF YOU KNOW BECAUSE I HAVE SOMEBEETLES TO SHOW YOU. WE COLLECTORS FEEL AN INTEREST IN EVERY NEW MANTILL HE HAS SEEN ALL WE HAVE TO SHOW HIM.BUT SOON HE SWERVED TO THE WHISTTABLE RUBBING HIS HANDS AND SAYINGCOME NOW LET US BE SERIOUS MR. LYDGATE NOT PLAY AH YOU ARE TOOYOUNG AND LIGHT FOR THIS KIND OF THING.LYDGATE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THE CLERGYMAN WHOSE ABILITIES WERE SOPAINFUL TO MR. BULSTRODE APPEARED TO HAVE FOUND AN AGREEABLE RESORT INTHIS CERTAINLY NOT ERUDITE HOUSEHOLD. HE COULD HALF UNDERSTAND IT THEGOODHUMOR THE GOOD LOOKS OF ELDER AND YOUNGER AND THE PROVISION FORPASSING THE TIME WITHOUT ANY LABOR OF INTELLIGENCE MIGHT MAKE THEHOUSE BEGUILING TO PEOPLE WHO HAD NO PARTICULAR USE FOR THEIR ODDHOURS.EVERYTHING LOOKED BLOOMING AND JOYOUS EXCEPT MISS MORGAN WHO WASBROWN DULL AND RESIGNED AND ALTOGETHER AS MRS. VINCY OFTEN SAIDJUST THE SORT OF PERSON FOR A GOVERNESS. LYDGATE DID NOT MEAN TO PAYMANY SUCH VISITS HIMSELF. THEY WERE A WRETCHED WASTE OF THE EVENINGSAND NOW WHEN HE HAD TALKED A LITTLE MORE TO ROSAMOND HE MEANT TOEXCUSE HIMSELF AND GO.YOU WILL NOT LIKE US AT MIDDLEMARCH I FEEL SURE SHE SAID WHEN THEWHISTPLAYERS WERE SETTLED. WE ARE VERY STUPID AND YOU HAVE BEEN USEDTO SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT.I SUPPOSE ALL COUNTRY TOWNS ARE PRETTY MUCH ALIKE SAID LYDGATE. BUTI HAVE NOTICED THAT ONE ALWAYS BELIEVES ONES OWN TOWN TO BE MORESTUPID THAN ANY OTHER. I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO TAKE MIDDLEMARCH AS ITCOMES AND SHALL BE MUCH OBLIGED IF THE TOWN WILL TAKE ME IN THE SAMEWAY. I HAVE CERTAINLY FOUND SOME CHARMS IN IT WHICH ARE MUCH GREATERTHAN I HAD EXPECTED.YOU MEAN THE RIDES TOWARDS TIPTON AND LOWICK EVERY ONE IS PLEASEDWITH THOSE SAID ROSAMOND WITH SIMPLICITY.NO I MEAN SOMETHING MUCH NEARER TO ME.ROSAMOND ROSE AND REACHED HER NETTING AND THEN SAID DO YOU CAREABOUT DANCING AT ALL I AM NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER CLEVER MEN EVERDANCE.I WOULD DANCE WITH YOU IF YOU WOULD ALLOW ME.OH SAID ROSAMOND WITH A SLIGHT DEPRECATORY LAUGH. I WAS ONLY GOINGTO SAY THAT WE SOMETIMES HAVE DANCING AND I WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER YOUWOULD FEEL INSULTED IF YOU WERE ASKED TO COME.NOT ON THE CONDITION I MENTIONED.AFTER THIS CHAT LYDGATE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS GOING BUT ON MOVINGTOWARDS THE WHISTTABLES HE GOT INTERESTED IN WATCHING MR.FAREBROTHERS PLAY WHICH WAS MASTERLY AND ALSO HIS FACE WHICH WAS ASTRIKING MIXTURE OF THE SHREWD AND THE MILD. AT TEN OCLOCK SUPPER WASBROUGHT IN SUCH WERE THE CUSTOMS OF MIDDLEMARCH AND THERE WASPUNCHDRINKING BUT MR. FAREBROTHER HAD ONLY A GLASS OF WATER. HE WASWINNING BUT THERE SEEMED TO BE NO REASON WHY THE RENEWAL OF RUBBERSSHOULD END AND LYDGATE AT LAST TOOK HIS LEAVE.BUT AS IT WAS NOT ELEVEN OCLOCK HE CHOSE TO WALK IN THE BRISK AIRTOWARDS THE TOWER OF ST. BOTOLPHS MR. FAREBROTHERS CHURCH WHICHSTOOD OUT DARK SQUARE AND MASSIVE AGAINST THE STARLIGHT. IT WAS THEOLDEST CHURCH IN MIDDLEMARCH THE LIVING HOWEVER WAS BUT A VICARAGEWORTH BARELY FOUR HUNDRED AYEAR. LYDGATE HAD HEARD THAT AND HEWONDERED NOW WHETHER MR. FAREBROTHER CARED ABOUT THE MONEY HE WON ATCARDS THINKING HE SEEMS A VERY PLEASANT FELLOW BUT BULSTRODE MAYHAVE HIS GOOD REASONS. MANY THINGS WOULD BE EASIER TO LYDGATE IF ITSHOULD TURN OUT THAT MR. BULSTRODE WAS GENERALLY JUSTIFIABLE. WHAT ISHIS RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE TO ME IF HE CARRIES SOME GOOD NOTIONS ALONGWITH IT ONE MUST USE SUCH BRAINS AS ARE TO BE FOUND.THESE WERE ACTUALLY LYDGATES FIRST MEDITATIONS AS HE WALKED AWAY FROMMR. VINCYS AND ON THIS GROUND I FEAR THAT MANY LADIES WILL CONSIDERHIM HARDLY WORTHY OF THEIR ATTENTION. HE THOUGHT OF ROSAMOND AND HERMUSIC ONLY IN THE SECOND PLACE AND THOUGH WHEN HER TURN CAME HEDWELT ON THE IMAGE OF HER FOR THE REST OF HIS WALK HE FELT NOAGITATION AND HAD NO SENSE THAT ANY NEW CURRENT HAD SET INTO HIS LIFE.HE COULD NOT MARRY YET HE WISHED NOT TO MARRY FOR SEVERAL YEARS ANDTHEREFORE HE WAS NOT READY TO ENTERTAIN THE NOTION OF BEING IN LOVEWITH A GIRL WHOM HE HAPPENED TO ADMIRE. HE DID ADMIRE ROSAMONDEXCEEDINGLY BUT THAT MADNESS WHICH HAD ONCE BESET HIM ABOUT LAURE WASNOT HE THOUGHT LIKELY TO RECUR IN RELATION TO ANY OTHER WOMAN.CERTAINLY IF FALLING IN LOVE HAD BEEN AT ALL IN QUESTION IT WOULDHAVE BEEN QUITE SAFE WITH A CREATURE LIKE THIS MISS VINCY WHO HAD JUSTTHE KIND OF INTELLIGENCE ONE WOULD DESIRE IN A WOMANPOLISHED REFINEDDOCILE LENDING ITSELF TO FINISH IN ALL THE DELICACIES OF LIFE ANDENSHRINED IN A BODY WHICH EXPRESSED THIS WITH A FORCE OF DEMONSTRATIONTHAT EXCLUDED THE NEED FOR OTHER EVIDENCE. LYDGATE FELT SURE THAT IFEVER HE MARRIED HIS WIFE WOULD HAVE THAT FEMININE RADIANCE THATDISTINCTIVE WOMANHOOD WHICH MUST BE CLASSED WITH FLOWERS AND MUSICTHAT SORT OF BEAUTY WHICH BY ITS VERY NATURE WAS VIRTUOUS BEINGMOULDED ONLY FOR PURE AND DELICATE JOYS.BUT SINCE HE DID NOT MEAN TO MARRY FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARSHIS MOREPRESSING BUSINESS WAS TO LOOK INTO LOUIS NEW BOOK ON FEVER WHICH HEWAS SPECIALLY INTERESTED IN BECAUSE HE HAD KNOWN LOUIS IN PARIS ANDHAD FOLLOWED MANY ANATOMICAL DEMONSTRATIONS IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THESPECIFIC DIFFERENCES OF TYPHUS AND TYPHOID. HE WENT HOME AND READ FARINTO THE SMALLEST HOUR BRINGING A MUCH MORE TESTING VISION OF DETAILSAND RELATIONS INTO THIS PATHOLOGICAL STUDY THAN HE HAD EVER THOUGHT ITNECESSARY TO APPLY TO THE COMPLEXITIES OF LOVE AND MARRIAGE THESEBEING SUBJECTS ON WHICH HE FELT HIMSELF AMPLY INFORMED BY LITERATUREAND THAT TRADITIONAL WISDOM WHICH IS HANDED DOWN IN THE GENIALCONVERSATION OF MEN. WHEREAS FEVER HAD OBSCURE CONDITIONS AND GAVE HIMTHAT DELIGHTFUL LABOR OF THE IMAGINATION WHICH IS NOT MEREARBITRARINESS BUT THE EXERCISE OF DISCIPLINED POWERCOMBINING ANDCONSTRUCTING WITH THE CLEAREST EYE FOR PROBABILITIES AND THE FULLESTOBEDIENCE TO KNOWLEDGE AND THEN IN YET MORE ENERGETIC ALLIANCE WITHIMPARTIAL NATURE STANDING ALOOF TO INVENT TESTS BY WHICH TO TRY ITSOWN WORK.MANY MEN HAVE BEEN PRAISED AS VIVIDLY IMAGINATIVE ON THE STRENGTH OFTHEIR PROFUSENESS IN INDIFFERENT DRAWING OR CHEAP NARRATIONREPORTS OFVERY POOR TALK GOING ON IN DISTANT ORBS OR PORTRAITS OF LUCIFER COMINGDOWN ON HIS BAD ERRANDS AS A LARGE UGLY MAN WITH BATS WINGS AND SPURTSOF PHOSPHORESCENCE OR EXAGGERATIONS OF WANTONNESS THAT SEEM TO REFLECTLIFE IN A DISEASED DREAM. BUT THESE KINDS OF INSPIRATION LYDGATEREGARDED AS RATHER VULGAR AND VINOUS COMPARED WITH THE IMAGINATION THATREVEALS SUBTLE ACTIONS INACCESSIBLE BY ANY SORT OF LENS BUT TRACKED INTHAT OUTER DARKNESS THROUGH LONG PATHWAYS OF NECESSARY SEQUENCE BY THEINWARD LIGHT WHICH IS THE LAST REFINEMENT OF ENERGY CAPABLE OF BATHINGEVEN THE ETHEREAL ATOMS IN ITS IDEALLY ILLUMINATED SPACE. HE FOR HISPART HAD TOSSED AWAY ALL CHEAP INVENTIONS WHERE IGNORANCE FINDS ITSELFABLE AND AT EASE HE WAS ENAMOURED OF THAT ARDUOUS INVENTION WHICH ISTHE VERY EYE OF RESEARCH PROVISIONALLY FRAMING ITS OBJECT ANDCORRECTING IT TO MORE AND MORE EXACTNESS OF RELATION HE WANTED TOPIERCE THE OBSCURITY OF THOSE MINUTE PROCESSES WHICH PREPARE HUMANMISERY AND JOY THOSE INVISIBLE THOROUGHFARES WHICH ARE THE FIRSTLURKINGPLACES OF ANGUISH MANIA AND CRIME THAT DELICATE POISE ANDTRANSITION WHICH DETERMINE THE GROWTH OF HAPPY OR UNHAPPYCONSCIOUSNESS.AS HE THREW DOWN HIS BOOK STRETCHED HIS LEGS TOWARDS THE EMBERS IN THEGRATE AND CLASPED HIS HANDS AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD IN THAT AGREEABLEAFTERGLOW OF EXCITEMENT WHEN THOUGHT LAPSES FROM EXAMINATION OF ASPECIFIC OBJECT INTO A SUFFUSIVE SENSE OF ITS CONNECTIONS WITH ALL THEREST OF OUR EXISTENCESEEMS AS IT WERE TO THROW ITSELF ON ITS BACKAFTER VIGOROUS SWIMMING AND FLOAT WITH THE REPOSE OF UNEXHAUSTEDSTRENGTHLYDGATE FELT A TRIUMPHANT DELIGHT IN HIS STUDIES ANDSOMETHING LIKE PITY FOR THOSE LESS LUCKY MEN WHO WERE NOT OF HISPROFESSION.IF I HAD NOT TAKEN THAT TURN WHEN I WAS A LAD HE THOUGHT I MIGHTHAVE GOT INTO SOME STUPID DRAUGHTHORSE WORK OR OTHER AND LIVED ALWAYSIN BLINKERS. I SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN HAPPY IN ANY PROFESSION THAT DIDNOT CALL FORTH THE HIGHEST INTELLECTUAL STRAIN AND YET KEEP ME IN GOODWARM CONTACT WITH MY NEIGHBORS. THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THE MEDICALPROFESSION FOR THAT ONE CAN HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE SCIENTIFIC LIFE THATTOUCHES THE DISTANCE AND BEFRIEND THE OLD FOGIES IN THE PARISH TOO. ITIS RATHER HARDER FOR A CLERGYMAN FAREBROTHER SEEMS TO BE AN ANOMALY.THIS LAST THOUGHT BROUGHT BACK THE VINCYS AND ALL THE PICTURES OF THEEVENING. THEY FLOATED IN HIS MIND AGREEABLY ENOUGH AND AS HE TOOK UPHIS BEDCANDLE HIS LIPS WERE CURLED WITH THAT INCIPIENT SMILE WHICH ISAPT TO ACCOMPANY AGREEABLE RECOLLECTIONS. HE WAS AN ARDENT FELLOW BUTAT PRESENT HIS ARDOR WAS ABSORBED IN LOVE OF HIS WORK AND IN THEAMBITION OF MAKING HIS LIFE RECOGNIZED AS A FACTOR IN THE BETTER LIFEOF MANKINDLIKE OTHER HEROES OF SCIENCE WHO HAD NOTHING BUT AN OBSCURECOUNTRY PRACTICE TO BEGIN WITH.POOR LYDGATE OR SHALL I SAY POOR ROSAMOND EACH LIVED IN A WORLD OFWHICH THE OTHER KNEW NOTHING. IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO LYDGATE THAT HEHAD BEEN A SUBJECT OF EAGER MEDITATION TO ROSAMOND WHO HAD NEITHER ANYREASON FOR THROWING HER MARRIAGE INTO DISTANT PERSPECTIVE NOR ANYPATHOLOGICAL STUDIES TO DIVERT HER MIND FROM THAT RUMINATING HABITTHAT INWARD REPETITION OF LOOKS WORDS AND PHRASES WHICH MAKES ALARGE PART IN THE LIVES OF MOST GIRLS. HE HAD NOT MEANT TO LOOK AT HEROR SPEAK TO HER WITH MORE THAN THE INEVITABLE AMOUNT OF ADMIRATION ANDCOMPLIMENT WHICH A MAN MUST GIVE TO A BEAUTIFUL GIRL INDEED IT SEEMEDTO HIM THAT HIS ENJOYMENT OF HER MUSIC HAD REMAINED ALMOST SILENT FORHE FEARED FALLING INTO THE RUDENESS OF TELLING HER HIS GREAT SURPRISEAT HER POSSESSION OF SUCH ACCOMPLISHMENT. BUT ROSAMOND HAD REGISTEREDEVERY LOOK AND WORD AND ESTIMATED THEM AS THE OPENING INCIDENTS OF APRECONCEIVED ROMANCEINCIDENTS WHICH GATHER VALUE FROM THE FORESEENDEVELOPMENT AND CLIMAX. IN ROSAMONDS ROMANCE IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TOIMAGINE MUCH ABOUT THE INWARD LIFE OF THE HERO OR OF HIS SERIOUSBUSINESS IN THE WORLD OF COURSE HE HAD A PROFESSION AND WAS CLEVERAS WELL AS SUFFICIENTLY HANDSOME BUT THE PIQUANT FACT ABOUT LYDGATEWAS HIS GOOD BIRTH WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIM FROM ALL MIDDLEMARCHADMIRERS AND PRESENTED MARRIAGE AS A PROSPECT OF RISING IN RANK ANDGETTING A LITTLE NEARER TO THAT CELESTIAL CONDITION ON EARTH IN WHICHSHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH VULGAR PEOPLE AND PERHAPS AT LASTASSOCIATE WITH RELATIVES QUITE EQUAL TO THE COUNTY PEOPLE WHO LOOKEDDOWN ON THE MIDDLEMARCHERS. IT WAS PART OF ROSAMONDS CLEVERNESS TODISCERN VERY SUBTLY THE FAINTEST AROMA OF RANK AND ONCE WHEN SHE HADSEEN THE MISS BROOKES ACCOMPANYING THEIR UNCLE AT THE COUNTY ASSIZESAND SEATED AMONG THE ARISTOCRACY SHE HAD ENVIED THEM NOTWITHSTANDINGTHEIR PLAIN DRESS.IF YOU THINK IT INCREDIBLE THAT TO IMAGINE LYDGATE AS A MAN OF FAMILYCOULD CAUSE THRILLS OF SATISFACTION WHICH HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THESENSE THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM I WILL ASK YOU TO USE YOUR POWEROF COMPARISON A LITTLE MORE EFFECTIVELY AND CONSIDER WHETHER RED CLOTHAND EPAULETS HAVE NEVER HAD AN INFLUENCE OF THAT SORT. OUR PASSIONS DONOT LIVE APART IN LOCKED CHAMBERS BUT DRESSED IN THEIR SMALL WARDROBEOF NOTIONS BRING THEIR PROVISIONS TO A COMMON TABLE AND MESS TOGETHERFEEDING OUT OF THE COMMON STORE ACCORDING TO THEIR APPETITE.ROSAMOND IN FACT WAS ENTIRELY OCCUPIED NOT EXACTLY WITH TERTIUSLYDGATE AS HE WAS IN HIMSELF BUT WITH HIS RELATION TO HER AND IT WASEXCUSABLE IN A GIRL WHO WAS ACCUSTOMED TO HEAR THAT ALL YOUNG MENMIGHT COULD WOULD BE OR ACTUALLY WERE IN LOVE WITH HER TO BELIEVEAT ONCE THAT LYDGATE COULD BE NO EXCEPTION. HIS LOOKS AND WORDS MEANTMORE TO HER THAN OTHER MENS BECAUSE SHE CARED MORE FOR THEM SHETHOUGHT OF THEM DILIGENTLY AND DILIGENTLY ATTENDED TO THAT PERFECTIONOF APPEARANCE BEHAVIOR SENTIMENTS AND ALL OTHER ELEGANCIES WHICHWOULD FIND IN LYDGATE A MORE ADEQUATE ADMIRER THAN SHE HAD YET BEENCONSCIOUS OF.FOR ROSAMOND THOUGH SHE WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING THAT WAS DISAGREEABLETO HER WAS INDUSTRIOUS AND NOW MORE THAN EVER SHE WAS ACTIVE INSKETCHING HER LANDSCAPES AND MARKETCARTS AND PORTRAITS OF FRIENDS INPRACTISING HER MUSIC AND IN BEING FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT HER OWNSTANDARD OF A PERFECT LADY HAVING ALWAYS AN AUDIENCE IN HER OWNCONSCIOUSNESS WITH SOMETIMES THE NOT UNWELCOME ADDITION OF A MOREVARIABLE EXTERNAL AUDIENCE IN THE NUMEROUS VISITORS OF THE HOUSE. SHEFOUND TIME ALSO TO READ THE BEST NOVELS AND EVEN THE SECOND BEST ANDSHE KNEW MUCH POETRY BY HEART. HER FAVORITE POEM WAS LALLA ROOKH.THE BEST GIRL IN THE WORLD HE WILL BE A HAPPY FELLOW WHO GETS HERWAS THE SENTIMENT OF THE ELDERLY GENTLEMEN WHO VISITED THE VINCYS ANDTHE REJECTED YOUNG MEN THOUGHT OF TRYING AGAIN AS IS THE FASHION INCOUNTRY TOWNS WHERE THE HORIZON IS NOT THICK WITH COMING RIVALS. BUTMRS. PLYMDALE THOUGHT THAT ROSAMOND HAD BEEN EDUCATED TO A RIDICULOUSPITCH FOR WHAT WAS THE USE OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHICH WOULD BE ALL LAIDASIDE AS SOON AS SHE WAS MARRIED WHILE HER AUNT BULSTRODE WHO HAD ASISTERLY FAITHFULNESS TOWARDS HER BROTHERS FAMILY HAD TWO SINCEREWISHES FOR ROSAMONDTHAT SHE MIGHT SHOW A MORE SERIOUS TURN OF MINDAND THAT SHE MIGHT MEET WITH A HUSBAND WHOSE WEALTH CORRESPONDED TO HERHABITS.CHAPTER XVII.THE CLERKLY PERSON SMILED AND SAIDPROMISE WAS A PRETTY MAIDBUT BEING POOR SHE DIED UNWED.THE REV. CAMDEN FAREBROTHER WHOM LYDGATE WENT TO SEE THE NEXT EVENINGLIVED IN AN OLD PARSONAGE BUILT OF STONE VENERABLE ENOUGH TO MATCHTHE CHURCH WHICH IT LOOKED OUT UPON. ALL THE FURNITURE TOO IN THE HOUSEWAS OLD BUT WITH ANOTHER GRADE OF AGETHAT OF MR. FAREBROTHERS FATHERAND GRANDFATHER. THERE WERE PAINTED WHITE CHAIRS WITH GILDING ANDWREATHS ON THEM AND SOME LINGERING RED SILK DAMASK WITH SLITS IN IT.THERE WERE ENGRAVED PORTRAITS OF LORD CHANCELLORS AND OTHER CELEBRATEDLAWYERS OF THE LAST CENTURY AND THERE WERE OLD PIERGLASSES TO REFLECTTHEM AS WELL AS THE LITTLE SATINWOOD TABLES AND THE SOFAS RESEMBLINGA PROLONGATION OF UNEASY CHAIRS ALL STANDING IN RELIEF AGAINST THEDARK WAINSCOT. THIS WAS THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE DRAWINGROOM INTO WHICHLYDGATE WAS SHOWN AND THERE WERE THREE LADIES TO RECEIVE HIM WHO WEREALSO OLDFASHIONED AND OF A FADED BUT GENUINE RESPECTABILITY MRS.FAREBROTHER THE VICARS WHITEHAIRED MOTHER BEFRILLED AND KERCHIEFEDWITH DAINTY CLEANLINESS UPRIGHT QUICKEYED AND STILL UNDER SEVENTYMISS NOBLE HER SISTER A TINY OLD LADY OF MEEKER ASPECT WITH FRILLSAND KERCHIEF DECIDEDLY MORE WORN AND MENDED AND MISS WINIFREDFAREBROTHER THE VICARS ELDER SISTER WELLLOOKING LIKE HIMSELF BUTNIPPED AND SUBDUED AS SINGLE WOMEN ARE APT TO BE WHO SPEND THEIR LIVESIN UNINTERRUPTED SUBJECTION TO THEIR ELDERS. LYDGATE HAD NOT EXPECTEDTO SEE SO QUAINT A GROUP KNOWING SIMPLY THAT MR. FAREBROTHER WAS ABACHELOR HE HAD THOUGHT OF BEING USHERED INTO A SNUGGERY WHERE THECHIEF FURNITURE WOULD PROBABLY BE BOOKS AND COLLECTIONS OF NATURALOBJECTS. THE VICAR HIMSELF SEEMED TO WEAR RATHER A CHANGED ASPECT ASMOST MEN DO WHEN ACQUAINTANCES MADE ELSEWHERE SEE THEM FOR THE FIRSTTIME IN THEIR OWN HOMES SOME INDEED SHOWING LIKE AN ACTOR OF GENIALPARTS DISADVANTAGEOUSLY CAST FOR THE CURMUDGEON IN A NEW PIECE. THISWAS NOT THE CASE WITH MR. FAREBROTHER HE SEEMED A TRIFLE MILDER ANDMORE SILENT THE CHIEF TALKER BEING HIS MOTHER WHILE HE ONLY PUT IN AGOODHUMORED MODERATING REMARK HERE AND THERE. THE OLD LADY WASEVIDENTLY ACCUSTOMED TO TELL HER COMPANY WHAT THEY OUGHT TO THINK ANDTO REGARD NO SUBJECT AS QUITE SAFE WITHOUT HER STEERING. SHE WASAFFORDED LEISURE FOR THIS FUNCTION BY HAVING ALL HER LITTLE WANTSATTENDED TO BY MISS WINIFRED. MEANWHILE TINY MISS NOBLE CARRIED ON HERARM A SMALL BASKET INTO WHICH SHE DIVERTED A BIT OF SUGAR WHICH SHEHAD FIRST DROPPED IN HER SAUCER AS IF BY MISTAKE LOOKING ROUNDFURTIVELY AFTERWARDS AND REVERTING TO HER TEACUP WITH A SMALL INNOCENTNOISE AS OF A TINY TIMID QUADRUPED. PRAY THINK NO ILL OF MISS NOBLE.THAT BASKET HELD SMALL SAVINGS FROM HER MORE PORTABLE FOOD DESTINEDFOR THE CHILDREN OF HER POOR FRIENDS AMONG WHOM SHE TROTTED ON FINEMORNINGS FOSTERING AND PETTING ALL NEEDY CREATURES BEING SOSPONTANEOUS A DELIGHT TO HER THAT SHE REGARDED IT MUCH AS IF IT HADBEEN A PLEASANT VICE THAT SHE WAS ADDICTED TO. PERHAPS SHE WASCONSCIOUS OF BEING TEMPTED TO STEAL FROM THOSE WHO HAD MUCH THAT SHEMIGHT GIVE TO THOSE WHO HAD NOTHING AND CARRIED IN HER CONSCIENCE THEGUILT OF THAT REPRESSED DESIRE. ONE MUST BE POOR TO KNOW THE LUXURY OFGIVINGMRS. FAREBROTHER WELCOMED THE GUEST WITH A LIVELY FORMALITY ANDPRECISION. SHE PRESENTLY INFORMED HIM THAT THEY WERE NOT OFTEN IN WANTOF MEDICAL AID IN THAT HOUSE. SHE HAD BROUGHT UP HER CHILDREN TO WEARFLANNEL AND NOT TO OVEREAT THEMSELVES WHICH LAST HABIT SHE CONSIDEREDTHE CHIEF REASON WHY PEOPLE NEEDED DOCTORS. LYDGATE PLEADED FOR THOSEWHOSE FATHERS AND MOTHERS HAD OVEREATEN THEMSELVES BUT MRS.FAREBROTHER HELD THAT VIEW OF THINGS DANGEROUS NATURE WAS MORE JUSTTHAN THAT IT WOULD BE EASY FOR ANY FELON TO SAY THAT HIS ANCESTORSOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HANGED INSTEAD OF HIM. IF THOSE WHO HAD BAD FATHERSAND MOTHERS WERE BAD THEMSELVES THEY WERE HANGED FOR THAT. THERE WASNO NEED TO GO BACK ON WHAT YOU COULDNT SEE.MY MOTHER IS LIKE OLD GEORGE THE THIRD SAID THE VICAR SHE OBJECTSTO METAPHYSICS.I OBJECT TO WHAT IS WRONG CAMDEN. I SAY KEEP HOLD OF A FEW PLAINTRUTHS AND MAKE EVERYTHING SQUARE WITH THEM. WHEN I WAS YOUNG MR.LYDGATE THERE NEVER WAS ANY QUESTION ABOUT RIGHT AND WRONG. WE KNEWOUR CATECHISM AND THAT WAS ENOUGH WE LEARNED OUR CREED AND OUR DUTY.EVERY RESPECTABLE CHURCH PERSON HAD THE SAME OPINIONS. BUT NOW IF YOUSPEAK OUT OF THE PRAYERBOOK ITSELF YOU ARE LIABLE TO BECONTRADICTED.THAT MAKES RATHER A PLEASANT TIME OF IT FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO MAINTAINTHEIR OWN POINT SAID LYDGATE.BUT MY MOTHER ALWAYS GIVES WAY SAID THE VICAR SLYLY.NO NO CAMDEN YOU MUST NOT LEAD MR. LYDGATE INTO A MISTAKE ABOUTME. I SHALL NEVER SHOW THAT DISRESPECT TO MY PARENTS TO GIVE UP WHATTHEY TAUGHT ME. ANY ONE MAY SEE WHAT COMES OF TURNING. IF YOU CHANGEONCE WHY NOT TWENTY TIMESA MAN MIGHT SEE GOOD ARGUMENTS FOR CHANGING ONCE AND NOT SEE THEM FORCHANGING AGAIN SAID LYDGATE AMUSED WITH THE DECISIVE OLD LADY.EXCUSE ME THERE. IF YOU GO UPON ARGUMENTS THEY ARE NEVER WANTINGWHEN A MAN HAS NO CONSTANCY OF MIND. MY FATHER NEVER CHANGED AND HEPREACHED PLAIN MORAL SERMONS WITHOUT ARGUMENTS AND WAS A GOOD MANFEWBETTER. WHEN YOU GET ME A GOOD MAN MADE OUT OF ARGUMENTS I WILL GETYOU A GOOD DINNER WITH READING YOU THE COOKERYBOOK. THATS MY OPINIONAND I THINK ANYBODYS STOMACH WILL BEAR ME OUT.ABOUT THE DINNER CERTAINLY MOTHER SAID MR. FAREBROTHER.IT IS THE SAME THING THE DINNER OR THE MAN. I AM NEARLY SEVENTY MR.LYDGATE AND I GO UPON EXPERIENCE. I AM NOT LIKELY TO FOLLOW NEWLIGHTS THOUGH THERE ARE PLENTY OF THEM HERE AS ELSEWHERE. I SAY THEYCAME IN WITH THE MIXED STUFFS THAT WILL NEITHER WASH NOR WEAR. IT WASNOT SO IN MY YOUTH A CHURCHMAN WAS A CHURCHMAN AND A CLERGYMAN YOUMIGHT BE PRETTY SURE WAS A GENTLEMAN IF NOTHING ELSE. BUT NOW HE MAYBE NO BETTER THAN A DISSENTER AND WANT TO PUSH ASIDE MY SON ONPRETENCE OF DOCTRINE. BUT WHOEVER MAY WISH TO PUSH HIM ASIDE I AMPROUD TO SAY MR. LYDGATE THAT HE WILL COMPARE WITH ANY PREACHER INTHIS KINGDOM NOT TO SPEAK OF THIS TOWN WHICH IS BUT A LOW STANDARD TOGO BY AT LEAST TO MY THINKING FOR I WAS BORN AND BRED AT EXETER.A MOTHER IS NEVER PARTIAL SAID MR. FAREBROTHER SMILING. WHAT DOYOU THINK TYKES MOTHER SAYS ABOUT HIMAH POOR CREATURE WHAT INDEED SAID MRS. FAREBROTHER HER SHARPNESSBLUNTED FOR THE MOMENT BY HER CONFIDENCE IN MATERNAL JUDGMENTS. SHESAYS THE TRUTH TO HERSELF DEPEND UPON IT.AND WHAT IS THE TRUTH SAID LYDGATE. I AM CURIOUS TO KNOW.OH NOTHING BAD AT ALL SAID MR. FAREBROTHER. HE IS A ZEALOUSFELLOW NOT VERY LEARNED AND NOT VERY WISE I THINKBECAUSE I DONTAGREE WITH HIM.WHY CAMDEN SAID MISS WINIFRED GRIFFIN AND HIS WIFE TOLD ME ONLYTODAY THAT MR. TYKE SAID THEY SHOULD HAVE NO MORE COALS IF THEY CAMETO HEAR YOU PREACH.MRS. FAREBROTHER LAID DOWN HER KNITTING WHICH SHE HAD RESUMED AFTERHER SMALL ALLOWANCE OF TEA AND TOAST AND LOOKED AT HER SON AS IF TOSAY YOU HEAR THAT MISS NOBLE SAID OH POOR THINGS POOR THINGS INREFERENCE PROBABLY TO THE DOUBLE LOSS OF PREACHING AND COAL. BUT THEVICAR ANSWERED QUIETLYTHAT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MY PARISHIONERS. AND I DONT THINK MYSERMONS ARE WORTH A LOAD OF COALS TO THEM.MR. LYDGATE SAID MRS. FAREBROTHER WHO COULD NOT LET THIS PASS YOUDONT KNOW MY SON HE ALWAYS UNDERVALUES HIMSELF. I TELL HIM HE ISUNDERVALUING THE GOD WHO MADE HIM AND MADE HIM A MOST EXCELLENTPREACHER.THAT MUST BE A HINT FOR ME TO TAKE MR. LYDGATE AWAY TO MY STUDYMOTHER SAID THE VICAR LAUGHING. I PROMISED TO SHOW YOU MYCOLLECTION HE ADDED TURNING TO LYDGATE SHALL WE GOALL THREE LADIES REMONSTRATED. MR. LYDGATE OUGHT NOT TO BE HURRIED AWAYWITHOUT BEING ALLOWED TO ACCEPT ANOTHER CUP OF TEA MISS WINIFRED HADABUNDANCE OF GOOD TEA IN THE POT. WHY WAS CAMDEN IN SUCH HASTE TO TAKEA VISITOR TO HIS DEN THERE WAS NOTHING BUT PICKLED VERMIN AND DRAWERSFULL OF BLUEBOTTLES AND MOTHS WITH NO CARPET ON THE FLOOR. MR.LYDGATE MUST EXCUSE IT. A GAME AT CRIBBAGE WOULD BE FAR BETTER. INSHORT IT WAS PLAIN THAT A VICAR MIGHT BE ADORED BY HIS WOMANKIND ASTHE KING OF MEN AND PREACHERS AND YET BE HELD BY THEM TO STAND IN MUCHNEED OF THEIR DIRECTION. LYDGATE WITH THE USUAL SHALLOWNESS OF A YOUNGBACHELOR WONDERED THAT MR. FAREBROTHER HAD NOT TAUGHT THEM BETTER.MY MOTHER IS NOT USED TO MY HAVING VISITORS WHO CAN TAKE ANY INTERESTIN MY HOBBIES SAID THE VICAR AS HE OPENED THE DOOR OF HIS STUDYWHICH WAS INDEED AS BARE OF LUXURIES FOR THE BODY AS THE LADIES HADIMPLIED UNLESS A SHORT PORCELAIN PIPE AND A TOBACCOBOX WERE TO BEEXCEPTED.MEN OF YOUR PROFESSION DONT GENERALLY SMOKE HE SAID. LYDGATE SMILEDAND SHOOK HIS HEAD. NOR OF MINE EITHER PROPERLY I SUPPOSE. YOU WILLHEAR THAT PIPE ALLEGED AGAINST ME BY BULSTRODE AND COMPANY. THEY DONTKNOW HOW PLEASED THE DEVIL WOULD BE IF I GAVE IT UP.I UNDERSTAND. YOU ARE OF AN EXCITABLE TEMPER AND WANT A SEDATIVE. I AMHEAVIER AND SHOULD GET IDLE WITH IT. I SHOULD RUSH INTO IDLENESS ANDSTAGNATE THERE WITH ALL MY MIGHT.AND YOU MEAN TO GIVE IT ALL TO YOUR WORK. I AM SOME TEN OR TWELVEYEARS OLDER THAN YOU AND HAVE COME TO A COMPROMISE. I FEED A WEAKNESSOR TWO LEST THEY SHOULD GET CLAMOROUS. SEE CONTINUED THE VICAROPENING SEVERAL SMALL DRAWERS I FANCY I HAVE MADE AN EXHAUSTIVE STUDYOF THE ENTOMOLOGY OF THIS DISTRICT. I AM GOING ON BOTH WITH THE FAUNAAND FLORA BUT I HAVE AT LEAST DONE MY INSECTS WELL. WE ARE SINGULARLYRICH IN ORTHOPTERA I DONT KNOW WHETHERAH YOU HAVE GOT HOLD OF THATGLASS JARYOU ARE LOOKING INTO THAT INSTEAD OF MY DRAWERS. YOU DONTREALLY CARE ABOUT THESE THINGSNOT BY THE SIDE OF THIS LOVELY ANENCEPHALOUS MONSTER. I HAVE NEVER HADTIME TO GIVE MYSELF MUCH TO NATURAL HISTORY. I WAS EARLY BITTEN WITH ANINTEREST IN STRUCTURE AND IT IS WHAT LIES MOST DIRECTLY IN MYPROFESSION. I HAVE NO HOBBY BESIDES. I HAVE THE SEA TO SWIM IN THERE.AH YOU ARE A HAPPY FELLOW SAID MR. FAREBROTHER TURNING ON HIS HEELAND BEGINNING TO FILL HIS PIPE. YOU DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WANTSPIRITUAL TOBACCOBAD EMENDATIONS OF OLD TEXTS OR SMALL ITEMS ABOUT AVARIETY OF APHIS BRASSICAE WITH THE WELLKNOWN SIGNATURE OFPHILOMICRON FOR THE TWADDLERS MAGAZINE OR A LEARNED TREATISE ONTHE ENTOMOLOGY OF THE PENTATEUCH INCLUDING ALL THE INSECTS NOTMENTIONED BUT PROBABLY MET WITH BY THE ISRAELITES IN THEIR PASSAGETHROUGH THE DESERT WITH A MONOGRAPH ON THE ANT AS TREATED BY SOLOMONSHOWING THE HARMONY OF THE BOOK OF PROVERBS WITH THE RESULTS OF MODERNRESEARCH. YOU DONT MIND MY FUMIGATING YOULYDGATE WAS MORE SURPRISED AT THE OPENNESS OF THIS TALK THAN AT ITSIMPLIED MEANINGTHAT THE VICAR FELT HIMSELF NOT ALTOGETHER IN THE RIGHTVOCATION. THE NEAT FITTINGUP OF DRAWERS AND SHELVES AND THE BOOKCASEFILLED WITH EXPENSIVE ILLUSTRATED BOOKS ON NATURAL HISTORY MADE HIMTHINK AGAIN OF THE WINNINGS AT CARDS AND THEIR DESTINATION. BUT HE WASBEGINNING TO WISH THAT THE VERY BEST CONSTRUCTION OF EVERYTHING THATMR. FAREBROTHER DID SHOULD BE THE TRUE ONE. THE VICARS FRANKNESSSEEMED NOT OF THE REPULSIVE SORT THAT COMES FROM AN UNEASYCONSCIOUSNESS SEEKING TO FORESTALL THE JUDGMENT OF OTHERS BUT SIMPLYTHE RELIEF OF A DESIRE TO DO WITH AS LITTLE PRETENCE AS POSSIBLE.APPARENTLY HE WAS NOT WITHOUT A SENSE THAT HIS FREEDOM OF SPEECH MIGHTSEEM PREMATURE FOR HE PRESENTLY SAIDI HAVE NOT YET TOLD YOU THAT I HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF YOU MR. LYDGATEAND KNOW YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW ME. YOU REMEMBER TRAWLEY WHO SHAREDYOUR APARTMENT AT PARIS FOR SOME TIME I WAS A CORRESPONDENT OF HISAND HE TOLD ME A GOOD DEAL ABOUT YOU. I WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHEN YOUFIRST CAME THAT YOU WERE THE SAME MAN. I WAS VERY GLAD WHEN I FOUNDTHAT YOU WERE. ONLY I DONT FORGET THAT YOU HAVE NOT HAD THE LIKEPROLOGUE ABOUT ME.LYDGATE DIVINED SOME DELICACY OF FEELING HERE BUT DID NOT HALFUNDERSTAND IT. BY THE WAY HE SAID WHAT HAS BECOME OF TRAWLEY IHAVE QUITE LOST SIGHT OF HIM. HE WAS HOT ON THE FRENCH SOCIAL SYSTEMSAND TALKED OF GOING TO THE BACKWOODS TO FOUND A SORT OF PYTHAGOREANCOMMUNITY. IS HE GONENOT AT ALL. HE IS PRACTISING AT A GERMAN BATH AND HAS MARRIED A RICHPATIENT.THEN MY NOTIONS WEAR THE BEST SO FAR SAID LYDGATE WITH A SHORTSCORNFUL LAUGH. HE WOULD HAVE IT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WAS ANINEVITABLE SYSTEM OF HUMBUG. I SAID THE FAULT WAS IN THE MENMEN WHOTRUCKLE TO LIES AND FOLLY. INSTEAD OF PREACHING AGAINST HUMBUG OUTSIDETHE WALLS IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO SET UP A DISINFECTING APPARATUSWITHIN. IN SHORTI AM REPORTING MY OWN CONVERSATIONYOU MAY BE SURE IHAD ALL THE GOOD SENSE ON MY SIDE.YOUR SCHEME IS A GOOD DEAL MORE DIFFICULT TO CARRY OUT THAN THEPYTHAGOREAN COMMUNITY THOUGH. YOU HAVE NOT ONLY GOT THE OLD ADAM INYOURSELF AGAINST YOU BUT YOU HAVE GOT ALL THOSE DESCENDANTS OF THEORIGINAL ADAM WHO FORM THE SOCIETY AROUND YOU. YOU SEE I HAVE PAIDTWELVE OR THIRTEEN YEARS MORE THAN YOU FOR MY KNOWLEDGE OFDIFFICULTIES. BUTMR. FAREBROTHER BROKE OFF A MOMENT AND THEN ADDEDYOU ARE EYING THAT GLASS VASE AGAIN. DO YOU WANT TO MAKE AN EXCHANGEYOU SHALL NOT HAVE IT WITHOUT A FAIR BARTER.I HAVE SOME SEAMICEFINE SPECIMENSIN SPIRITS. AND I WILL THROW INROBERT BROWNS NEW THINGMICROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS ON THE POLLEN OFPLANTSIF YOU DONT HAPPEN TO HAVE IT ALREADY.WHY SEEING HOW YOU LONG FOR THE MONSTER I MIGHT ASK A HIGHER PRICE.SUPPOSE I ASK YOU TO LOOK THROUGH MY DRAWERS AND AGREE WITH ME ABOUTALL MY NEW SPECIES THE VICAR WHILE HE TALKED IN THIS WAYALTERNATELY MOVED ABOUT WITH HIS PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND RETURNED TOHANG RATHER FONDLY OVER HIS DRAWERS. THAT WOULD BE GOOD DISCIPLINEYOU KNOW FOR A YOUNG DOCTOR WHO HAS TO PLEASE HIS PATIENTS INMIDDLEMARCH. YOU MUST LEARN TO BE BORED REMEMBER. HOWEVER YOU SHALLHAVE THE MONSTER ON YOUR OWN TERMS.DONT YOU THINK MEN OVERRATE THE NECESSITY FOR HUMORING EVERYBODYSNONSENSE TILL THEY GET DESPISED BY THE VERY FOOLS THEY HUMOR SAIDLYDGATE MOVING TO MR. FAREBROTHERS SIDE AND LOOKING RATHER ABSENTLYAT THE INSECTS RANGED IN FINE GRADATION WITH NAMES SUBSCRIBED INEXQUISITE WRITING. THE SHORTEST WAY IS TO MAKE YOUR VALUE FELT SOTHAT PEOPLE MUST PUT UP WITH YOU WHETHER YOU FLATTER THEM OR NOT.WITH ALL MY HEART. BUT THEN YOU MUST BE SURE OF HAVING THE VALUE ANDYOU MUST KEEP YOURSELF INDEPENDENT. VERY FEW MEN CAN DO THAT. EITHERYOU SLIP OUT OF SERVICE ALTOGETHER AND BECOME GOOD FOR NOTHING OR YOUWEAR THE HARNESS AND DRAW A GOOD DEAL WHERE YOUR YOKEFELLOWS PULL YOU.BUT DO LOOK AT THESE DELICATE ORTHOPTERALYDGATE HAD AFTER ALL TO GIVE SOME SCRUTINY TO EACH DRAWER THE VICARLAUGHING AT HIMSELF AND YET PERSISTING IN THE EXHIBITION.APROPOS OF WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT WEARING HARNESS LYDGATE BEGAN AFTERTHEY HAD SAT DOWN I MADE UP MY MIND SOME TIME AGO TO DO WITH ASLITTLE OF IT AS POSSIBLE. THAT WAS WHY I DETERMINED NOT TO TRY ANYTHINGIN LONDON FOR A GOOD MANY YEARS AT LEAST. I DIDNT LIKE WHAT I SAWWHEN I WAS STUDYING THERESO MUCH EMPTY BIGWIGGISM AND OBSTRUCTIVETRICKERY. IN THE COUNTRY PEOPLE HAVE LESS PRETENSION TO KNOWLEDGE ANDARE LESS OF COMPANIONS BUT FOR THAT REASON THEY AFFECT ONESAMOURPROPRE LESS ONE MAKES LESS BAD BLOOD AND CAN FOLLOW ONES OWNCOURSE MORE QUIETLY.YESWELLYOU HAVE GOT A GOOD START YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PROFESSIONTHE WORK YOU FEEL YOURSELF MOST FIT FOR. SOME PEOPLE MISS THAT ANDREPENT TOO LATE. BUT YOU MUST NOT BE TOO SURE OF KEEPING YOURINDEPENDENCE.YOU MEAN OF FAMILY TIES SAID LYDGATE CONCEIVING THAT THESE MIGHTPRESS RATHER TIGHTLY ON MR. FAREBROTHER.NOT ALTOGETHER. OF COURSE THEY MAKE MANY THINGS MORE DIFFICULT. BUT AGOOD WIFEA GOOD UNWORLDLY WOMANMAY REALLY HELP A MAN AND KEEP HIMMORE INDEPENDENT. THERES A PARISHIONER OF MINEA FINE FELLOW BUT WHOWOULD HARDLY HAVE PULLED THROUGH AS HE HAS DONE WITHOUT HIS WIFE. DOYOU KNOW THE GARTHS I THINK THEY WERE NOT PEACOCKS PATIENTS.NO BUT THERE IS A MISS GARTH AT OLD FEATHERSTONES AT LOWICK.THEIR DAUGHTER AN EXCELLENT GIRL.SHE IS VERY QUIETI HAVE HARDLY NOTICED HER.SHE HAS TAKEN NOTICE OF YOU THOUGH DEPEND UPON IT.I DONT UNDERSTAND SAID LYDGATE HE COULD HARDLY SAY OF COURSE.OH SHE GAUGES EVERYBODY. I PREPARED HER FOR CONFIRMATIONSHE IS AFAVORITE OF MINE.MR. FAREBROTHER PUFFED A FEW MOMENTS IN SILENCE LYDGATE NOT CARING TOKNOW MORE ABOUT THE GARTHS. AT LAST THE VICAR LAID DOWN HIS PIPESTRETCHED OUT HIS LEGS AND TURNED HIS BRIGHT EYES WITH A SMILE TOWARDSLYDGATE SAYINGBUT WE MIDDLEMARCHERS ARE NOT SO TAME AS YOU TAKE US TO BE. WE HAVEOUR INTRIGUES AND OUR PARTIES. I AM A PARTY MAN FOR EXAMPLE ANDBULSTRODE IS ANOTHER. IF YOU VOTE FOR ME YOU WILL OFFEND BULSTRODE.WHAT IS THERE AGAINST BULSTRODE SAID LYDGATE EMPHATICALLY.I DID NOT SAY THERE WAS ANYTHING AGAINST HIM EXCEPT THAT. IF YOU VOTEAGAINST HIM YOU WILL MAKE HIM YOUR ENEMY.I DONT KNOW THAT I NEED MIND ABOUT THAT SAID LYDGATE RATHERPROUDLY BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE GOOD IDEAS ABOUT HOSPITALS AND HESPENDS LARGE SUMS ON USEFUL PUBLIC OBJECTS. HE MIGHT HELP ME A GOODDEAL IN CARRYING OUT MY IDEAS. AS TO HIS RELIGIOUS NOTIONSWHY ASVOLTAIRE SAID INCANTATIONS WILL DESTROY A FLOCK OF SHEEP IFADMINISTERED WITH A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF ARSENIC. I LOOK FOR THE MAN WHOWILL BRING THE ARSENIC AND DONT MIND ABOUT HIS INCANTATIONS.VERY GOOD. BUT THEN YOU MUST NOT OFFEND YOUR ARSENICMAN. YOU WILL NOTOFFEND ME YOU KNOW SAID MR. FAREBROTHER QUITE UNAFFECTEDLY. IDONT TRANSLATE MY OWN CONVENIENCE INTO OTHER PEOPLES DUTIES. I AMOPPOSED TO BULSTRODE IN MANY WAYS. I DONT LIKE THE SET HE BELONGS TOTHEY ARE A NARROW IGNORANT SET AND DO MORE TO MAKE THEIR NEIGHBORSUNCOMFORTABLE THAN TO MAKE THEM BETTER. THEIR SYSTEM IS A SORT OFWORLDLYSPIRITUAL CLIQUEISM THEY REALLY LOOK ON THE REST OF MANKIND ASA DOOMED CARCASS WHICH IS TO NOURISH THEM FOR HEAVEN. BUT HE ADDEDSMILINGLY I DONT SAY THAT BULSTRODES NEW HOSPITAL IS A BAD THINGAND AS TO HIS WANTING TO OUST ME FROM THE OLD ONEWHY IF HE THINKS MEA MISCHIEVOUS FELLOW HE IS ONLY RETURNING A COMPLIMENT. AND I AM NOT AMODEL CLERGYMANONLY A DECENT MAKESHIFT.LYDGATE WAS NOT AT ALL SURE THAT THE VICAR MALIGNED HIMSELF. A MODELCLERGYMAN LIKE A MODEL DOCTOR OUGHT TO THINK HIS OWN PROFESSION THEFINEST IN THE WORLD AND TAKE ALL KNOWLEDGE AS MERE NOURISHMENT TO HISMORAL PATHOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS. HE ONLY SAID WHAT REASON DOESBULSTRODE GIVE FOR SUPERSEDING YOUTHAT I DONT TEACH HIS OPINIONSWHICH HE CALLS SPIRITUAL RELIGION ANDTHAT I HAVE NO TIME TO SPARE. BOTH STATEMENTS ARE TRUE. BUT THEN ICOULD MAKE TIME AND I SHOULD BE GLAD OF THE FORTY POUNDS. THAT IS THEPLAIN FACT OF THE CASE. BUT LET US DISMISS IT. I ONLY WANTED TO TELLYOU THAT IF YOU VOTE FOR YOUR ARSENICMAN YOU ARE NOT TO CUT ME INCONSEQUENCE. I CANT SPARE YOU. YOU ARE A SORT OF CIRCUMNAVIGATOR COMETO SETTLE AMONG US AND WILL KEEP UP MY BELIEF IN THE ANTIPODES. NOWTELL ME ALL ABOUT THEM IN PARIS.CHAPTER XVIII.OH SIR THE LOFTIEST HOPES ON EARTHDRAW LOTS WITH MEANER HOPES HEROIC BREASTSBREATHING BAD AIR RUN RISK OF PESTILENCEOR LACKING LIMEJUICE WHEN THEY CROSS THE LINEMAY LANGUISH WITH THE SCURVY.SOME WEEKS PASSED AFTER THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE THE QUESTION OF THECHAPLAINCY GATHERED ANY PRACTICAL IMPORT FOR LYDGATE AND WITHOUTTELLING HIMSELF THE REASON HE DEFERRED THE PREDETERMINATION ON WHICHSIDE HE SHOULD GIVE HIS VOTE. IT WOULD REALLY HAVE BEEN A MATTER OFTOTAL INDIFFERENCE TO HIMTHAT IS TO SAY HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE MORECONVENIENT SIDE AND GIVEN HIS VOTE FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF TYKE WITHOUTANY HESITATIONIF HE HAD NOT CARED PERSONALLY FOR MR. FAREBROTHER.BUT HIS LIKING FOR THE VICAR OF ST. BOTOLPHS GREW WITH GROWINGACQUAINTANCESHIP. THAT ENTERING INTO LYDGATES POSITION AS A NEWCOMERWHO HAD HIS OWN PROFESSIONAL OBJECTS TO SECURE MR. FAREBROTHER SHOULDHAVE TAKEN PAINS RATHER TO WARN OFF THAN TO OBTAIN HIS INTEREST SHOWEDAN UNUSUAL DELICACY AND GENEROSITY WHICH LYDGATES NATURE WAS KEENLYALIVE TO. IT WENT ALONG WITH OTHER POINTS OF CONDUCT IN MR. FAREBROTHERWHICH WERE EXCEPTIONALLY FINE AND MADE HIS CHARACTER RESEMBLE THOSESOUTHERN LANDSCAPES WHICH SEEM DIVIDED BETWEEN NATURAL GRANDEUR ANDSOCIAL SLOVENLINESS. VERY FEW MEN COULD HAVE BEEN AS FILIAL ANDCHIVALROUS AS HE WAS TO THE MOTHER AUNT AND SISTER WHOSE DEPENDENCEON HIM HAD IN MANY WAYS SHAPED HIS LIFE RATHER UNEASILY FOR HIMSELFFEW MEN WHO FEEL THE PRESSURE OF SMALL NEEDS ARE SO NOBLY RESOLUTE NOTTO DRESS UP THEIR INEVITABLY SELFINTERESTED DESIRES IN A PRETEXT OFBETTER MOTIVES. IN THESE MATTERS HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HIS LIFE WOULDBEAR THE CLOSEST SCRUTINY AND PERHAPS THE CONSCIOUSNESS ENCOURAGED ALITTLE DEFIANCE TOWARDS THE CRITICAL STRICTNESS OF PERSONS WHOSECELESTIAL INTIMACIES SEEMED NOT TO IMPROVE THEIR DOMESTIC MANNERS ANDWHOSE LOFTY AIMS WERE NOT NEEDED TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR ACTIONS. THENHIS PREACHING WAS INGENIOUS AND PITHY LIKE THE PREACHING OF THEENGLISH CHURCH IN ITS ROBUST AGE AND HIS SERMONS WERE DELIVEREDWITHOUT BOOK. PEOPLE OUTSIDE HIS PARISH WENT TO HEAR HIM AND SINCE TOFILL THE CHURCH WAS ALWAYS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF A CLERGYMANSFUNCTION HERE WAS ANOTHER GROUND FOR A CARELESS SENSE OF SUPERIORITY.BESIDES HE WAS A LIKABLE MAN SWEETTEMPERED READYWITTED FRANKWITHOUT GRINS OF SUPPRESSED BITTERNESS OR OTHER CONVERSATIONAL FLAVORSWHICH MAKE HALF OF US AN AFFLICTION TO OUR FRIENDS. LYDGATE LIKED HIMHEARTILY AND WISHED FOR HIS FRIENDSHIP.WITH THIS FEELING UPPERMOST HE CONTINUED TO WAIVE THE QUESTION OF THECHAPLAINCY AND TO PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT IT WAS NOT ONLY NO PROPERBUSINESS OF HIS BUT LIKELY ENOUGH NEVER TO VEX HIM WITH A DEMAND FORHIS VOTE. LYDGATE AT MR. BULSTRODES REQUEST WAS LAYING DOWN PLANSFOR THE INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS OF THE NEW HOSPITAL AND THE TWO WEREOFTEN IN CONSULTATION. THE BANKER WAS ALWAYS PRESUPPOSING THAT HE COULDCOUNT IN GENERAL ON LYDGATE AS A COADJUTOR BUT MADE NO SPECIALRECURRENCE TO THE COMING DECISION BETWEEN TYKE AND FAREBROTHER. WHENTHE GENERAL BOARD OF THE INFIRMARY HAD MET HOWEVER AND LYDGATE HADNOTICE THAT THE QUESTION OF THE CHAPLAINCY WAS THROWN ON A COUNCIL OFTHE DIRECTORS AND MEDICAL MEN TO MEET ON THE FOLLOWING FRIDAY HE HADA VEXED SENSE THAT HE MUST MAKE UP HIS MIND ON THIS TRIVIAL MIDDLEMARCHBUSINESS. HE COULD NOT HELP HEARING WITHIN HIM THE DISTINCT DECLARATIONTHAT BULSTRODE WAS PRIME MINISTER AND THAT THE TYKE AFFAIR WAS AQUESTION OF OFFICE OR NO OFFICE AND HE COULD NOT HELP AN EQUALLYPRONOUNCED DISLIKE TO GIVING UP THE PROSPECT OF OFFICE. FOR HISOBSERVATION WAS CONSTANTLY CONFIRMING MR. FAREBROTHERS ASSURANCE THATTHE BANKER WOULD NOT OVERLOOK OPPOSITION. CONFOUND THEIR PETTYPOLITICS WAS ONE OF HIS THOUGHTS FOR THREE MORNINGS IN THE MEDITATIVEPROCESS OF SHAVING WHEN HE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL THAT HE MUST REALLY HOLDA COURT OF CONSCIENCE ON THIS MATTER. CERTAINLY THERE WERE VALID THINGSTO BE SAID AGAINST THE ELECTION OF MR. FAREBROTHER HE HAD TOO MUCH ONHIS HANDS ALREADY ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING HOW MUCH TIME HE SPENT ONNONCLERICAL OCCUPATIONS. THEN AGAIN IT WAS A CONTINUALLY REPEATEDSHOCK DISTURBING LYDGATES ESTEEM THAT THE VICAR SHOULD OBVIOUSLYPLAY FOR THE SAKE OF MONEY LIKING THE PLAY INDEED BUT EVIDENTLYLIKING SOME END WHICH IT SERVED. MR. FAREBROTHER CONTENDED ON THEORYFOR THE DESIRABILITY OF ALL GAMES AND SAID THAT ENGLISHMENS WIT WASSTAGNANT FOR WANT OF THEM BUT LYDGATE FELT CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD HAVEPLAYED VERY MUCH LESS BUT FOR THE MONEY. THERE WAS A BILLIARDROOM ATTHE GREEN DRAGON WHICH SOME ANXIOUS MOTHERS AND WIVES REGARDED AS THECHIEF TEMPTATION IN MIDDLEMARCH. THE VICAR WAS A FIRSTRATEBILLIARDPLAYER AND THOUGH HE DID NOT FREQUENT THE GREEN DRAGON THEREWERE REPORTS THAT HE HAD SOMETIMES BEEN THERE IN THE DAYTIME AND HADWON MONEY. AND AS TO THE CHAPLAINCY HE DID NOT PRETEND THAT HE CAREDFOR IT EXCEPT FOR THE SAKE OF THE FORTY POUNDS. LYDGATE WAS NOPURITAN BUT HE DID NOT CARE FOR PLAY AND WINNING MONEY AT IT HADALWAYS SEEMED A MEANNESS TO HIM BESIDES HE HAD AN IDEAL OF LIFE WHICHMADE THIS SUBSERVIENCE OF CONDUCT TO THE GAINING OF SMALL SUMSTHOROUGHLY HATEFUL TO HIM. HITHERTO IN HIS OWN LIFE HIS WANTS HAD BEENSUPPLIED WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE TO HIMSELF AND HIS FIRST IMPULSE WASALWAYS TO BE LIBERAL WITH HALFCROWNS AS MATTERS OF NO IMPORTANCE TO AGENTLEMAN IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM TO DEVISE A PLAN FOR GETTINGHALFCROWNS. HE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN IN A GENERAL WAY THAT HE WAS NOT RICHBUT HE HAD NEVER FELT POOR AND HE HAD NO POWER OF IMAGINING THE PARTWHICH THE WANT OF MONEY PLAYS IN DETERMINING THE ACTIONS OF MEN. MONEYHAD NEVER BEEN A MOTIVE TO HIM. HENCE HE WAS NOT READY TO FRAME EXCUSESFOR THIS DELIBERATE PURSUIT OF SMALL GAINS. IT WAS ALTOGETHER REPULSIVETO HIM AND HE NEVER ENTERED INTO ANY CALCULATION OF THE RATIO BETWEENTHE VICARS INCOME AND HIS MORE OR LESS NECESSARY EXPENDITURE. IT WASPOSSIBLE THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE MADE SUCH A CALCULATION IN HIS OWNCASE.AND NOW WHEN THE QUESTION OF VOTING HAD COME THIS REPULSIVE FACT TOLDMORE STRONGLY AGAINST MR. FAREBROTHER THAN IT HAD DONE BEFORE. ONEWOULD KNOW MUCH BETTER WHAT TO DO IF MENS CHARACTERS WERE MORECONSISTENT AND ESPECIALLY IF ONES FRIENDS WERE INVARIABLY FIT FOR ANYFUNCTION THEY DESIRED TO UNDERTAKE LYDGATE WAS CONVINCED THAT IF THEREHAD BEEN NO VALID OBJECTION TO MR. FAREBROTHER HE WOULD HAVE VOTED FORHIM WHATEVER BULSTRODE MIGHT HAVE FELT ON THE SUBJECT HE DID NOTINTEND TO BE A VASSAL OF BULSTRODES. ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WASTYKE A MAN ENTIRELY GIVEN TO HIS CLERICAL OFFICE WHO WAS SIMPLYCURATE AT A CHAPEL OF EASE IN ST. PETERS PARISH AND HAD TIME FOREXTRA DUTY. NOBODY HAD ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST MR. TYKE EXCEPT THATTHEY COULD NOT BEAR HIM AND SUSPECTED HIM OF CANT. REALLY FROM HISPOINT OF VIEW BULSTRODE WAS THOROUGHLY JUSTIFIED.BUT WHICHEVER WAY LYDGATE BEGAN TO INCLINE THERE WAS SOMETHING TO MAKEHIM WINCE AND BEING A PROUD MAN HE WAS A LITTLE EXASPERATED AT BEINGOBLIGED TO WINCE. HE DID NOT LIKE FRUSTRATING HIS OWN BEST PURPOSES BYGETTING ON BAD TERMS WITH BULSTRODE HE DID NOT LIKE VOTING AGAINSTFAREBROTHER AND HELPING TO DEPRIVE HIM OF FUNCTION AND SALARY AND THEQUESTION OCCURRED WHETHER THE ADDITIONAL FORTY POUNDS MIGHT NOT LEAVETHE VICAR FREE FROM THAT IGNOBLE CARE ABOUT WINNING AT CARDS. MOREOVERLYDGATE DID NOT LIKE THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IN VOTING FOR TYKE HESHOULD BE VOTING ON THE SIDE OBVIOUSLY CONVENIENT FOR HIMSELF. BUTWOULD THE END REALLY BE HIS OWN CONVENIENCE OTHER PEOPLE WOULD SAY SOAND WOULD ALLEGE THAT HE WAS CURRYING FAVOR WITH BULSTRODE FOR THE SAKEOF MAKING HIMSELF IMPORTANT AND GETTING ON IN THE WORLD. WHAT THEN HEFOR HIS OWN PART KNEW THAT IF HIS PERSONAL PROSPECTS SIMPLY HAD BEENCONCERNED HE WOULD NOT HAVE CARED A ROTTEN NUT FOR THE BANKERSFRIENDSHIP OR ENMITY. WHAT HE REALLY CARED FOR WAS A MEDIUM FOR HISWORK A VEHICLE FOR HIS IDEAS AND AFTER ALL WAS HE NOT BOUND TOPREFER THE OBJECT OF GETTING A GOOD HOSPITAL WHERE HE COULDDEMONSTRATE THE SPECIFIC DISTINCTIONS OF FEVER AND TEST THERAPEUTICRESULTS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE CONNECTED WITH THIS CHAPLAINCY FOR THEFIRST TIME LYDGATE WAS FEELING THE HAMPERING THREADLIKE PRESSURE OFSMALL SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND THEIR FRUSTRATING COMPLEXITY. AT THE ENDOF HIS INWARD DEBATE WHEN HE SET OUT FOR THE HOSPITAL HIS HOPE WASREALLY IN THE CHANCE THAT DISCUSSION MIGHT SOMEHOW GIVE A NEW ASPECT TOTHE QUESTION AND MAKE THE SCALE DIP SO AS TO EXCLUDE THE NECESSITY FORVOTING. I THINK HE TRUSTED A LITTLE ALSO TO THE ENERGY WHICH ISBEGOTTEN BY CIRCUMSTANCESSOME FEELING RUSHING WARMLY AND MAKINGRESOLVE EASY WHILE DEBATE IN COOL BLOOD HAD ONLY MADE IT MOREDIFFICULT. HOWEVER IT WAS HE DID NOT DISTINCTLY SAY TO HIMSELF ONWHICH SIDE HE WOULD VOTE AND ALL THE WHILE HE WAS INWARDLY RESENTINGTHE SUBJECTION WHICH HAD BEEN FORCED UPON HIM. IT WOULD HAVE SEEMEDBEFOREHAND LIKE A RIDICULOUS PIECE OF BAD LOGIC THAT HE WITH HISUNMIXED RESOLUTIONS OF INDEPENDENCE AND HIS SELECT PURPOSES WOULD FINDHIMSELF AT THE VERY OUTSET IN THE GRASP OF PETTY ALTERNATIVES EACH OFWHICH WAS REPUGNANT TO HIM. IN HIS STUDENTS CHAMBERS HE HADPREARRANGED HIS SOCIAL ACTION QUITE DIFFERENTLY.LYDGATE WAS LATE IN SETTING OUT BUT DR. SPRAGUE THE TWO OTHERSURGEONS AND SEVERAL OF THE DIRECTORS HAD ARRIVED EARLY MR.BULSTRODE TREASURER AND CHAIRMAN BEING AMONG THOSE WHO WERE STILLABSENT. THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT THE ISSUE WASPROBLEMATICAL AND THAT A MAJORITY FOR TYKE WAS NOT SO CERTAIN AS HADBEEN GENERALLY SUPPOSED. THE TWO PHYSICIANS FOR A WONDER TURNED OUTTO BE UNANIMOUS OR RATHER THOUGH OF DIFFERENT MINDS THEY CONCURREDIN ACTION. DR. SPRAGUE THE RUGGED AND WEIGHTY WAS AS EVERY ONE HADFORESEEN AN ADHERENT OF MR. FAREBROTHER. THE DOCTOR WAS MORE THANSUSPECTED OF HAVING NO RELIGION BUT SOMEHOW MIDDLEMARCH TOLERATED THISDEFICIENCY IN HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN A LORD CHANCELLOR INDEED IT ISPROBABLE THAT HIS PROFESSIONAL WEIGHT WAS THE MORE BELIEVED IN THEWORLDOLD ASSOCIATION OF CLEVERNESS WITH THE EVIL PRINCIPLE BEING STILLPOTENT IN THE MINDS EVEN OF LADYPATIENTS WHO HAD THE STRICTEST IDEASOF FRILLING AND SENTIMENT. IT WAS PERHAPS THIS NEGATION IN THE DOCTORWHICH MADE HIS NEIGHBORS CALL HIM HARDHEADED AND DRYWITTEDCONDITIONS OF TEXTURE WHICH WERE ALSO HELD FAVORABLE TO THE STORING OFJUDGMENTS CONNECTED WITH DRUGS. AT ALL EVENTS IT IS CERTAIN THAT IFANY MEDICAL MAN HAD COME TO MIDDLEMARCH WITH THE REPUTATION OF HAVINGVERY DEFINITE RELIGIOUS VIEWS OF BEING GIVEN TO PRAYER AND OFOTHERWISE SHOWING AN ACTIVE PIETY THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GENERALPRESUMPTION AGAINST HIS MEDICAL SKILL.ON THIS GROUND IT WAS PROFESSIONALLY SPEAKING FORTUNATE FOR DR.MINCHIN THAT HIS RELIGIOUS SYMPATHIES WERE OF A GENERAL KIND AND SUCHAS GAVE A DISTANT MEDICAL SANCTION TO ALL SERIOUS SENTIMENT WHETHER OFCHURCH OR DISSENT RATHER THAN ANY ADHESION TO PARTICULAR TENETS. IFMR. BULSTRODE INSISTED AS HE WAS APT TO DO ON THE LUTHERAN DOCTRINEOF JUSTIFICATION AS THAT BY WHICH A CHURCH MUST STAND OR FALL DR.MINCHIN IN RETURN WAS QUITE SURE THAT MAN WAS NOT A MERE MACHINE OR AFORTUITOUS CONJUNCTION OF ATOMS IF MRS. WIMPLE INSISTED ON APARTICULAR PROVIDENCE IN RELATION TO HER STOMACH COMPLAINT DR. MINCHINFOR HIS PART LIKED TO KEEP THE MENTAL WINDOWS OPEN AND OBJECTED TOFIXED LIMITS IF THE UNITARIAN BREWER JESTED ABOUT THE ATHANASIANCREED DR. MINCHIN QUOTED POPES ESSAY ON MAN. HE OBJECTED TO THERATHER FREE STYLE OF ANECDOTE IN WHICH DR. SPRAGUE INDULGED PREFERRINGWELLSANCTIONED QUOTATIONS AND LIKING REFINEMENT OF ALL KINDS IT WASGENERALLY KNOWN THAT HE HAD SOME KINSHIP TO A BISHOP AND SOMETIMESSPENT HIS HOLIDAYS AT THE PALACE.DR. MINCHIN WAS SOFTHANDED PALECOMPLEXIONED AND OF ROUNDED OUTLINENOT TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM A MILD CLERGYMAN IN APPEARANCE WHEREASDR. SPRAGUE WAS SUPERFLUOUSLY TALL HIS TROUSERS GOT CREASED AT THEKNEES AND SHOWED AN EXCESS OF BOOT AT A TIME WHEN STRAPS SEEMEDNECESSARY TO ANY DIGNITY OF BEARING YOU HEARD HIM GO IN AND OUT ANDUP AND DOWN AS IF HE HAD COME TO SEE AFTER THE ROOFING. IN SHORT HEHAD WEIGHT AND MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO GRAPPLE WITH A DISEASE AND THROWIT WHILE DR. MINCHIN MIGHT BE BETTER ABLE TO DETECT IT LURKING AND TOCIRCUMVENT IT. THEY ENJOYED ABOUT EQUALLY THE MYSTERIOUS PRIVILEGE OFMEDICAL REPUTATION AND CONCEALED WITH MUCH ETIQUETTE THEIR CONTEMPTFOR EACH OTHERS SKILL. REGARDING THEMSELVES AS MIDDLEMARCHINSTITUTIONS THEY WERE READY TO COMBINE AGAINST ALL INNOVATORS ANDAGAINST NONPROFESSIONALS GIVEN TO INTERFERENCE. ON THIS GROUND THEYWERE BOTH IN THEIR HEARTS EQUALLY AVERSE TO MR. BULSTRODE THOUGH DR.MINCHIN HAD NEVER BEEN IN OPEN HOSTILITY WITH HIM AND NEVER DIFFEREDFROM HIM WITHOUT ELABORATE EXPLANATION TO MRS. BULSTRODE WHO HAD FOUNDTHAT DR. MINCHIN ALONE UNDERSTOOD HER CONSTITUTION. A LAYMAN WHO PRIEDINTO THE PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT OF MEDICAL MEN AND WAS ALWAYS OBTRUDINGHIS REFORMSTHOUGH HE WAS LESS DIRECTLY EMBARRASSING TO THE TWOPHYSICIANS THAN TO THE SURGEONAPOTHECARIES WHO ATTENDED PAUPERS BYCONTRACT WAS NEVERTHELESS OFFENSIVE TO THE PROFESSIONAL NOSTRIL ASSUCH AND DR. MINCHIN SHARED FULLY IN THE NEW PIQUE AGAINST BULSTRODEEXCITED BY HIS APPARENT DETERMINATION TO PATRONIZE LYDGATE. THELONGESTABLISHED PRACTITIONERS MR. WRENCH AND MR. TOLLER WERE JUSTNOW STANDING APART AND HAVING A FRIENDLY COLLOQUY IN WHICH THEY AGREEDTHAT LYDGATE WAS A JACKANAPES JUST MADE TO SERVE BULSTRODES PURPOSE.TO NONMEDICAL FRIENDS THEY HAD ALREADY CONCURRED IN PRAISING THE OTHERYOUNG PRACTITIONER WHO HAD COME INTO THE TOWN ON MR. PEACOCKSRETIREMENT WITHOUT FURTHER RECOMMENDATION THAN HIS OWN MERITS AND SUCHARGUMENT FOR SOLID PROFESSIONAL ACQUIREMENT AS MIGHT BE GATHERED FROMHIS HAVING APPARENTLY WASTED NO TIME ON OTHER BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE. ITWAS CLEAR THAT LYDGATE BY NOT DISPENSING DRUGS INTENDED TO CASTIMPUTATIONS ON HIS EQUALS AND ALSO TO OBSCURE THE LIMIT BETWEEN HISOWN RANK AS A GENERAL PRACTITIONER AND THAT OF THE PHYSICIANS WHO INTHE INTEREST OF THE PROFESSION FELT BOUND TO MAINTAIN ITS VARIOUSGRADESESPECIALLY AGAINST A MAN WHO HAD NOT BEEN TO EITHER OF THEENGLISH UNIVERSITIES AND ENJOYED THE ABSENCE OF ANATOMICAL AND BEDSIDESTUDY THERE BUT CAME WITH A LIBELLOUS PRETENSION TO EXPERIENCE INEDINBURGH AND PARIS WHERE OBSERVATION MIGHT BE ABUNDANT INDEED BUTHARDLY SOUND.THUS IT HAPPENED THAT ON THIS OCCASION BULSTRODE BECAME IDENTIFIED WITHLYDGATE AND LYDGATE WITH TYKE AND OWING TO THIS VARIETY OFINTERCHANGEABLE NAMES FOR THE CHAPLAINCY QUESTION DIVERSE MINDS WEREENABLED TO FORM THE SAME JUDGMENT CONCERNING IT.DR. SPRAGUE SAID AT ONCE BLUNTLY TO THE GROUP ASSEMBLED WHEN HEENTERED I GO FOR FAREBROTHER. A SALARY WITH ALL MY HEART. BUT WHYTAKE IT FROM THE VICAR HE HAS NONE TOO MUCHHAS TO INSURE HIS LIFEBESIDES KEEPING HOUSE AND DOING A VICARS CHARITIES. PUT FORTY POUNDSIN HIS POCKET AND YOULL DO NO HARM. HES A GOOD FELLOW ISFAREBROTHER WITH AS LITTLE OF THE PARSON ABOUT HIM AS WILL SERVE TOCARRY ORDERS.HO HO DOCTOR SAID OLD MR. POWDERELL A RETIRED IRONMONGER OF SOMESTANDINGHIS INTERJECTION BEING SOMETHING BETWEEN A LAUGH AND APARLIAMENTARY DISAPPROVAL WE MUST LET YOU HAVE YOUR SAY. BUT WHAT WEHAVE TO CONSIDER IS NOT ANYBODYS INCOMEITS THE SOULS OF THE POORSICK PEOPLEHERE MR. POWDERELLS VOICE AND FACE HAD A SINCERE PATHOSIN THEM. HE IS A REAL GOSPEL PREACHER IS MR. TYKE. I SHOULD VOTEAGAINST MY CONSCIENCE IF I VOTED AGAINST MR. TYKEI SHOULD INDEED.MR. TYKES OPPONENTS HAVE NOT ASKED ANY ONE TO VOTE AGAINST HISCONSCIENCE I BELIEVE SAID MR. HACKBUTT A RICH TANNER OF FLUENTSPEECH WHOSE GLITTERING SPECTACLES AND ERECT HAIR WERE TURNED WITHSOME SEVERITY TOWARDS INNOCENT MR. POWDERELL. BUT IN MY JUDGMENT ITBEHOVES US AS DIRECTORS TO CONSIDER WHETHER WE WILL REGARD IT AS OURWHOLE BUSINESS TO CARRY OUT PROPOSITIONS EMANATING FROM A SINGLEQUARTER. WILL ANY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE AVER THAT HE WOULD HAVEENTERTAINED THE IDEA OF DISPLACING THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS ALWAYSDISCHARGED THE FUNCTION OF CHAPLAIN HERE IF IT HAD NOT BEEN SUGGESTEDTO HIM BY PARTIES WHOSE DISPOSITION IT IS TO REGARD EVERY INSTITUTIONOF THIS TOWN AS A MACHINERY FOR CARRYING OUT THEIR OWN VIEWS I TAX NOMANS MOTIVES LET THEM LIE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND A HIGHER POWER BUT IDO SAY THAT THERE ARE INFLUENCES AT WORK HERE WHICH ARE INCOMPATIBLEWITH GENUINE INDEPENDENCE AND THAT A CRAWLING SERVILITY IS USUALLYDICTATED BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH GENTLEMEN SO CONDUCTING THEMSELVESCOULD NOT AFFORD EITHER MORALLY OR FINANCIALLY TO AVOW. I MYSELF AM ALAYMAN BUT I HAVE GIVEN NO INCONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO THE DIVISIONSIN THE CHURCH ANDOH DAMN THE DIVISIONS BURST IN MR. FRANK HAWLEY LAWYER ANDTOWNCLERK WHO RARELY PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE BOARD BUT NOW LOOKEDIN HURRIEDLY WHIP IN HAND. WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM HERE.FAREBROTHER HAS BEEN DOING THE WORKWHAT THERE WASWITHOUT PAY AND IFPAY IS TO BE GIVEN IT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HIM. I CALL IT A CONFOUNDEDJOB TO TAKE THE THING AWAY FROM FAREBROTHER.I THINK IT WOULD BE AS WELL FOR GENTLEMEN NOT TO GIVE THEIR REMARKS APERSONAL BEARING SAID MR. PLYMDALE. I SHALL VOTE FOR THE APPOINTMENTOF MR. TYKE BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN IF MR. HACKBUTT HADNT HINTEDIT THAT I WAS A SERVILE CRAWLER.I DISCLAIM ANY PERSONALITIES. I EXPRESSLY SAID IF I MAY BE ALLOWED TOREPEAT OR EVEN TO CONCLUDE WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO SAYAH HERES MINCHIN SAID MR. FRANK HAWLEY AT WHICH EVERYBODY TURNEDAWAY FROM MR. HACKBUTT LEAVING HIM TO FEEL THE USELESSNESS OF SUPERIORGIFTS IN MIDDLEMARCH. COME DOCTOR I MUST HAVE YOU ON THE RIGHT SIDEEHI HOPE SO SAID DR. MINCHIN NODDING AND SHAKING HANDS HERE ANDTHERE AT WHATEVER COST TO MY FEELINGS.IF THERES ANY FEELING HERE IT SHOULD BE FEELING FOR THE MAN WHO ISTURNED OUT I THINK SAID MR. FRANK HAWLEY.I CONFESS I HAVE FEELINGS ON THE OTHER SIDE ALSO. I HAVE A DIVIDEDESTEEM SAID DR. MINCHIN RUBBING HIS HANDS. I CONSIDER MR. TYKE ANEXEMPLARY MANNONE MORE SOAND I BELIEVE HIM TO BE PROPOSED FROMUNIMPEACHABLE MOTIVES. I FOR MY PART WISH THAT I COULD GIVE HIM MYVOTE. BUT I AM CONSTRAINED TO TAKE A VIEW OF THE CASE WHICH GIVES THEPREPONDERANCE TO MR. FAREBROTHERS CLAIMS. HE IS AN AMIABLE MAN ANABLE PREACHER AND HAS BEEN LONGER AMONG US.OLD MR. POWDERELL LOOKED ON SAD AND SILENT. MR. PLYMDALE SETTLED HISCRAVAT UNEASILY.YOU DONT SET UP FAREBROTHER AS A PATTERN OF WHAT A CLERGYMAN OUGHT TOBE I HOPE SAID MR. LARCHER THE EMINENT CARRIER WHO HAD JUST COMEIN. I HAVE NO ILLWILL TOWARDS HIM BUT I THINK WE OWE SOMETHING TOTHE PUBLIC NOT TO SPEAK OF ANYTHING HIGHER IN THESE APPOINTMENTS. INMY OPINION FAREBROTHER IS TOO LAX FOR A CLERGYMAN. I DONT WISH TOBRING UP PARTICULARS AGAINST HIM BUT HE WILL MAKE A LITTLE ATTENDANCEHERE GO AS FAR AS HE CAN.AND A DEVILISH DEAL BETTER THAN TOO MUCH SAID MR. HAWLEY WHOSE BADLANGUAGE WAS NOTORIOUS IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTY. SICK PEOPLE CANTBEAR SO MUCH PRAYING AND PREACHING. AND THAT METHODISTICAL SORT OFRELIGION IS BAD FOR THE SPIRITSBAD FOR THE INSIDE EH HE ADDEDTURNING QUICKLY ROUND TO THE FOUR MEDICAL MEN WHO WERE ASSEMBLED.BUT ANY ANSWER WAS DISPENSED WITH BY THE ENTRANCE OF THREE GENTLEMENWITH WHOM THERE WERE GREETINGS MORE OR LESS CORDIAL. THESE WERE THEREVEREND EDWARD THESIGER RECTOR OF ST. PETERS MR. BULSTRODE AND OURFRIEND MR. BROOKE OF TIPTON WHO HAD LATELY ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE PUTON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN HIS TURN BUT HAD NEVER BEFORE ATTENDEDHIS ATTENDANCE NOW BEING DUE TO MR. BULSTRODES EXERTIONS. LYDGATE WASTHE ONLY PERSON STILL EXPECTED.EVERY ONE NOW SAT DOWN MR. BULSTRODE PRESIDING PALE ANDSELFRESTRAINED AS USUAL. MR. THESIGER A MODERATE EVANGELICAL WISHEDFOR THE APPOINTMENT OF HIS FRIEND MR. TYKE A ZEALOUS ABLE MAN WHOOFFICIATING AT A CHAPEL OF EASE HAD NOT A CURE OF SOULS TOO EXTENSIVETO LEAVE HIM AMPLE TIME FOR THE NEW DUTY. IT WAS DESIRABLE THATCHAPLAINCIES OF THIS KIND SHOULD BE ENTERED ON WITH A FERVENTINTENTION THEY WERE PECULIAR OPPORTUNITIES FOR SPIRITUAL INFLUENCEAND WHILE IT WAS GOOD THAT A SALARY SHOULD BE ALLOTTED THERE WAS THEMORE NEED FOR SCRUPULOUS WATCHING LEST THE OFFICE SHOULD BE PERVERTEDINTO A MERE QUESTION OF SALARY. MR. THESIGERS MANNER HAD SO MUCH QUIETPROPRIETY THAT OBJECTORS COULD ONLY SIMMER IN SILENCE.MR. BROOKE BELIEVED THAT EVERYBODY MEANT WELL IN THE MATTER. HE HAD NOTHIMSELF ATTENDED TO THE AFFAIRS OF THE INFIRMARY THOUGH HE HAD ASTRONG INTEREST IN WHATEVER WAS FOR THE BENEFIT OF MIDDLEMARCH AND WASMOST HAPPY TO MEET THE GENTLEMEN PRESENT ON ANY PUBLIC QUESTIONANYPUBLIC QUESTION YOU KNOW MR. BROOKE REPEATED WITH HIS NOD OFPERFECT UNDERSTANDING. I AM A GOOD DEAL OCCUPIED AS A MAGISTRATE ANDIN THE COLLECTION OF DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE BUT I REGARD MY TIME ASBEING AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE PUBLICAND IN SHORT MY FRIENDS HAVECONVINCED ME THAT A CHAPLAIN WITH A SALARYA SALARY YOU KNOWIS A VERYGOOD THING AND I AM HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO COME HERE AND VOTE FOR THEAPPOINTMENT OF MR. TYKE WHO I UNDERSTAND IS AN UNEXCEPTIONABLE MANAPOSTOLIC AND ELOQUENT AND EVERYTHING OF THAT KINDAND I AM THE LASTMAN TO WITHHOLD MY VOTEUNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU KNOW.IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU HAVE BEEN CRAMMED WITH ONE SIDE OF THEQUESTION MR. BROOKE SAID MR. FRANK HAWLEY WHO WAS AFRAID OF NOBODYAND WAS A TORY SUSPICIOUS OF ELECTIONEERING INTENTIONS. YOU DONT SEEMTO KNOW THAT ONE OF THE WORTHIEST MEN WE HAVE HAS BEEN DOING DUTY ASCHAPLAIN HERE FOR YEARS WITHOUT PAY AND THAT MR. TYKE IS PROPOSED TOSUPERSEDE HIM.EXCUSE ME MR. HAWLEY SAID MR. BULSTRODE. MR. BROOKE HAS BEEN FULLYINFORMED OF MR. FAREBROTHERS CHARACTER AND POSITION.BY HIS ENEMIES FLASHED OUT MR. HAWLEY.I TRUST THERE IS NO PERSONAL HOSTILITY CONCERNED HERE SAID MR.THESIGER.ILL SWEAR THERE IS THOUGH RETORTED MR. HAWLEY.GENTLEMEN SAID MR. BULSTRODE IN A SUBDUED TONE THE MERITS OF THEQUESTION MAY BE VERY BRIEFLY STATED AND IF ANY ONE PRESENT DOUBTS THATEVERY GENTLEMAN WHO IS ABOUT TO GIVE HIS VOTE HAS NOT BEEN FULLYINFORMED I CAN NOW RECAPITULATE THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT SHOULD WEIGHON EITHER SIDE.I DONT SEE THE GOOD OF THAT SAID MR. HAWLEY. I SUPPOSE WE ALL KNOWWHOM WE MEAN TO VOTE FOR. ANY MAN WHO WANTS TO DO JUSTICE DOES NOT WAITTILL THE LAST MINUTE TO HEAR BOTH SIDES OF THE QUESTION. I HAVE NO TIMETO LOSE AND I PROPOSE THAT THE MATTER BE PUT TO THE VOTE AT ONCE.A BRIEF BUT STILL HOT DISCUSSION FOLLOWED BEFORE EACH PERSON WROTETYKE OR FAREBROTHER ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND SLIPPED IT INTO A GLASSTUMBLER AND IN THE MEAN TIME MR. BULSTRODE SAW LYDGATE ENTER.I PERCEIVE THAT THE VOTES ARE EQUALLY DIVIDED AT PRESENT SAID MR.BULSTRODE IN A CLEAR BITING VOICE. THEN LOOKING UP AT LYDGATETHERE IS A CASTINGVOTE STILL TO BE GIVEN. IT IS YOURS MR. LYDGATEWILL YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH TO WRITETHE THING IS SETTLED NOW SAID MR. WRENCH RISING. WE ALL KNOW HOWMR. LYDGATE WILL VOTE.YOU SEEM TO SPEAK WITH SOME PECULIAR MEANING SIR SAID LYDGATERATHER DEFIANTLY AND KEEPING HIS PENCIL SUSPENDED.I MERELY MEAN THAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO VOTE WITH MR. BULSTRODE. DO YOUREGARD THAT MEANING AS OFFENSIVEIT MAY BE OFFENSIVE TO OTHERS. BUT I SHALL NOT DESIST FROM VOTING WITHHIM ON THAT ACCOUNT. LYDGATE IMMEDIATELY WROTE DOWN TYKE.SO THE REV. WALTER TYKE BECAME CHAPLAIN TO THE INFIRMARY AND LYDGATECONTINUED TO WORK WITH MR. BULSTRODE. HE WAS REALLY UNCERTAIN WHETHERTYKE WERE NOT THE MORE SUITABLE CANDIDATE AND YET HIS CONSCIOUSNESSTOLD HIM THAT IF HE HAD BEEN QUITE FREE FROM INDIRECT BIAS HE SHOULDHAVE VOTED FOR MR. FAREBROTHER. THE AFFAIR OF THE CHAPLAINCY REMAINED ASORE POINT IN HIS MEMORY AS A CASE IN WHICH THIS PETTY MEDIUM OFMIDDLEMARCH HAD BEEN TOO STRONG FOR HIM. HOW COULD A MAN BE SATISFIEDWITH A DECISION BETWEEN SUCH ALTERNATIVES AND UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCESNO MORE THAN HE CAN BE SATISFIED WITH HIS HAT WHICH HE HAS CHOSEN FROMAMONG SUCH SHAPES AS THE RESOURCES OF THE AGE OFFER HIM WEARING IT ATBEST WITH A RESIGNATION WHICH IS CHIEFLY SUPPORTED BY COMPARISON.BUT MR. FAREBROTHER MET HIM WITH THE SAME FRIENDLINESS AS BEFORE. THECHARACTER OF THE PUBLICAN AND SINNER IS NOT ALWAYS PRACTICALLYINCOMPATIBLE WITH THAT OF THE MODERN PHARISEE FOR THE MAJORITY OF USSCARCELY SEE MORE DISTINCTLY THE FAULTINESS OF OUR OWN CONDUCT THAN THEFAULTINESS OF OUR OWN ARGUMENTS OR THE DULNESS OF OUR OWN JOKES. BUTTHE VICAR OF ST. BOTOLPHS HAD CERTAINLY ESCAPED THE SLIGHTEST TINCTUREOF THE PHARISEE AND BY DINT OF ADMITTING TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS TOOMUCH AS OTHER MEN WERE HE HAD BECOME REMARKABLY UNLIKE THEM INTHISTHAT HE COULD EXCUSE OTHERS FOR THINKING SLIGHTLY OF HIM ANDCOULD JUDGE IMPARTIALLY OF THEIR CONDUCT EVEN WHEN IT TOLD AGAINST HIM.THE WORLD HAS BEEN TOO STRONG FOR ME I KNOW HE SAID ONE DAY TOLYDGATE. BUT THEN I AM NOT A MIGHTY MANI SHALL NEVER BE A MAN OFRENOWN. THE CHOICE OF HERCULES IS A PRETTY FABLE BUT PRODICUS MAKES ITEASY WORK FOR THE HERO AS IF THE FIRST RESOLVES WERE ENOUGH. ANOTHERSTORY SAYS THAT HE CAME TO HOLD THE DISTAFF AND AT LAST WORE THENESSUS SHIRT. I SUPPOSE ONE GOOD RESOLVE MIGHT KEEP A MAN RIGHT IFEVERYBODY ELSES RESOLVE HELPED HIM.THE VICARS TALK WAS NOT ALWAYS INSPIRITING HE HAD ESCAPED BEING APHARISEE BUT HE HAD NOT ESCAPED THAT LOW ESTIMATE OF POSSIBILITIESWHICH WE RATHER HASTILY ARRIVE AT AS AN INFERENCE FROM OUR OWN FAILURE.LYDGATE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS A PITIABLE INFIRMITY OF WILL IN MR.FAREBROTHER.CHAPTER XIX.L ALTRA VEDETE CHHA FATTO ALLA GUANCIADELLA SUA PALMA SOSPIRANDO LETTO.PURGATORIO VII.WHEN GEORGE THE FOURTH WAS STILL REIGNING OVER THE PRIVACIES OFWINDSOR WHEN THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON WAS PRIME MINISTER AND MR. VINCYWAS MAYOR OF THE OLD CORPORATION IN MIDDLEMARCH MRS. CASAUBON BORNDOROTHEA BROOKE HAD TAKEN HER WEDDING JOURNEY TO ROME. IN THOSE DAYSTHE WORLD IN GENERAL WAS MORE IGNORANT OF GOOD AND EVIL BY FORTY YEARSTHAN IT IS AT PRESENT.

HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY ABSORBED NOT TO NOTICE THEAPPROACH OF A DARKEYED ANIMATED GERMAN WHO CAME UP TO HIM AND PLACINGA HAND ON HIS SHOULDER SAID WITH A STRONG ACCENT COME HERE QUICKELSE SHE WILL HAVE CHANGED HER POSE.QUICKNESS WAS READY AT THE CALL AND THE TWO FIGURES PASSED LIGHTLYALONG BY THE MELEAGER TOWARDS THE HALL WHERE THE RECLINING ARIADNETHEN CALLED THE CLEOPATRA LIES IN THE MARBLE VOLUPTUOUSNESS OF HERBEAUTY THE DRAPERY FOLDING AROUND HER WITH A PETALLIKE EASE ANDTENDERNESS. THEY WERE JUST IN TIME TO SEE ANOTHER FIGURE STANDINGAGAINST A PEDESTAL NEAR THE RECLINING MARBLE A BREATHING BLOOMINGGIRL WHOSE FORM NOT SHAMED BY THE ARIADNE WAS CLAD IN QUAKERISH GRAYDRAPERY HER LONG CLOAK FASTENED AT THE NECK WAS THROWN BACKWARD FROMHER ARMS AND ONE BEAUTIFUL UNGLOVED HAND PILLOWED HER CHEEK PUSHINGSOMEWHAT BACKWARD THE WHITE BEAVER BONNET WHICH MADE A SORT OF HALO TOHER FACE AROUND THE SIMPLY BRAIDED DARKBROWN HAIR. SHE WAS NOT LOOKINGAT THE SCULPTURE PROBABLY NOT THINKING OF IT HER LARGE EYES WEREFIXED DREAMILY ON A STREAK OF SUNLIGHT WHICH FELL ACROSS THE FLOOR. BUTSHE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE TWO STRANGERS WHO SUDDENLY PAUSED AS IF TOCONTEMPLATE THE CLEOPATRA AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT THEM IMMEDIATELYTURNED AWAY TO JOIN A MAIDSERVANT AND COURIER WHO WERE LOITERING ALONGTHE HALL AT A LITTLE DISTANCE OFF.WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT FOR A FINE BIT OF ANTITHESIS SAID THEGERMAN SEARCHING IN HIS FRIENDS FACE FOR RESPONDING ADMIRATION BUTGOING ON VOLUBLY WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY OTHER ANSWER.

CASAUBON.GOOD. SUPPOSE I GET ACQUAINTED WITH HER IN SPITE OF YOU AND FIND THATSHE VERY MUCH WISHES TO BE PAINTEDYES SUPPOSE SAID WILL LADISLAW IN A CONTEMPTUOUS UNDERTONEINTENDED TO DISMISS THE SUBJECT. HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING IRRITATED BYRIDICULOUSLY SMALL CAUSES WHICH WERE HALF OF HIS OWN CREATION. WHY WASHE MAKING ANY FUSS ABOUT MRS. CASAUBON AND YET HE FELT AS IF SOMETHINGHAD HAPPENED TO HIM WITH REGARD TO HER. THERE ARE CHARACTERS WHICH ARECONTINUALLY CREATING COLLISIONS AND NODES FOR THEMSELVES IN DRAMASWHICH NOBODY IS PREPARED TO ACT WITH THEM. THEIR SUSCEPTIBILITIES WILLCLASH AGAINST OBJECTS THAT REMAIN INNOCENTLY QUIET.CHAPTER XX.A CHILD FORSAKEN WAKING SUDDENLYWHOSE GAZE AFEARD ON ALL THINGS ROUND DOTH ROVEAND SEETH ONLY THAT IT CANNOT SEE    THE MEETING EYES OF LOVE.TWO HOURS LATER DOROTHEA WAS SEATED IN AN INNER ROOM OR BOUDOIR OF AHANDSOME APARTMENT IN THE VIA SISTINA.I AM SORRY TO ADD THAT SHE WAS SOBBING BITTERLY WITH SUCH ABANDONMENTTO THIS RELIEF OF AN OPPRESSED HEART AS A WOMAN HABITUALLY CONTROLLEDBY PRIDE ON HER OWN ACCOUNT AND THOUGHTFULNESS FOR OTHERS WILLSOMETIMES ALLOW HERSELF WHEN SHE FEELS SECURELY ALONE. AND MR. CASAUBONWAS CERTAIN TO REMAIN AWAY FOR SOME TIME AT THE VATICAN.YET DOROTHEA HAD NO DISTINCTLY SHAPEN GRIEVANCE THAT SHE COULD STATEEVEN TO HERSELF AND IN THE MIDST OF HER CONFUSED THOUGHT AND PASSIONTHE MENTAL ACT THAT WAS STRUGGLING FORTH INTO CLEARNESS WAS ASELFACCUSING CRY THAT HER FEELING OF DESOLATION WAS THE FAULT OF HEROWN SPIRITUAL POVERTY. SHE HAD MARRIED THE MAN OF HER CHOICE AND WITHTHE ADVANTAGE OVER MOST GIRLS THAT SHE HAD CONTEMPLATED HER MARRIAGECHIEFLY AS THE BEGINNING OF NEW DUTIES FROM THE VERY FIRST SHE HADTHOUGHT OF MR. CASAUBON AS HAVING A MIND SO MUCH ABOVE HER OWN THAT HEMUST OFTEN BE CLAIMED BY STUDIES WHICH SHE COULD NOT ENTIRELY SHAREMOREOVER AFTER THE BRIEF NARROW EXPERIENCE OF HER GIRLHOOD SHE WASBEHOLDING ROME THE CITY OF VISIBLE HISTORY WHERE THE PAST OF A WHOLEHEMISPHERE SEEMS MOVING IN FUNERAL PROCESSION WITH STRANGE ANCESTRALIMAGES AND TROPHIES GATHERED FROM AFAR.BUT THIS STUPENDOUS FRAGMENTARINESS HEIGHTENED THE DREAMLIKESTRANGENESS OF HER BRIDAL LIFE. DOROTHEA HAD NOW BEEN FIVE WEEKS INROME AND IN THE KINDLY MORNINGS WHEN AUTUMN AND WINTER SEEMED TO GOHAND IN HAND LIKE A HAPPY AGED COUPLE ONE OF WHOM WOULD PRESENTLYSURVIVE IN CHILLER LONELINESS SHE HAD DRIVEN ABOUT AT FIRST WITH MR.CASAUBON BUT OF LATE CHIEFLY WITH TANTRIPP AND THEIR EXPERIENCEDCOURIER. SHE HAD BEEN LED THROUGH THE BEST GALLERIES HAD BEEN TAKEN TOTHE CHIEF POINTS OF VIEW HAD BEEN SHOWN THE GRANDEST RUINS AND THEMOST GLORIOUS CHURCHES AND SHE HAD ENDED BY OFTENEST CHOOSING TO DRIVEOUT TO THE CAMPAGNA WHERE SHE COULD FEEL ALONE WITH THE EARTH AND SKYAWAYFROM THE OPPRESSIVE MASQUERADE OF AGES IN WHICH HER OWN LIFE TOOSEEMED TO BECOME A MASQUE WITH ENIGMATICAL COSTUMES.TO THOSE WHO HAVE LOOKED AT ROME WITH THE QUICKENING POWER OF AKNOWLEDGE WHICH BREATHES A GROWING SOUL INTO ALL HISTORIC SHAPES ANDTRACES OUT THE SUPPRESSED TRANSITIONS WHICH UNITE ALL CONTRASTS ROMEMAY STILL BE THE SPIRITUAL CENTRE AND INTERPRETER OF THE WORLD. BUT LETTHEM CONCEIVE ONE MORE HISTORICAL CONTRAST THE GIGANTIC BROKENREVELATIONS OF THAT IMPERIAL AND PAPAL CITY THRUST ABRUPTLY ON THENOTIONS OF A GIRL WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN ENGLISH AND SWISSPURITANISM FED ON MEAGRE PROTESTANT HISTORIES AND ON ART CHIEFLY OFTHE HANDSCREEN SORT A GIRL WHOSE ARDENT NATURE TURNED ALL HER SMALLALLOWANCE OF KNOWLEDGE INTO PRINCIPLES FUSING HER ACTIONS INTO THEIRMOULD AND WHOSE QUICK EMOTIONS GAVE THE MOST ABSTRACT THINGS THEQUALITY OF A PLEASURE OR A PAIN A GIRL WHO HAD LATELY BECOME A WIFEAND FROM THE ENTHUSIASTIC ACCEPTANCE OF UNTRIED DUTY FOUND HERSELFPLUNGED IN TUMULTUOUS PREOCCUPATION WITH HER PERSONAL LOT. THE WEIGHTOF UNINTELLIGIBLE ROME MIGHT LIE EASILY ON BRIGHT NYMPHS TO WHOM ITFORMED A BACKGROUND FOR THE BRILLIANT PICNIC OF ANGLOFOREIGN SOCIETYBUT DOROTHEA HAD NO SUCH DEFENCE AGAINST DEEP IMPRESSIONS. RUINS ANDBASILICAS PALACES AND COLOSSI SET IN THE MIDST OF A SORDID PRESENTWHERE ALL THAT WAS LIVING AND WARMBLOODED SEEMED SUNK IN THE DEEPDEGENERACY OF A SUPERSTITION DIVORCED FROM REVERENCE THE DIMMER BUTYET EAGER TITANIC LIFE GAZING AND STRUGGLING ON WALLS AND CEILINGS THELONG VISTAS OF WHITE FORMS WHOSE MARBLE EYES SEEMED TO HOLD THEMONOTONOUS LIGHT OF AN ALIEN WORLD ALL THIS VAST WRECK OF AMBITIOUSIDEALS SENSUOUS AND SPIRITUAL MIXED CONFUSEDLY WITH THE SIGNS OFBREATHING FORGETFULNESS AND DEGRADATION AT FIRST JARRED HER AS WITH ANELECTRIC SHOCK AND THEN URGED THEMSELVES ON HER WITH THAT ACHEBELONGING TO A GLUT OF CONFUSED IDEAS WHICH CHECK THE FLOW OF EMOTION.FORMS BOTH PALE AND GLOWING TOOK POSSESSION OF HER YOUNG SENSE ANDFIXED THEMSELVES IN HER MEMORY EVEN WHEN SHE WAS NOT THINKING OF THEMPREPARING STRANGE ASSOCIATIONS WHICH REMAINED THROUGH HER AFTERYEARS.OUR MOODS ARE APT TO BRING WITH THEM IMAGES WHICH SUCCEED EACH OTHERLIKE THE MAGICLANTERN PICTURES OF A DOZE AND IN CERTAIN STATES OFDULL FORLORNNESS DOROTHEA ALL HER LIFE CONTINUED TO SEE THE VASTNESS OFST. PETERS THE HUGE BRONZE CANOPY THE EXCITED INTENTION IN THEATTITUDES AND GARMENTS OF THE PROPHETS AND EVANGELISTS IN THE MOSAICSABOVE AND THE RED DRAPERY WHICH WAS BEING HUNG FOR CHRISTMAS SPREADINGITSELF EVERYWHERE LIKE A DISEASE OF THE RETINA.NOT THAT THIS INWARD AMAZEMENT OF DOROTHEAS WAS ANYTHING VERYEXCEPTIONAL MANY SOULS IN THEIR YOUNG NUDITY ARE TUMBLED OUT AMONGINCONGRUITIES AND LEFT TO FIND THEIR FEET AMONG THEM WHILE THEIRELDERS GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS. NOR CAN I SUPPOSE THAT WHEN MRS.CASAUBON IS DISCOVERED IN A FIT OF WEEPING SIX WEEKS AFTER HER WEDDINGTHE SITUATION WILL BE REGARDED AS TRAGIC. SOME DISCOURAGEMENT SOMEFAINTNESS OF HEART AT THE NEW REAL FUTURE WHICH REPLACES THE IMAGINARYIS NOT UNUSUAL AND WE DO NOT EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE DEEPLY MOVED BY WHATIS NOT UNUSUAL. THAT ELEMENT OF TRAGEDY WHICH LIES IN THE VERY FACT OFFREQUENCY HAS NOT YET WROUGHT ITSELF INTO THE COARSE EMOTION OFMANKIND AND PERHAPS OUR FRAMES COULD HARDLY BEAR MUCH OF IT. IF WE HADA KEEN VISION AND FEELING OF ALL ORDINARY HUMAN LIFE IT WOULD BE LIKEHEARING THE GRASS GROW AND THE SQUIRRELS HEART BEAT AND WE SHOULD DIEOF THAT ROAR WHICH LIES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF SILENCE. AS IT IS THEQUICKEST OF US WALK ABOUT WELL WADDED WITH STUPIDITY.HOWEVER DOROTHEA WAS CRYING AND IF SHE HAD BEEN REQUIRED TO STATE THECAUSE SHE COULD ONLY HAVE DONE SO IN SOME SUCH GENERAL WORDS AS I HAVEALREADY USED TO HAVE BEEN DRIVEN TO BE MORE PARTICULAR WOULD HAVE BEENLIKE TRYING TO GIVE A HISTORY OF THE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS FOR THAT NEWREAL FUTURE WHICH WAS REPLACING THE IMAGINARY DREW ITS MATERIAL FROMTHE ENDLESS MINUTIAE BY WHICH HER VIEW OF MR. CASAUBON AND HER WIFELYRELATION NOW THAT SHE WAS MARRIED TO HIM WAS GRADUALLY CHANGING WITHTHE SECRET MOTION OF A WATCHHAND FROM WHAT IT HAD BEEN IN HER MAIDENDREAM. IT WAS TOO EARLY YET FOR HER FULLY TO RECOGNIZE OR AT LEASTADMIT THE CHANGE STILL MORE FOR HER TO HAVE READJUSTED THATDEVOTEDNESS WHICH WAS SO NECESSARY A PART OF HER MENTAL LIFE THAT SHEWAS ALMOST SURE SOONER OR LATER TO RECOVER IT. PERMANENT REBELLION THEDISORDER OF A LIFE WITHOUT SOME LOVING REVERENT RESOLVE WAS NOTPOSSIBLE TO HER BUT SHE WAS NOW IN AN INTERVAL WHEN THE VERY FORCE OFHER NATURE HEIGHTENED ITS CONFUSION. IN THIS WAY THE EARLY MONTHS OFMARRIAGE OFTEN ARE TIMES OF CRITICAL TUMULTWHETHER THAT OF ASHRIMPPOOL OR OF DEEPER WATERSWHICH AFTERWARDS SUBSIDES INTO CHEERFULPEACE.BUT WAS NOT MR. CASAUBON JUST AS LEARNED AS BEFORE HAD HIS FORMS OFEXPRESSION CHANGED OR HIS SENTIMENTS BECOME LESS LAUDABLE OHWAYWARDNESS OF WOMANHOOD DID HIS CHRONOLOGY FAIL HIM OR HIS ABILITYTO STATE NOT ONLY A THEORY BUT THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO HELD IT OR HISPROVISION FOR GIVING THE HEADS OF ANY SUBJECT ON DEMAND AND WAS NOTROME THE PLACE IN ALL THE WORLD TO GIVE FREE PLAY TO SUCHACCOMPLISHMENTS BESIDES HAD NOT DOROTHEAS ENTHUSIASM ESPECIALLYDWELT ON THE PROSPECT OF RELIEVING THE WEIGHT AND PERHAPS THE SADNESSWITH WHICH GREAT TASKS LIE ON HIM WHO HAS TO ACHIEVE THEM AND THATSUCH WEIGHT PRESSED ON MR. CASAUBON WAS ONLY PLAINER THAN BEFORE.ALL THESE ARE CRUSHING QUESTIONS BUT WHATEVER ELSE REMAINED THE SAMETHE LIGHT HAD CHANGED AND YOU CANNOT FIND THE PEARLY DAWN AT NOONDAY.THE FACT IS UNALTERABLE THAT A FELLOWMORTAL WITH WHOSE NATURE YOU AREACQUAINTED SOLELY THROUGH THE BRIEF ENTRANCES AND EXITS OF A FEWIMAGINATIVE WEEKS CALLED COURTSHIP MAY WHEN SEEN IN THE CONTINUITY OFMARRIED COMPANIONSHIP BE DISCLOSED AS SOMETHING BETTER OR WORSE THANWHAT YOU HAVE PRECONCEIVED BUT WILL CERTAINLY NOT APPEAR ALTOGETHERTHE SAME. AND IT WOULD BE ASTONISHING TO FIND HOW SOON THE CHANGE ISFELT IF WE HAD NO KINDRED CHANGES TO COMPARE WITH IT. TO SHARE LODGINGSWITH A BRILLIANT DINNERCOMPANION OR TO SEE YOUR FAVORITE POLITICIANIN THE MINISTRY MAY BRING ABOUT CHANGES QUITE AS RAPID IN THESE CASESTOO WE BEGIN BY KNOWING LITTLE AND BELIEVING MUCH AND WE SOMETIMES ENDBY INVERTING THE QUANTITIES.STILL SUCH COMPARISONS MIGHT MISLEAD FOR NO MAN WAS MORE INCAPABLE OFFLASHY MAKEBELIEVE THAN MR. CASAUBON HE WAS AS GENUINE A CHARACTER ASANY RUMINANT ANIMAL AND HE HAD NOT ACTIVELY ASSISTED IN CREATING ANYILLUSIONS ABOUT HIMSELF. HOW WAS IT THAT IN THE WEEKS SINCE HERMARRIAGE DOROTHEA HAD NOT DISTINCTLY OBSERVED BUT FELT WITH A STIFLINGDEPRESSION THAT THE LARGE VISTAS AND WIDE FRESH AIR WHICH SHE HADDREAMED OF FINDING IN HER HUSBANDS MIND WERE REPLACED BY ANTEROOMS ANDWINDING PASSAGES WHICH SEEMED TO LEAD NOWHITHER I SUPPOSE IT WAS THATIN COURTSHIP EVERYTHING IS REGARDED AS PROVISIONAL AND PRELIMINARY ANDTHE SMALLEST SAMPLE OF VIRTUE OR ACCOMPLISHMENT IS TAKEN TO GUARANTEEDELIGHTFUL STORES WHICH THE BROAD LEISURE OF MARRIAGE WILL REVEAL. BUTTHE DOORSILL OF MARRIAGE ONCE CROSSED EXPECTATION IS CONCENTRATED ONTHE PRESENT. HAVING ONCE EMBARKED ON YOUR MARITAL VOYAGE IT ISIMPOSSIBLE NOT TO BE AWARE THAT YOU MAKE NO WAY AND THAT THE SEA IS NOTWITHIN SIGHTTHAT IN FACT YOU ARE EXPLORING AN ENCLOSED BASIN.IN THEIR CONVERSATION BEFORE MARRIAGE MR. CASAUBON HAD OFTEN DWELT ONSOME EXPLANATION OR QUESTIONABLE DETAIL OF WHICH DOROTHEA DID NOT SEETHE BEARING BUT SUCH IMPERFECT COHERENCE SEEMED DUE TO THE BROKENNESSOF THEIR INTERCOURSE AND SUPPORTED BY HER FAITH IN THEIR FUTURE SHEHAD LISTENED WITH FERVID PATIENCE TO A RECITATION OF POSSIBLE ARGUMENTSTO BE BROUGHT AGAINST MR. CASAUBONS ENTIRELY NEW VIEW OF THEPHILISTINE GOD DAGON AND OTHER FISHDEITIES THINKING THAT HEREAFTERSHE SHOULD SEE THIS SUBJECT WHICH TOUCHED HIM SO NEARLY FROM THE SAMEHIGH GROUND WHENCE DOUBTLESS IT HAD BECOME SO IMPORTANT TO HIM. AGAINTHE MATTEROFCOURSE STATEMENT AND TONE OF DISMISSAL WITH WHICH HETREATED WHAT TO HER WERE THE MOST STIRRING THOUGHTS WAS EASILYACCOUNTED FOR AS BELONGING TO THE SENSE OF HASTE AND PREOCCUPATION INWHICH SHE HERSELF SHARED DURING THEIR ENGAGEMENT. BUT NOW SINCE THEYHAD BEEN IN ROME WITH ALL THE DEPTHS OF HER EMOTION ROUSED TOTUMULTUOUS ACTIVITY AND WITH LIFE MADE A NEW PROBLEM BY NEW ELEMENTSSHE HAD BEEN BECOMING MORE AND MORE AWARE WITH A CERTAIN TERROR THATHER MIND WAS CONTINUALLY SLIDING INTO INWARD FITS OF ANGER ANDREPULSION OR ELSE INTO FORLORN WEARINESS. HOW FAR THE JUDICIOUS HOOKEROR ANY OTHER HERO OF ERUDITION WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME AT MR.CASAUBONS TIME OF LIFE SHE HAD NO MEANS OF KNOWING SO THAT HE COULDNOT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF COMPARISON BUT HER HUSBANDS WAY OFCOMMENTING ON THE STRANGELY IMPRESSIVE OBJECTS AROUND THEM HAD BEGUN TOAFFECT HER WITH A SORT OF MENTAL SHIVER HE HAD PERHAPS THE BESTINTENTION OF ACQUITTING HIMSELF WORTHILY BUT ONLY OF ACQUITTINGHIMSELF. WHAT WAS FRESH TO HER MIND WAS WORN OUT TO HIS AND SUCHCAPACITY OF THOUGHT AND FEELING AS HAD EVER BEEN STIMULATED IN HIM BYTHE GENERAL LIFE OF MANKIND HAD LONG SHRUNK TO A SORT OF DRIEDPREPARATION A LIFELESS EMBALMMENT OF KNOWLEDGE.WHEN HE SAID DOES THIS INTEREST YOU DOROTHEA SHALL WE STAY A LITTLELONGER I AM READY TO STAY IF YOU WISH ITIT SEEMED TO HER AS IFGOING OR STAYING WERE ALIKE DREARY. OR SHOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO THEFARNESINA DOROTHEA IT CONTAINS CELEBRATED FRESCOS DESIGNED OR PAINTEDBY RAPHAEL WHICH MOST PERSONS THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO VISIT.BUT DO YOU CARE ABOUT THEM WAS ALWAYS DOROTHEAS QUESTION.THEY ARE I BELIEVE HIGHLY ESTEEMED. SOME OF THEM REPRESENT THE FABLEOF CUPID AND PSYCHE WHICH IS PROBABLY THE ROMANTIC INVENTION OF ALITERARY PERIOD AND CANNOT I THINK BE RECKONED AS A GENUINE MYTHICALPRODUCT. BUT IF YOU LIKE THESE WALLPAINTINGS WE CAN EASILY DRIVETHITHER AND YOU WILL THEN I THINK HAVE SEEN THE CHIEF WORKS OFRAPHAEL ANY OF WHICH IT WERE A PITY TO OMIT IN A VISIT TO ROME. HE ISTHE PAINTER WHO HAS BEEN HELD TO COMBINE THE MOST COMPLETE GRACE OFFORM WITH SUBLIMITY OF EXPRESSION. SUCH AT LEAST I HAVE GATHERED TO BETHE OPINION OF COGNOSCENTI.THIS KIND OF ANSWER GIVEN IN A MEASURED OFFICIAL TONE AS OF ACLERGYMAN READING ACCORDING TO THE RUBRIC DID NOT HELP TO JUSTIFY THEGLORIES OF THE ETERNAL CITY OR TO GIVE HER THE HOPE THAT IF SHE KNEWMORE ABOUT THEM THE WORLD WOULD BE JOYOUSLY ILLUMINATED FOR HER. THEREIS HARDLY ANY CONTACT MORE DEPRESSING TO A YOUNG ARDENT CREATURE THANTHAT OF A MIND IN WHICH YEARS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE SEEM TO HAVE ISSUED INA BLANK ABSENCE OF INTEREST OR SYMPATHY.ON OTHER SUBJECTS INDEED MR. CASAUBON SHOWED A TENACITY OF OCCUPATIONAND AN EAGERNESS WHICH ARE USUALLY REGARDED AS THE EFFECT OFENTHUSIASM AND DOROTHEA WAS ANXIOUS TO FOLLOW THIS SPONTANEOUSDIRECTION OF HIS THOUGHTS INSTEAD OF BEING MADE TO FEEL THAT SHEDRAGGED HIM AWAY FROM IT. BUT SHE WAS GRADUALLY CEASING TO EXPECT WITHHER FORMER DELIGHTFUL CONFIDENCE THAT SHE SHOULD SEE ANY WIDE OPENINGWHERE SHE FOLLOWED HIM. POOR MR. CASAUBON HIMSELF WAS LOST AMONG SMALLCLOSETS AND WINDING STAIRS AND IN AN AGITATED DIMNESS ABOUT THECABEIRI OR IN AN EXPOSURE OF OTHER MYTHOLOGISTS ILLCONSIDEREDPARALLELS EASILY LOST SIGHT OF ANY PURPOSE WHICH HAD PROMPTED HIM TOTHESE LABORS. WITH HIS TAPER STUCK BEFORE HIM HE FORGOT THE ABSENCE OFWINDOWS AND IN BITTER MANUSCRIPT REMARKS ON OTHER MENS NOTIONS ABOUTTHE SOLAR DEITIES HE HAD BECOME INDIFFERENT TO THE SUNLIGHT.THESE CHARACTERISTICS FIXED AND UNCHANGEABLE AS BONE IN MR. CASAUBONMIGHT HAVE REMAINED LONGER UNFELT BY DOROTHEA IF SHE HAD BEENENCOURAGED TO POUR FORTH HER GIRLISH AND WOMANLY FEELINGIF HE WOULDHAVE HELD HER HANDS BETWEEN HIS AND LISTENED WITH THE DELIGHT OFTENDERNESS AND UNDERSTANDING TO ALL THE LITTLE HISTORIES WHICH MADE UPHER EXPERIENCE AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN HER THE SAME SORT OF INTIMACY INRETURN SO THAT THE PAST LIFE OF EACH COULD BE INCLUDED IN THEIR MUTUALKNOWLEDGE AND AFFECTIONOR IF SHE COULD HAVE FED HER AFFECTION WITHTHOSE CHILDLIKE CARESSES WHICH ARE THE BENT OF EVERY SWEET WOMAN WHOHAS BEGUN BY SHOWERING KISSES ON THE HARD PATE OF HER BALD DOLLCREATING A HAPPY SOUL WITHIN THAT WOODENNESS FROM THE WEALTH OF HER OWNLOVE. THAT WAS DOROTHEAS BENT. WITH ALL HER YEARNING TO KNOW WHAT WASAFAR FROM HER AND TO BE WIDELY BENIGNANT SHE HAD ARDOR ENOUGH FOR WHATWAS NEAR TO HAVE KISSED MR. CASAUBONS COATSLEEVE OR TO HAVECARESSED HIS SHOELATCHET IF HE WOULD HAVE MADE ANY OTHER SIGN OFACCEPTANCE THAN PRONOUNCING HER WITH HIS UNFAILING PROPRIETY TO BE OFA MOST AFFECTIONATE AND TRULY FEMININE NATURE INDICATING AT THE SAMETIME BY POLITELY REACHING A CHAIR FOR HER THAT HE REGARDED THESEMANIFESTATIONS AS RATHER CRUDE AND STARTLING. HAVING MADE HIS CLERICALTOILET WITH DUE CARE IN THE MORNING HE WAS PREPARED ONLY FOR THOSEAMENITIES OF LIFE WHICH WERE SUITED TO THE WELLADJUSTED STIFF CRAVATOF THE PERIOD AND TO A MIND WEIGHTED WITH UNPUBLISHED MATTER.AND BY A SAD CONTRADICTION DOROTHEAS IDEAS AND RESOLVES SEEMED LIKEMELTING ICE FLOATING AND LOST IN THE WARM FLOOD OF WHICH THEY HAD BEENBUT ANOTHER FORM. SHE WAS HUMILIATED TO FIND HERSELF A MERE VICTIM OFFEELING AS IF SHE COULD KNOW NOTHING EXCEPT THROUGH THAT MEDIUM ALLHER STRENGTH WAS SCATTERED IN FITS OF AGITATION OF STRUGGLE OFDESPONDENCY AND THEN AGAIN IN VISIONS OF MORE COMPLETE RENUNCIATIONTRANSFORMING ALL HARD CONDITIONS INTO DUTY. POOR DOROTHEA SHE WASCERTAINLY TROUBLESOMETO HERSELF CHIEFLY BUT THIS MORNING FOR THEFIRST TIME SHE HAD BEEN TROUBLESOME TO MR. CASAUBON.SHE HAD BEGUN WHILE THEY WERE TAKING COFFEE WITH A DETERMINATION TOSHAKE OFF WHAT SHE INWARDLY CALLED HER SELFISHNESS AND TURNED A FACEALL CHEERFUL ATTENTION TO HER HUSBAND WHEN HE SAID MY DEAR DOROTHEAWE MUST NOW THINK OF ALL THAT IS YET LEFT UNDONE AS A PRELIMINARY TOOUR DEPARTURE. I WOULD FAIN HAVE RETURNED HOME EARLIER THAT WE MIGHTHAVE BEEN AT LOWICK FOR THE CHRISTMAS BUT MY INQUIRIES HERE HAVE BEENPROTRACTED BEYOND THEIR ANTICIPATED PERIOD. I TRUST HOWEVER THAT THETIME HERE HAS NOT BEEN PASSED UNPLEASANTLY TO YOU. AMONG THE SIGHTS OFEUROPE THAT OF ROME HAS EVER BEEN HELD ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING AND INSOME RESPECTS EDIFYING. I WELL REMEMBER THAT I CONSIDERED IT AN EPOCHIN MY LIFE WHEN I VISITED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER THE FALL OFNAPOLEON AN EVENT WHICH OPENED THE CONTINENT TO TRAVELLERS. INDEED ITHINK IT IS ONE AMONG SEVERAL CITIES TO WHICH AN EXTREME HYPERBOLE HASBEEN APPLIEDSEE ROME AND DIE BUT IN YOUR CASE I WOULD PROPOSE ANEMENDATION AND SAY SEE ROME AS A BRIDE AND LIVE HENCEFORTH AS A HAPPYWIFE.MR. CASAUBON PRONOUNCED THIS LITTLE SPEECH WITH THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUSINTENTION BLINKING A LITTLE AND SWAYING HIS HEAD UP AND DOWN ANDCONCLUDING WITH A SMILE. HE HAD NOT FOUND MARRIAGE A RAPTUROUS STATEBUT HE HAD NO IDEA OF BEING ANYTHING ELSE THAN AN IRREPROACHABLEHUSBAND WHO WOULD MAKE A CHARMING YOUNG WOMAN AS HAPPY AS SHE DESERVEDTO BE.I HOPE YOU ARE THOROUGHLY SATISFIED WITH OUR STAYI MEAN WITH THERESULT SO FAR AS YOUR STUDIES ARE CONCERNED SAID DOROTHEA TRYING TOKEEP HER MIND FIXED ON WHAT MOST AFFECTED HER HUSBAND.YES SAID MR. CASAUBON WITH THAT PECULIAR PITCH OF VOICE WHICH MAKESTHE WORD HALF A NEGATIVE. I HAVE BEEN LED FARTHER THAN I HAD FORESEENAND VARIOUS SUBJECTS FOR ANNOTATION HAVE PRESENTED THEMSELVES WHICHTHOUGH I HAVE NO DIRECT NEED OF THEM I COULD NOT PRETERMIT. THE TASKNOTWITHSTANDING THE ASSISTANCE OF MY AMANUENSIS HAS BEEN A SOMEWHATLABORIOUS ONE BUT YOUR SOCIETY HAS HAPPILY PREVENTED ME FROM THAT TOOCONTINUOUS PROSECUTION OF THOUGHT BEYOND THE HOURS OF STUDY WHICH HASBEEN THE SNARE OF MY SOLITARY LIFE.I AM VERY GLAD THAT MY PRESENCE HAS MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO YOU SAIDDOROTHEA WHO HAD A VIVID MEMORY OF EVENINGS IN WHICH SHE HAD SUPPOSEDTHAT MR. CASAUBONS MIND HAD GONE TOO DEEP DURING THE DAY TO BE ABLE TOGET TO THE SURFACE AGAIN. I FEAR THERE WAS A LITTLE TEMPER IN HERREPLY. I HOPE WHEN WE GET TO LOWICK I SHALL BE MORE USEFUL TO YOUAND BE ABLE TO ENTER A LITTLE MORE INTO WHAT INTERESTS YOU.DOUBTLESS MY DEAR SAID MR. CASAUBON WITH A SLIGHT BOW. THE NOTESI HAVE HERE MADE WILL WANT SIFTING AND YOU CAN IF YOU PLEASE EXTRACTTHEM UNDER MY DIRECTION.AND ALL YOUR NOTES SAID DOROTHEA WHOSE HEART HAD ALREADY BURNEDWITHIN HER ON THIS SUBJECT SO THAT NOW SHE COULD NOT HELP SPEAKINGWITH HER TONGUE. ALL THOSE ROWS OF VOLUMESWILL YOU NOT NOW DO WHATYOU USED TO SPEAK OFWILL YOU NOT MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHAT PART OF THEMYOU WILL USE AND BEGIN TO WRITE THE BOOK WHICH WILL MAKE YOUR VASTKNOWLEDGE USEFUL TO THE WORLD I WILL WRITE TO YOUR DICTATION OR IWILL COPY AND EXTRACT WHAT YOU TELL ME I CAN BE OF NO OTHER USE.DOROTHEA IN A MOST UNACCOUNTABLE DARKLY FEMININE MANNER ENDED WITH ASLIGHT SOB AND EYES FULL OF TEARS.THE EXCESSIVE FEELING MANIFESTED WOULD ALONE HAVE BEEN HIGHLYDISTURBING TO MR. CASAUBON BUT THERE WERE OTHER REASONS WHY DOROTHEASWORDS WERE AMONG THE MOST CUTTING AND IRRITATING TO HIM THAT SHE COULDHAVE BEEN IMPELLED TO USE. SHE WAS AS BLIND TO HIS INWARD TROUBLES ASHE TO HERS SHE HAD NOT YET LEARNED THOSE HIDDEN CONFLICTS IN HERHUSBAND WHICH CLAIM OUR PITY. SHE HAD NOT YET LISTENED PATIENTLY TO HISHEARTBEATS BUT ONLY FELT THAT HER OWN WAS BEATING VIOLENTLY. IN MR.CASAUBONS EAR DOROTHEAS VOICE GAVE LOUD EMPHATIC ITERATION TO THOSEMUFFLED SUGGESTIONS OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH IT WAS POSSIBLE TO EXPLAINAS MERE FANCY THE ILLUSION OF EXAGGERATED SENSITIVENESS ALWAYS WHENSUCH SUGGESTIONS ARE UNMISTAKABLY REPEATED FROM WITHOUT THEY ARERESISTED AS CRUEL AND UNJUST. WE ARE ANGERED EVEN BY THE FULLACCEPTANCE OF OUR HUMILIATING CONFESSIONSHOW MUCH MORE BY HEARING INHARD DISTINCT SYLLABLES FROM THE LIPS OF A NEAR OBSERVER THOSECONFUSED MURMURS WHICH WE TRY TO CALL MORBID AND STRIVE AGAINST AS IFTHEY WERE THE ONCOMING OF NUMBNESS AND THIS CRUEL OUTWARD ACCUSER WASTHERE IN THE SHAPE OF A WIFENAY OF A YOUNG BRIDE WHO INSTEAD OFOBSERVING HIS ABUNDANT PENSCRATCHES AND AMPLITUDE OF PAPER WITH THEUNCRITICAL AWE OF AN ELEGANTMINDED CANARYBIRD SEEMED TO PRESENTHERSELF AS A SPY WATCHING EVERYTHING WITH A MALIGN POWER OF INFERENCE.HERE TOWARDS THIS PARTICULAR POINT OF THE COMPASS MR. CASAUBON HAD ASENSITIVENESS TO MATCH DOROTHEAS AND AN EQUAL QUICKNESS TO IMAGINEMORE THAN THE FACT. HE HAD FORMERLY OBSERVED WITH APPROBATION HERCAPACITY FOR WORSHIPPING THE RIGHT OBJECT HE NOW FORESAW WITH SUDDENTERROR THAT THIS CAPACITY MIGHT BE REPLACED BY PRESUMPTION THISWORSHIP BY THE MOST EXASPERATING OF ALL CRITICISMTHAT WHICH SEESVAGUELY A GREAT MANY FINE ENDS AND HAS NOT THE LEAST NOTION WHAT ITCOSTS TO REACH THEM.FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE DOROTHEA HAD KNOWN HIM MR. CASAUBONS FACEHAD A QUICK ANGRY FLUSH UPON IT.MY LOVE HE SAID WITH IRRITATION REINED IN BY PROPRIETY YOU MAYRELY UPON ME FOR KNOWING THE TIMES AND THE SEASONS ADAPTED TO THEDIFFERENT STAGES OF A WORK WHICH IS NOT TO BE MEASURED BY THE FACILECONJECTURES OF IGNORANT ONLOOKERS. IT HAD BEEN EASY FOR ME TO GAIN ATEMPORARY EFFECT BY A MIRAGE OF BASELESS OPINION BUT IT IS EVER THETRIAL OF THE SCRUPULOUS EXPLORER TO BE SALUTED WITH THE IMPATIENT SCORNOF CHATTERERS WHO ATTEMPT ONLY THE SMALLEST ACHIEVEMENTS BEING INDEEDEQUIPPED FOR NO OTHER. AND IT WERE WELL IF ALL SUCH COULD BE ADMONISHEDTO DISCRIMINATE JUDGMENTS OF WHICH THE TRUE SUBJECTMATTER LIESENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR REACH FROM THOSE OF WHICH THE ELEMENTS MAY BECOMPASSED BY A NARROW AND SUPERFICIAL SURVEY.THIS SPEECH WAS DELIVERED WITH AN ENERGY AND READINESS QUITE UNUSUALWITH MR. CASAUBON. IT WAS NOT INDEED ENTIRELY AN IMPROVISATION BUT HADTAKEN SHAPE IN INWARD COLLOQUY AND RUSHED OUT LIKE THE ROUND GRAINSFROM A FRUIT WHEN SUDDEN HEAT CRACKS IT. DOROTHEA WAS NOT ONLY HISWIFE SHE WAS A PERSONIFICATION OF THAT SHALLOW WORLD WHICH SURROUNDSTHE APPRECIATED OR DESPONDING AUTHOR.DOROTHEA WAS INDIGNANT IN HER TURN. HAD SHE NOT BEEN REPRESSINGEVERYTHING IN HERSELF EXCEPT THE DESIRE TO ENTER INTO SOME FELLOWSHIPWITH HER HUSBANDS CHIEF INTERESTSMY JUDGMENT WAS A VERY SUPERFICIAL ONESUCH AS I AM CAPABLE OFFORMING SHE ANSWERED WITH A PROMPT RESENTMENT THAT NEEDED NOREHEARSAL. YOU SHOWED ME THE ROWS OF NOTEBOOKSYOU HAVE OFTEN SPOKENOF THEMYOU HAVE OFTEN SAID THAT THEY WANTED DIGESTING. BUT I NEVERHEARD YOU SPEAK OF THE WRITING THAT IS TO BE PUBLISHED. THOSE WERE VERYSIMPLE FACTS AND MY JUDGMENT WENT NO FARTHER. I ONLY BEGGED YOU TO LETME BE OF SOME GOOD TO YOU.DOROTHEA ROSE TO LEAVE THE TABLE AND MR. CASAUBON MADE NO REPLY TAKINGUP A LETTER WHICH LAY BESIDE HIM AS IF TO REPERUSE IT. BOTH WERESHOCKED AT THEIR MUTUAL SITUATIONTHAT EACH SHOULD HAVE BETRAYED ANGERTOWARDS THE OTHER. IF THEY HAD BEEN AT HOME SETTLED AT LOWICK INORDINARY LIFE AMONG THEIR NEIGHBORS THE CLASH WOULD HAVE BEEN LESSEMBARRASSING BUT ON A WEDDING JOURNEY THE EXPRESS OBJECT OF WHICH ISTO ISOLATE TWO PEOPLE ON THE GROUND THAT THEY ARE ALL THE WORLD TO EACHOTHER THE SENSE OF DISAGREEMENT IS TO SAY THE LEAST CONFOUNDING ANDSTULTIFYING. TO HAVE CHANGED YOUR LONGITUDE EXTENSIVELY AND PLACEDYOURSELVES IN A MORAL SOLITUDE IN ORDER TO HAVE SMALL EXPLOSIONS TOFIND CONVERSATION DIFFICULT AND TO HAND A GLASS OF WATER WITHOUTLOOKING CAN HARDLY BE REGARDED AS SATISFACTORY FULFILMENT EVEN TO THETOUGHEST MINDS. TO DOROTHEAS INEXPERIENCED SENSITIVENESS IT SEEMEDLIKE A CATASTROPHE CHANGING ALL PROSPECTS AND TO MR. CASAUBON IT WASA NEW PAIN HE NEVER HAVING BEEN ON A WEDDING JOURNEY BEFORE OR FOUNDHIMSELF IN THAT CLOSE UNION WHICH WAS MORE OF A SUBJECTION THAN HE HADBEEN ABLE TO IMAGINE SINCE THIS CHARMING YOUNG BRIDE NOT ONLY OBLIGEDHIM TO MUCH CONSIDERATION ON HER BEHALF WHICH HE HAD SEDULOUSLYGIVEN BUT TURNED OUT TO BE CAPABLE OF AGITATING HIM CRUELLY JUSTWHERE HE MOST NEEDED SOOTHING. INSTEAD OF GETTING A SOFT FENCE AGAINSTTHE COLD SHADOWY UNAPPLAUSIVE AUDIENCE OF HIS LIFE HAD HE ONLY GIVENIT A MORE SUBSTANTIAL PRESENCENEITHER OF THEM FELT IT POSSIBLE TO SPEAK AGAIN AT PRESENT. TO HAVEREVERSED A PREVIOUS ARRANGEMENT AND DECLINED TO GO OUT WOULD HAVE BEENA SHOW OF PERSISTENT ANGER WHICH DOROTHEAS CONSCIENCE SHRANK FROMSEEING THAT SHE ALREADY BEGAN TO FEEL HERSELF GUILTY. HOWEVER JUST HERINDIGNATION MIGHT BE HER IDEAL WAS NOT TO CLAIM JUSTICE BUT TO GIVETENDERNESS. SO WHEN THE CARRIAGE CAME TO THE DOOR SHE DROVE WITH MR.CASAUBON TO THE VATICAN WALKED WITH HIM THROUGH THE STONY AVENUE OFINSCRIPTIONS AND WHEN SHE PARTED WITH HIM AT THE ENTRANCE TO THELIBRARY WENT ON THROUGH THE MUSEUM OUT OF MERE LISTLESSNESS AS TO WHATWAS AROUND HER. SHE HAD NOT SPIRIT TO TURN ROUND AND SAY THAT SHE WOULDDRIVE ANYWHERE. IT WAS WHEN MR. CASAUBON WAS QUITTING HER THAT NAUMANNHAD FIRST SEEN HER AND HE HAD ENTERED THE LONG GALLERY OF SCULPTURE ATTHE SAME TIME WITH HER BUT HERE NAUMANN HAD TO AWAIT LADISLAW WITHWHOM HE WAS TO SETTLE A BET OF CHAMPAGNE ABOUT AN ENIGMATICALMEDIAEVALLOOKING FIGURE THERE. AFTER THEY HAD EXAMINED THE FIGURE ANDHAD WALKED ON FINISHING THEIR DISPUTE THEY HAD PARTED LADISLAWLINGERING BEHIND WHILE NAUMANN HAD GONE INTO THE HALL OF STATUES WHEREHE AGAIN SAW DOROTHEA AND SAW HER IN THAT BROODING ABSTRACTION WHICHMADE HER POSE REMARKABLE. SHE DID NOT REALLY SEE THE STREAK OF SUNLIGHTON THE FLOOR MORE THAN SHE SAW THE STATUES SHE WAS INWARDLY SEEING THELIGHT OF YEARS TO COME IN HER OWN HOME AND OVER THE ENGLISH FIELDS ANDELMS AND HEDGEBORDERED HIGHROADS AND FEELING THAT THE WAY IN WHICHTHEY MIGHT BE FILLED WITH JOYFUL DEVOTEDNESS WAS NOT SO CLEAR TO HER ASIT HAD BEEN. BUT IN DOROTHEAS MIND THERE WAS A CURRENT INTO WHICH ALLTHOUGHT AND FEELING WERE APT SOONER OR LATER TO FLOWTHE REACHINGFORWARD OF THE WHOLE CONSCIOUSNESS TOWARDS THE FULLEST TRUTH THE LEASTPARTIAL GOOD. THERE WAS CLEARLY SOMETHING BETTER THAN ANGER ANDDESPONDENCY.CHAPTER XXI.HIRE FACOUNDE EKE FULL WOMANLY AND PLAINNO CONTREFETED TERMES HAD SHETO SEMEN WISE.CHAUCER.IT WAS IN THAT WAY DOROTHEA CAME TO BE SOBBING AS SOON AS SHE WASSECURELY ALONE. BUT SHE WAS PRESENTLY ROUSED BY A KNOCK AT THE DOORWHICH MADE HER HASTILY DRY HER EYES BEFORE SAYING COME IN. TANTRIPPHAD BROUGHT A CARD AND SAID THAT THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN WAITING IN THELOBBY. THE COURIER HAD TOLD HIM THAT ONLY MRS. CASAUBON WAS AT HOMEBUT HE SAID HE WAS A RELATION OF MR. CASAUBONS WOULD SHE SEE HIMYES SAID DOROTHEA WITHOUT PAUSE SHOW HIM INTO THE SALON. HERCHIEF IMPRESSIONS ABOUT YOUNG LADISLAW WERE THAT WHEN SHE HAD SEEN HIMAT LOWICK SHE HAD BEEN MADE AWARE OF MR. CASAUBONS GENEROSITY TOWARDSHIM AND ALSO THAT SHE HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS OWN HESITATION ABOUTHIS CAREER. SHE WAS ALIVE TO ANYTHING THAT GAVE HER AN OPPORTUNITY FORACTIVE SYMPATHY AND AT THIS MOMENT IT SEEMED AS IF THE VISIT HAD COMETO SHAKE HER OUT OF HER SELFABSORBED DISCONTENTTO REMIND HER OF HERHUSBANDS GOODNESS AND MAKE HER FEEL THAT SHE HAD NOW THE RIGHT TO BEHIS HELPMATE IN ALL KIND DEEDS. SHE WAITED A MINUTE OR TWO BUT WHENSHE PASSED INTO THE NEXT ROOM THERE WERE JUST SIGNS ENOUGH THAT SHE HADBEEN CRYING TO MAKE HER OPEN FACE LOOK MORE YOUTHFUL AND APPEALING THANUSUAL. SHE MET LADISLAW WITH THAT EXQUISITE SMILE OF GOODWILL WHICH ISUNMIXED WITH VANITY AND HELD OUT HER HAND TO HIM. HE WAS THE ELDER BYSEVERAL YEARS BUT AT THAT MOMENT HE LOOKED MUCH THE YOUNGER FOR HISTRANSPARENT COMPLEXION FLUSHED SUDDENLY AND HE SPOKE WITH A SHYNESSEXTREMELY UNLIKE THE READY INDIFFERENCE OF HIS MANNER WITH HIS MALECOMPANION WHILE DOROTHEA BECAME ALL THE CALMER WITH A WONDERING DESIRETO PUT HIM AT EASE.I WAS NOT AWARE THAT YOU AND MR. CASAUBON WERE IN ROME UNTIL THISMORNING WHEN I SAW YOU IN THE VATICAN MUSEUM HE SAID. I KNEW YOU ATONCEBUTI MEAN THAT I CONCLUDED MR. CASAUBONS ADDRESS WOULD BE FOUNDAT THE POSTE RESTANTE AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO HIM ANDYOU AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE.PRAY SIT DOWN. HE IS NOT HERE NOW BUT HE WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR OF YOUI AM SURE SAID DOROTHEA SEATING HERSELF UNTHINKINGLY BETWEEN THEFIRE AND THE LIGHT OF THE TALL WINDOW AND POINTING TO A CHAIROPPOSITE WITH THE QUIETUDE OF A BENIGNANT MATRON. THE SIGNS OF GIRLISHSORROW IN HER FACE WERE ONLY THE MORE STRIKING. MR. CASAUBON IS MUCHENGAGED BUT YOU WILL LEAVE YOUR ADDRESSWILL YOU NOTAND HE WILLWRITE TO YOU.YOU ARE VERY GOOD SAID LADISLAW BEGINNING TO LOSE HIS DIFFIDENCE INTHE INTEREST WITH WHICH HE WAS OBSERVING THE SIGNS OF WEEPING WHICH HADALTERED HER FACE. MY ADDRESS IS ON MY CARD. BUT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME IWILL CALL AGAIN TOMORROW AT AN HOUR WHEN MR. CASAUBON IS LIKELY TO BEAT HOME.HE GOES TO READ IN THE LIBRARY OF THE VATICAN EVERY DAY AND YOU CANHARDLY SEE HIM EXCEPT BY AN APPOINTMENT. ESPECIALLY NOW. WE ARE ABOUTTO LEAVE ROME AND HE IS VERY BUSY. HE IS USUALLY AWAY ALMOST FROMBREAKFAST TILL DINNER. BUT I AM SURE HE WILL WISH YOU TO DINE WITH US.WILL LADISLAW WAS STRUCK MUTE FOR A FEW MOMENTS. HE HAD NEVER BEEN FONDOF MR. CASAUBON AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE SENSE OF OBLIGATIONWOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT HIM AS A BAT OF ERUDITION. BUT THE IDEA OF THISDRIEDUP PEDANT THIS ELABORATOR OF SMALL EXPLANATIONS ABOUT ASIMPORTANT AS THE SURPLUS STOCK OF FALSE ANTIQUITIES KEPT IN A VENDORSBACK CHAMBER HAVING FIRST GOT THIS ADORABLE YOUNG CREATURE TO MARRYHIM AND THEN PASSING HIS HONEYMOON AWAY FROM HER GROPING AFTER HISMOULDY FUTILITIES WILL WAS GIVEN TO HYPERBOLETHIS SUDDEN PICTURESTIRRED HIM WITH A SORT OF COMIC DISGUST HE WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN THEIMPULSE TO LAUGH ALOUD AND THE EQUALLY UNSEASONABLE IMPULSE TO BURSTINTO SCORNFUL INVECTIVE.FOR AN INSTANT HE FELT THAT THE STRUGGLE WAS CAUSING A QUEER CONTORTIONOF HIS MOBILE FEATURES BUT WITH A GOOD EFFORT HE RESOLVED IT INTONOTHING MORE OFFENSIVE THAN A MERRY SMILE.DOROTHEA WONDERED BUT THE SMILE WAS IRRESISTIBLE AND SHONE BACK FROMHER FACE TOO. WILL LADISLAWS SMILE WAS DELIGHTFUL UNLESS YOU WEREANGRY WITH HIM BEFOREHAND IT WAS A GUSH OF INWARD LIGHT ILLUMINATINGTHE TRANSPARENT SKIN AS WELL AS THE EYES AND PLAYING ABOUT EVERY CURVEAND LINE AS IF SOME ARIEL WERE TOUCHING THEM WITH A NEW CHARM ANDBANISHING FOREVER THE TRACES OF MOODINESS. THE REFLECTION OF THAT SMILECOULD NOT BUT HAVE A LITTLE MERRIMENT IN IT TOO EVEN UNDER DARKEYELASHES STILL MOIST AS DOROTHEA SAID INQUIRINGLY SOMETHING AMUSESYOUYES SAID WILL QUICK IN FINDING RESOURCES. I AM THINKING OF THESORT OF FIGURE I CUT THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU WHEN YOU ANNIHILATED MYPOOR SKETCH WITH YOUR CRITICISM.MY CRITICISM SAID DOROTHEA WONDERING STILL MORE. SURELY NOT. IALWAYS FEEL PARTICULARLY IGNORANT ABOUT PAINTING.I SUSPECTED YOU OF KNOWING SO MUCH THAT YOU KNEW HOW TO SAY JUST WHATWAS MOST CUTTING. YOU SAIDI DARE SAY YOU DONT REMEMBER IT AS IDOTHAT THE RELATION OF MY SKETCH TO NATURE WAS QUITE HIDDEN FROM YOU.AT LEAST YOU IMPLIED THAT. WILL COULD LAUGH NOW AS WELL AS SMILE.THAT WAS REALLY MY IGNORANCE SAID DOROTHEA ADMIRING WILLSGOODHUMOR. I MUST HAVE SAID SO ONLY BECAUSE I NEVER COULD SEE ANYBEAUTY IN THE PICTURES WHICH MY UNCLE TOLD ME ALL JUDGES THOUGHT VERYFINE. AND I HAVE GONE ABOUT WITH JUST THE SAME IGNORANCE IN ROME. THEREARE COMPARATIVELY FEW PAINTINGS THAT I CAN REALLY ENJOY. AT FIRST WHENI ENTER A ROOM WHERE THE WALLS ARE COVERED WITH FRESCOS OR WITH RAREPICTURES I FEEL A KIND OF AWELIKE A CHILD PRESENT AT GREAT CEREMONIESWHERE THERE ARE GRAND ROBES AND PROCESSIONS I FEEL MYSELF IN THEPRESENCE OF SOME HIGHER LIFE THAN MY OWN. BUT WHEN I BEGIN TO EXAMINETHE PICTURES ONE BY ONE THE LIFE GOES OUT OF THEM OR ELSE IS SOMETHINGVIOLENT AND STRANGE TO ME. IT MUST BE MY OWN DULNESS. I AM SEEING SOMUCH ALL AT ONCE AND NOT UNDERSTANDING HALF OF IT. THAT ALWAYS MAKESONE FEEL STUPID. IT IS PAINFUL TO BE TOLD THAT ANYTHING IS VERY FINEAND NOT BE ABLE TO FEEL THAT IT IS FINESOMETHING LIKE BEING BLINDWHILE PEOPLE TALK OF THE SKY.OH THERE IS A GREAT DEAL IN THE FEELING FOR ART WHICH MUST BEACQUIRED SAID WILL. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOW TO DOUBT THE DIRECTNESS OFDOROTHEAS CONFESSION. ART IS AN OLD LANGUAGE WITH A GREAT MANYARTIFICIAL AFFECTED STYLES AND SOMETIMES THE CHIEF PLEASURE ONE GETSOUT OF KNOWING THEM IS THE MERE SENSE OF KNOWING. I ENJOY THE ART OFALL SORTS HERE IMMENSELY BUT I SUPPOSE IF I COULD PICK MY ENJOYMENT TOPIECES I SHOULD FIND IT MADE UP OF MANY DIFFERENT THREADS. THERE ISSOMETHING IN DAUBING A LITTLE ONES SELF AND HAVING AN IDEA OF THEPROCESS.YOU MEAN PERHAPS TO BE A PAINTER SAID DOROTHEA WITH A NEW DIRECTIONOF INTEREST. YOU MEAN TO MAKE PAINTING YOUR PROFESSION MR. CASAUBONWILL LIKE TO HEAR THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN A PROFESSION.NO OH NO SAID WILL WITH SOME COLDNESS. I HAVE QUITE MADE UP MYMIND AGAINST IT. IT IS TOO ONESIDED A LIFE. I HAVE BEEN SEEING A GREATDEAL OF THE GERMAN ARTISTS HERE I TRAVELLED FROM FRANKFORT WITH ONE OFTHEM. SOME ARE FINE EVEN BRILLIANT FELLOWSBUT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TOGET INTO THEIR WAY OF LOOKING AT THE WORLD ENTIRELY FROM THE STUDIOPOINT OF VIEW.THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND SAID DOROTHEA CORDIALLY. AND IN ROME ITSEEMS AS IF THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS WHICH ARE MORE WANTED IN THEWORLD THAN PICTURES. BUT IF YOU HAVE A GENIUS FOR PAINTING WOULD ITNOT BE RIGHT TO TAKE THAT AS A GUIDE PERHAPS YOU MIGHT DO BETTERTHINGS THAN THESEOR DIFFERENT SO THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE SO MANYPICTURES ALMOST ALL ALIKE IN THE SAME PLACE.THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THIS SIMPLICITY AND WILL WAS WON BY IT INTOFRANKNESS. A MAN MUST HAVE A VERY RARE GENIUS TO MAKE CHANGES OF THATSORT. I AM AFRAID MINE WOULD NOT CARRY ME EVEN TO THE PITCH OF DOINGWELL WHAT HAS BEEN DONE ALREADY AT LEAST NOT SO WELL AS TO MAKE ITWORTH WHILE. AND I SHOULD NEVER SUCCEED IN ANYTHING BY DINT OFDRUDGERY. IF THINGS DONT COME EASILY TO ME I NEVER GET THEM.I HAVE HEARD MR. CASAUBON SAY THAT HE REGRETS YOUR WANT OF PATIENCESAID DOROTHEA GENTLY. SHE WAS RATHER SHOCKED AT THIS MODE OF TAKINGALL LIFE AS A HOLIDAY.YES I KNOW MR. CASAUBONS OPINION. HE AND I DIFFER.THE SLIGHT STREAK OF CONTEMPT IN THIS HASTY REPLY OFFENDED DOROTHEA.SHE WAS ALL THE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE ABOUT MR. CASAUBON BECAUSE OF HERMORNINGS TROUBLE.CERTAINLY YOU DIFFER SHE SAID RATHER PROUDLY. I DID NOT THINK OFCOMPARING YOU SUCH POWER OF PERSEVERING DEVOTED LABOR AS MR.CASAUBONS IS NOT COMMON.WILL SAW THAT SHE WAS OFFENDED BUT THIS ONLY GAVE AN ADDITIONALIMPULSE TO THE NEW IRRITATION OF HIS LATENT DISLIKE TOWARDS MR.CASAUBON. IT WAS TOO INTOLERABLE THAT DOROTHEA SHOULD BE WORSHIPPINGTHIS HUSBAND SUCH WEAKNESS IN A WOMAN IS PLEASANT TO NO MAN BUT THEHUSBAND IN QUESTION. MORTALS ARE EASILY TEMPTED TO PINCH THE LIFE OUTOF THEIR NEIGHBORS BUZZING GLORY AND THINK THAT SUCH KILLING IS NOMURDER.NO INDEED HE ANSWERED PROMPTLY. AND THEREFORE IT IS A PITY THATIT SHOULD BE THROWN AWAY AS SO MUCH ENGLISH SCHOLARSHIP IS FOR WANTOF KNOWING WHAT IS BEING DONE BY THE REST OF THE WORLD. IF MR. CASAUBONREAD GERMAN HE WOULD SAVE HIMSELF A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE.I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU SAID DOROTHEA STARTLED AND ANXIOUS.I MERELY MEAN SAID WILL IN AN OFFHAND WAY THAT THE GERMANS HAVETAKEN THE LEAD IN HISTORICAL INQUIRIES AND THEY LAUGH AT RESULTS WHICHARE GOT BY GROPING ABOUT IN WOODS WITH A POCKETCOMPASS WHILE THEY HAVEMADE GOOD ROADS. WHEN I WAS WITH MR. CASAUBON I SAW THAT HE DEAFENEDHIMSELF IN THAT DIRECTION IT WAS ALMOST AGAINST HIS WILL THAT HE READA LATIN TREATISE WRITTEN BY A GERMAN. I WAS VERY SORRY.WILL ONLY THOUGHT OF GIVING A GOOD PINCH THAT WOULD ANNIHILATE THATVAUNTED LABORIOUSNESS AND WAS UNABLE TO IMAGINE THE MODE IN WHICHDOROTHEA WOULD BE WOUNDED. YOUNG MR. LADISLAW WAS NOT AT ALL DEEPHIMSELF IN GERMAN WRITERS BUT VERY LITTLE ACHIEVEMENT IS REQUIRED INORDER TO PITY ANOTHER MANS SHORTCOMINGS.POOR DOROTHEA FELT A PANG AT THE THOUGHT THAT THE LABOR OF HERHUSBANDS LIFE MIGHT BE VOID WHICH LEFT HER NO ENERGY TO SPARE FOR THEQUESTION WHETHER THIS YOUNG RELATIVE WHO WAS SO MUCH OBLIGED TO HIMOUGHT NOT TO HAVE REPRESSED HIS OBSERVATION. SHE DID NOT EVEN SPEAKBUT SAT LOOKING AT HER HANDS ABSORBED IN THE PITEOUSNESS OF THATTHOUGHT.WILL HOWEVER HAVING GIVEN THAT ANNIHILATING PINCH WAS RATHERASHAMED IMAGINING FROM DOROTHEAS SILENCE THAT HE HAD OFFENDED HERSTILL MORE AND HAVING ALSO A CONSCIENCE ABOUT PLUCKING THETAILFEATHERS FROM A BENEFACTOR.I REGRETTED IT ESPECIALLY HE RESUMED TAKING THE USUAL COURSE FROMDETRACTION TO INSINCERE EULOGY BECAUSE OF MY GRATITUDE AND RESPECTTOWARDS MY COUSIN. IT WOULD NOT SIGNIFY SO MUCH IN A MAN WHOSE TALENTSAND CHARACTER WERE LESS DISTINGUISHED.DOROTHEA RAISED HER EYES BRIGHTER THAN USUAL WITH EXCITED FEELING ANDSAID IN HER SADDEST RECITATIVE HOW I WISH I HAD LEARNED GERMAN WHEN IWAS AT LAUSANNE THERE WERE PLENTY OF GERMAN TEACHERS. BUT NOW I CAN BEOF NO USE.THERE WAS A NEW LIGHT BUT STILL A MYSTERIOUS LIGHT FOR WILL INDOROTHEAS LAST WORDS. THE QUESTION HOW SHE HAD COME TO ACCEPT MR.CASAUBONWHICH HE HAD DISMISSED WHEN HE FIRST SAW HER BY SAYING THATSHE MUST BE DISAGREEABLE IN SPITE OF APPEARANCESWAS NOT NOW TO BEANSWERED ON ANY SUCH SHORT AND EASY METHOD. WHATEVER ELSE SHE MIGHT BESHE WAS NOT DISAGREEABLE. SHE WAS NOT COLDLY CLEVER AND INDIRECTLYSATIRICAL BUT ADORABLY SIMPLE AND FULL OF FEELING. SHE WAS AN ANGELBEGUILED. IT WOULD BE A UNIQUE DELIGHT TO WAIT AND WATCH FOR THEMELODIOUS FRAGMENTS IN WHICH HER HEART AND SOUL CAME FORTH SO DIRECTLYAND INGENUOUSLY. THE AEOLIAN HARP AGAIN CAME INTO HIS MIND.SHE MUST HAVE MADE SOME ORIGINAL ROMANCE FOR HERSELF IN THIS MARRIAGE.AND IF MR. CASAUBON HAD BEEN A DRAGON WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF TO HISLAIR WITH HIS TALONS SIMPLY AND WITHOUT LEGAL FORMS IT WOULD HAVE BEENAN UNAVOIDABLE FEAT OF HEROISM TO RELEASE HER AND FALL AT HER FEET. BUTHE WAS SOMETHING MORE UNMANAGEABLE THAN A DRAGON HE WAS A BENEFACTORWITH COLLECTIVE SOCIETY AT HIS BACK AND HE WAS AT THAT MOMENT ENTERINGTHE ROOM IN ALL THE UNIMPEACHABLE CORRECTNESS OF HIS DEMEANOR WHILEDOROTHEA WAS LOOKING ANIMATED WITH A NEWLY ROUSED ALARM AND REGRET ANDWILL WAS LOOKING ANIMATED WITH HIS ADMIRING SPECULATION ABOUT HERFEELINGS.MR. CASAUBON FELT A SURPRISE WHICH WAS QUITE UNMIXED WITH PLEASURE BUTHE DID NOT SWERVE FROM HIS USUAL POLITENESS OF GREETING WHEN WILL ROSEAND EXPLAINED HIS PRESENCE. MR. CASAUBON WAS LESS HAPPY THAN USUAL ANDTHIS PERHAPS MADE HIM LOOK ALL THE DIMMER AND MORE FADED ELSE THEEFFECT MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY THE CONTRAST OF HIS YOUNGCOUSINS APPEARANCE. THE FIRST IMPRESSION ON SEEING WILL WAS ONE OFSUNNY BRIGHTNESS WHICH ADDED TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF HIS CHANGINGEXPRESSION. SURELY HIS VERY FEATURES CHANGED THEIR FORM HIS JAWLOOKED SOMETIMES LARGE AND SOMETIMES SMALL AND THE LITTLE RIPPLE INHIS NOSE WAS A PREPARATION FOR METAMORPHOSIS. WHEN HE TURNED HIS HEADQUICKLY HIS HAIR SEEMED TO SHAKE OUT LIGHT AND SOME PERSONS THOUGHTTHEY SAW DECIDED GENIUS IN THIS CORUSCATION. MR. CASAUBON ON THECONTRARY STOOD RAYLESS.AS DOROTHEAS EYES WERE TURNED ANXIOUSLY ON HER HUSBAND SHE WAS PERHAPSNOT INSENSIBLE TO THE CONTRAST BUT IT WAS ONLY MINGLED WITH OTHERCAUSES IN MAKING HER MORE CONSCIOUS OF THAT NEW ALARM ON HIS BEHALFWHICH WAS THE FIRST STIRRING OF A PITYING TENDERNESS FED BY THEREALITIES OF HIS LOT AND NOT BY HER OWN DREAMS. YET IT WAS A SOURCE OFGREATER FREEDOM TO HER THAT WILL WAS THERE HIS YOUNG EQUALITY WASAGREEABLE AND ALSO PERHAPS HIS OPENNESS TO CONVICTION. SHE FELT ANIMMENSE NEED OF SOME ONE TO SPEAK TO AND SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN ANYONE WHO SEEMED SO QUICK AND PLIABLE SO LIKELY TO UNDERSTANDEVERYTHING.MR. CASAUBON GRAVELY HOPED THAT WILL WAS PASSING HIS TIME PROFITABLY ASWELL AS PLEASANTLY IN ROMEHAD THOUGHT HIS INTENTION WAS TO REMAIN INSOUTH GERMANYBUT BEGGED HIM TO COME AND DINE TOMORROW WHEN HE COULDCONVERSE MORE AT LARGE AT PRESENT HE WAS SOMEWHAT WEARY. LADISLAWUNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTING THE INVITATION IMMEDIATELY TOOK HIS LEAVE.DOROTHEAS EYES FOLLOWED HER HUSBAND ANXIOUSLY WHILE HE SANK DOWNWEARILY AT THE END OF A SOFA AND RESTING HIS ELBOW SUPPORTED HIS HEADAND LOOKED ON THE FLOOR. A LITTLE FLUSHED AND WITH BRIGHT EYES SHESEATED HERSELF BESIDE HIM AND SAIDFORGIVE ME FOR SPEAKING SO HASTILY TO YOU THIS MORNING. I WAS WRONG. IFEAR I HURT YOU AND MADE THE DAY MORE BURDENSOME.I AM GLAD THAT YOU FEEL THAT MY DEAR SAID MR. CASAUBON. HE SPOKEQUIETLY AND BOWED HIS HEAD A LITTLE BUT THERE WAS STILL AN UNEASYFEELING IN HIS EYES AS HE LOOKED AT HER.BUT YOU DO FORGIVE ME SAID DOROTHEA WITH A QUICK SOB. IN HER NEEDFOR SOME MANIFESTATION OF FEELING SHE WAS READY TO EXAGGERATE HER OWNFAULT. WOULD NOT LOVE SEE RETURNING PENITENCE AFAR OFF AND FALL ON ITSNECK AND KISS ITMY DEAR DOROTHEAWHO WITH REPENTANCE IS NOT SATISFIED IS NOT OFHEAVEN NOR EARTHYOU DO NOT THINK ME WORTHY TO BE BANISHED BY THATSEVERE SENTENCE SAID MR. CASAUBON EXERTING HIMSELF TO MAKE A STRONGSTATEMENT AND ALSO TO SMILE FAINTLY.DOROTHEA WAS SILENT BUT A TEAR WHICH HAD COME UP WITH THE SOB WOULDINSIST ON FALLING.YOU ARE EXCITED MY DEAR. AND I ALSO AM FEELING SOME UNPLEASANTCONSEQUENCES OF TOO MUCH MENTAL DISTURBANCE SAID MR. CASAUBON. INFACT HE HAD IT IN HIS THOUGHT TO TELL HER THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO HAVERECEIVED YOUNG LADISLAW IN HIS ABSENCE BUT HE ABSTAINED PARTLY FROMTHE SENSE THAT IT WOULD BE UNGRACIOUS TO BRING A NEW COMPLAINT IN THEMOMENT OF HER PENITENT ACKNOWLEDGMENT PARTLY BECAUSE HE WANTED TOAVOID FURTHER AGITATION OF HIMSELF BY SPEECH AND PARTLY BECAUSE HE WASTOO PROUD TO BETRAY THAT JEALOUSY OF DISPOSITION WHICH WAS NOT SOEXHAUSTED ON HIS SCHOLARLY COMPEERS THAT THERE WAS NONE TO SPARE INOTHER DIRECTIONS. THERE IS A SORT OF JEALOUSY WHICH NEEDS VERY LITTLEFIRE IT IS HARDLY A PASSION BUT A BLIGHT BRED IN THE CLOUDY DAMPDESPONDENCY OF UNEASY EGOISM.I THINK IT IS TIME FOR US TO DRESS HE ADDED LOOKING AT HIS WATCH.THEY BOTH ROSE AND THERE WAS NEVER ANY FURTHER ALLUSION BETWEEN THEMTO WHAT HAD PASSED ON THIS DAY.BUT DOROTHEA REMEMBERED IT TO THE LAST WITH THE VIVIDNESS WITH WHICH WEALL REMEMBER EPOCHS IN OUR EXPERIENCE WHEN SOME DEAR EXPECTATION DIESOR SOME NEW MOTIVE IS BORN. TODAY SHE HAD BEGUN TO SEE THAT SHE HADBEEN UNDER A WILD ILLUSION IN EXPECTING A RESPONSE TO HER FEELING FROMMR. CASAUBON AND SHE HAD FELT THE WAKING OF A PRESENTIMENT THAT THEREMIGHT BE A SAD CONSCIOUSNESS IN HIS LIFE WHICH MADE AS GREAT A NEED ONHIS SIDE AS ON HER OWN.WE ARE ALL OF US BORN IN MORAL STUPIDITY TAKING THE WORLD AS AN UDDERTO FEED OUR SUPREME SELVES DOROTHEA HAD EARLY BEGUN TO EMERGE FROMTHAT STUPIDITY BUT YET IT HAD BEEN EASIER TO HER TO IMAGINE HOW SHEWOULD DEVOTE HERSELF TO MR. CASAUBON AND BECOME WISE AND STRONG IN HISSTRENGTH AND WISDOM THAN TO CONCEIVE WITH THAT DISTINCTNESS WHICH ISNO LONGER REFLECTION BUT FEELINGAN IDEA WROUGHT BACK TO THE DIRECTNESSOF SENSE LIKE THE SOLIDITY OF OBJECTSTHAT HE HAD AN EQUIVALENT CENTREOF SELF WHENCE THE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS MUST ALWAYS FALL WITH A CERTAINDIFFERENCE.CHAPTER XXII.NOUS CUSAMES LONGTEMPS ELLE TAIT SIMPLE ET BONNE.NE SACHANT PAS LE MAL ELLE FAISAIT LE BIENDES RICHESSES DU COEUR ELLE ME FIT LAUMNEET TOUT EN COUTANT COMME LE COEUR SE DONNESANS OSER Y PENSER JE LUI DONNAI LE MIENELLE EMPORTA MA VIE ET NEN SUT JAMAIS RIEN.ALFRED DE MUSSET.WILL LADISLAW WAS DELIGHTFULLY AGREEABLE AT DINNER THE NEXT DAY ANDGAVE NO OPPORTUNITY FOR MR. CASAUBON TO SHOW DISAPPROBATION. ON THECONTRARY IT SEEMED TO DOROTHEA THAT WILL HAD A HAPPIER WAY OF DRAWINGHER HUSBAND INTO CONVERSATION AND OF DEFERENTIALLY LISTENING TO HIMTHAN SHE HAD EVER OBSERVED IN ANY ONE BEFORE. TO BE SURE THE LISTENERSABOUT TIPTON WERE NOT HIGHLY GIFTED WILL TALKED A GOOD DEAL HIMSELFBUT WHAT HE SAID WAS THROWN IN WITH SUCH RAPIDITY AND WITH SUCH ANUNIMPORTANT AIR OF SAYING SOMETHING BY THE WAY THAT IT SEEMED A GAYLITTLE CHIME AFTER THE GREAT BELL. IF WILL WAS NOT ALWAYS PERFECT THISWAS CERTAINLY ONE OF HIS GOOD DAYS. HE DESCRIBED TOUCHES OF INCIDENTAMONG THE POOR PEOPLE IN ROME ONLY TO BE SEEN BY ONE WHO COULD MOVEABOUT FREELY HE FOUND HIMSELF IN AGREEMENT WITH MR. CASAUBON AS TO THEUNSOUND OPINIONS OF MIDDLETON CONCERNING THE RELATIONS OF JUDAISM ANDCATHOLICISM AND PASSED EASILY TO A HALFENTHUSIASTIC HALFPLAYFULPICTURE OF THE ENJOYMENT HE GOT OUT OF THE VERY MISCELLANEOUSNESS OFROME WHICH MADE THE MIND FLEXIBLE WITH CONSTANT COMPARISON AND SAVEDYOU FROM SEEING THE WORLDS AGES AS A SET OF BOXLIKE PARTITIONSWITHOUT VITAL CONNECTION. MR. CASAUBONS STUDIES WILL OBSERVED HADALWAYS BEEN OF TOO BROAD A KIND FOR THAT AND HE HAD PERHAPS NEVER FELTANY SUCH SUDDEN EFFECT BUT FOR HIMSELF HE CONFESSED THAT ROME HADGIVEN HIM QUITE A NEW SENSE OF HISTORY AS A WHOLE THE FRAGMENTSSTIMULATED HIS IMAGINATION AND MADE HIM CONSTRUCTIVE. THENOCCASIONALLY BUT NOT TOO OFTEN HE APPEALED TO DOROTHEA AND DISCUSSEDWHAT SHE SAID AS IF HER SENTIMENT WERE AN ITEM TO BE CONSIDERED IN THEFINAL JUDGMENT EVEN OF THE MADONNA DI FOLIGNO OR THE LAOCOON. A SENSEOF CONTRIBUTING TO FORM THE WORLDS OPINION MAKES CONVERSATIONPARTICULARLY CHEERFUL AND MR. CASAUBON TOO WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS PRIDEIN HIS YOUNG WIFE WHO SPOKE BETTER THAN MOST WOMEN AS INDEED HE HADPERCEIVED IN CHOOSING HER.SINCE THINGS WERE GOING ON SO PLEASANTLY MR. CASAUBONS STATEMENT THATHIS LABORS IN THE LIBRARY WOULD BE SUSPENDED FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS ANDTHAT AFTER A BRIEF RENEWAL HE SHOULD HAVE NO FURTHER REASON FOR STAYINGIN ROME ENCOURAGED WILL TO URGE THAT MRS. CASAUBON SHOULD NOT GO AWAYWITHOUT SEEING A STUDIO OR TWO. WOULD NOT MR. CASAUBON TAKE HER THATSORT OF THING OUGHT NOT TO BE MISSED IT WAS QUITE SPECIAL IT WAS AFORM OF LIFE THAT GREW LIKE A SMALL FRESH VEGETATION WITH ITSPOPULATION OF INSECTS ON HUGE FOSSILS. WILL WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONDUCTTHEMNOT TO ANYTHING WEARISOME ONLY TO A FEW EXAMPLES.MR. CASAUBON SEEING DOROTHEA LOOK EARNESTLY TOWARDS HIM COULD NOT BUTASK HER IF SHE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SUCH VISITS HE WAS NOW AT HERSERVICE DURING THE WHOLE DAY AND IT WAS AGREED THAT WILL SHOULD COMEON THE MORROW AND DRIVE WITH THEM.WILL COULD NOT OMIT THORWALDSEN A LIVING CELEBRITY ABOUT WHOM EVEN MR.CASAUBON INQUIRED BUT BEFORE THE DAY WAS FAR ADVANCED HE LED THE WAYTO THE STUDIO OF HIS FRIEND ADOLF NAUMANN WHOM HE MENTIONED AS ONE OFTHE CHIEF RENOVATORS OF CHRISTIAN ART ONE OF THOSE WHO HAD NOT ONLYREVIVED BUT EXPANDED THAT GRAND CONCEPTION OF SUPREME EVENTS ASMYSTERIES AT WHICH THE SUCCESSIVE AGES WERE SPECTATORS AND IN RELATIONTO WHICH THE GREAT SOULS OF ALL PERIODS BECAME AS IT WERECONTEMPORARIES. WILL ADDED THAT HE HAD MADE HIMSELF NAUMANNS PUPIL FORTHE NONCE.I HAVE BEEN MAKING SOME OILSKETCHES UNDER HIM SAID WILL. I HATECOPYING. I MUST PUT SOMETHING OF MY OWN IN. NAUMANN HAS BEEN PAINTINGTHE SAINTS DRAWING THE CAR OF THE CHURCH AND I HAVE BEEN MAKING ASKETCH OF MARLOWES TAMBURLAINE DRIVING THE CONQUERED KINGS IN HISCHARIOT. I AM NOT SO ECCLESIASTICAL AS NAUMANN AND I SOMETIMES TWITHIM WITH HIS EXCESS OF MEANING. BUT THIS TIME I MEAN TO OUTDO HIM INBREADTH OF INTENTION. I TAKE TAMBURLAINE IN HIS CHARIOT FOR THETREMENDOUS COURSE OF THE WORLDS PHYSICAL HISTORY LASHING ON THEHARNESSED DYNASTIES. IN MY OPINION THAT IS A GOOD MYTHICALINTERPRETATION. WILL HERE LOOKED AT MR. CASAUBON WHO RECEIVED THISOFFHAND TREATMENT OF SYMBOLISM VERY UNEASILY AND BOWED WITH A NEUTRALAIR.THE SKETCH MUST BE VERY GRAND IF IT CONVEYS SO MUCH SAID DOROTHEA.I SHOULD NEED SOME EXPLANATION EVEN OF THE MEANING YOU GIVE. DO YOUINTEND TAMBURLAINE TO REPRESENT EARTHQUAKES AND VOLCANOESOH YES SAID WILL LAUGHING AND MIGRATIONS OF RACES AND CLEARINGSOF FORESTSAND AMERICA AND THE STEAMENGINE. EVERYTHING YOU CANIMAGINEWHAT A DIFFICULT KIND OF SHORTHAND SAID DOROTHEA SMILING TOWARDSHER HUSBAND. IT WOULD REQUIRE ALL YOUR KNOWLEDGE TO BE ABLE TO READIT.MR. CASAUBON BLINKED FURTIVELY AT WILL. HE HAD A SUSPICION THAT HE WASBEING LAUGHED AT. BUT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO INCLUDE DOROTHEA IN THESUSPICION.THEY FOUND NAUMANN PAINTING INDUSTRIOUSLY BUT NO MODEL WAS PRESENTHIS PICTURES WERE ADVANTAGEOUSLY ARRANGED AND HIS OWN PLAIN VIVACIOUSPERSON SET OFF BY A DOVECOLORED BLOUSE AND A MAROON VELVET CAP SOTHAT EVERYTHING WAS AS FORTUNATE AS IF HE HAD EXPECTED THE BEAUTIFULYOUNG ENGLISH LADY EXACTLY AT THAT TIME.THE PAINTER IN HIS CONFIDENT ENGLISH GAVE LITTLE DISSERTATIONS ON HISFINISHED AND UNFINISHED SUBJECTS SEEMING TO OBSERVE MR. CASAUBON ASMUCH AS HE DID DOROTHEA. WILL BURST IN HERE AND THERE WITH ARDENT WORDSOF PRAISE MARKING OUT PARTICULAR MERITS IN HIS FRIENDS WORK ANDDOROTHEA FELT THAT SHE WAS GETTING QUITE NEW NOTIONS AS TO THESIGNIFICANCE OF MADONNAS SEATED UNDER INEXPLICABLE CANOPIED THRONESWITH THE SIMPLE COUNTRY AS A BACKGROUND AND OF SAINTS WITHARCHITECTURAL MODELS IN THEIR HANDS OR KNIVES ACCIDENTALLY WEDGED INTHEIR SKULLS. SOME THINGS WHICH HAD SEEMED MONSTROUS TO HER WEREGATHERING INTELLIGIBILITY AND EVEN A NATURAL MEANING BUT ALL THIS WASAPPARENTLY A BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE IN WHICH MR. CASAUBON HAD NOTINTERESTED HIMSELF.I THINK I WOULD RATHER FEEL THAT PAINTING IS BEAUTIFUL THAN HAVE TOREAD IT AS AN ENIGMA BUT I SHOULD LEARN TO UNDERSTAND THESE PICTURESSOONER THAN YOURS WITH THE VERY WIDE MEANING SAID DOROTHEA SPEAKINGTO WILL.DONT SPEAK OF MY PAINTING BEFORE NAUMANN SAID WILL. HE WILL TELLYOU IT IS ALL PFUSCHEREI WHICH IS HIS MOST OPPROBRIOUS WORDIS THAT TRUE SAID DOROTHEA TURNING HER SINCERE EYES ON NAUMANN WHOMADE A SLIGHT GRIMACE AND SAIDOH HE DOES NOT MEAN IT SERIOUSLY WITH PAINTING. HIS WALK MUST BEBELLESLETTRES. THAT IS WIIDE.NAUMANNS PRONUNCIATION OF THE VOWEL SEEMED TO STRETCH THE WORDSATIRICALLY. WILL DID NOT HALF LIKE IT BUT MANAGED TO LAUGH AND MR.CASAUBON WHILE HE FELT SOME DISGUST AT THE ARTISTS GERMAN ACCENTBEGAN TO ENTERTAIN A LITTLE RESPECT FOR HIS JUDICIOUS SEVERITY.THE RESPECT WAS NOT DIMINISHED WHEN NAUMANN AFTER DRAWING WILL ASIDEFOR A MOMENT AND LOOKING FIRST AT A LARGE CANVAS THEN AT MR.CASAUBON CAME FORWARD AGAIN AND SAIDMY FRIEND LADISLAW THINKS YOU WILL PARDON ME SIR IF I SAY THAT ASKETCH OF YOUR HEAD WOULD BE INVALUABLE TO ME FOR THE ST. THOMASAQUINAS IN MY PICTURE THERE. IT IS TOO MUCH TO ASK BUT I SO SELDOM SEEJUST WHAT I WANTTHE IDEALISTIC IN THE REAL.YOU ASTONISH ME GREATLY SIR SAID MR. CASAUBON HIS LOOKS IMPROVEDWITH A GLOW OF DELIGHT BUT IF MY POOR PHYSIOGNOMY WHICH I HAVE BEENACCUSTOMED TO REGARD AS OF THE COMMONEST ORDER CAN BE OF ANY USE TOYOU IN FURNISHING SOME TRAITS FOR THE ANGELICAL DOCTOR I SHALL FEELHONORED. THAT IS TO SAY IF THE OPERATION WILL NOT BE A LENGTHY ONEAND IF MRS. CASAUBON WILL NOT OBJECT TO THE DELAY.AS FOR DOROTHEA NOTHING COULD HAVE PLEASED HER MORE UNLESS IT HADBEEN A MIRACULOUS VOICE PRONOUNCING MR. CASAUBON THE WISEST ANDWORTHIEST AMONG THE SONS OF MEN. IN THAT CASE HER TOTTERING FAITH WOULDHAVE BECOME FIRM AGAIN.NAUMANNS APPARATUS WAS AT HAND IN WONDERFUL COMPLETENESS AND THESKETCH WENT ON AT ONCE AS WELL AS THE CONVERSATION. DOROTHEA SAT DOWNAND SUBSIDED INTO CALM SILENCE FEELING HAPPIER THAN SHE HAD DONE FOR ALONG WHILE BEFORE. EVERY ONE ABOUT HER SEEMED GOOD AND SHE SAID TOHERSELF THAT ROME IF SHE HAD ONLY BEEN LESS IGNORANT WOULD HAVE BEENFULL OF BEAUTY ITS SADNESS WOULD HAVE BEEN WINGED WITH HOPE. NO NATURECOULD BE LESS SUSPICIOUS THAN HERS WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD SHE BELIEVEDIN THE GRATITUDE OF WASPS AND THE HONORABLE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SPARROWSAND WAS PROPORTIONATELY INDIGNANT WHEN THEIR BASENESS WAS MADEMANIFEST.THE ADROIT ARTIST WAS ASKING MR. CASAUBON QUESTIONS ABOUT ENGLISHPOLITIES WHICH BROUGHT LONG ANSWERS AND WILL MEANWHILE HAD PERCHEDHIMSELF ON SOME STEPS IN THE BACKGROUND OVERLOOKING ALL.PRESENTLY NAUMANN SAIDNOW IF I COULD LAY THIS BY FOR HALF AN HOUR ANDTAKE IT UP AGAINCOME AND LOOK LADISLAWI THINK IT IS PERFECT SO FAR.WILL VENTED THOSE ADJURING INTERJECTIONS WHICH IMPLY THAT ADMIRATION ISTOO STRONG FOR SYNTAX AND NAUMANN SAID IN A TONE OF PITEOUS REGRETAHNOWIF I COULD BUT HAVE HAD MOREBUT YOU HAVE OTHER ENGAGEMENTSICOULD NOT ASK ITOR EVEN TO COME AGAIN TOMORROW.OH LET US STAY SAID DOROTHEA. WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO TODAY EXCEPTGO ABOUT HAVE WE SHE ADDED LOOKING ENTREATINGLY AT MR. CASAUBON.IT WOULD BE A PITY NOT TO MAKE THE HEAD AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE.I AM AT YOUR SERVICE SIR IN THE MATTER SAID MR. CASAUBON WITHPOLITE CONDESCENSION. HAVING GIVEN UP THE INTERIOR OF MY HEAD TOIDLENESS IT IS AS WELL THAT THE EXTERIOR SHOULD WORK IN THIS WAY.YOU ARE UNSPEAKABLY GOODNOW I AM HAPPY SAID NAUMANN AND THEN WENTON IN GERMAN TO WILL POINTING HERE AND THERE TO THE SKETCH AS IF HEWERE CONSIDERING THAT. PUTTING IT ASIDE FOR A MOMENT HE LOOKED ROUNDVAGUELY AS IF SEEKING SOME OCCUPATION FOR HIS VISITORS AND AFTERWARDSTURNING TO MR. CASAUBON SAIDPERHAPS THE BEAUTIFUL BRIDE THE GRACIOUS LADY WOULD NOT BE UNWILLINGTO LET ME FILL UP THE TIME BY TRYING TO MAKE A SLIGHT SKETCH OFHERNOT OF COURSE AS YOU SEE FOR THAT PICTUREONLY AS A SINGLESTUDY.MR. CASAUBON BOWING DOUBTED NOT THAT MRS. CASAUBON WOULD OBLIGE HIMAND DOROTHEA SAID AT ONCE WHERE SHALL I PUT MYSELFNAUMANN WAS ALL APOLOGIES IN ASKING HER TO STAND AND ALLOW HIM TOADJUST HER ATTITUDE TO WHICH SHE SUBMITTED WITHOUT ANY OF THE AFFECTEDAIRS AND LAUGHS FREQUENTLY THOUGHT NECESSARY ON SUCH OCCASIONS WHENTHE PAINTER SAID IT IS AS SANTA CLARA THAT I WANT YOU TOSTANDLEANING SO WITH YOUR CHEEK AGAINST YOUR HANDSOLOOKING AT THATSTOOL PLEASE SOWILL WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN THE INCLINATION TO FALL AT THE SAINTS FEETAND KISS HER ROBE AND THE TEMPTATION TO KNOCK NAUMANN DOWN WHILE HEWAS ADJUSTING HER ARM. ALL THIS WAS IMPUDENCE AND DESECRATION AND HEREPENTED THAT HE HAD BROUGHT HER.THE ARTIST WAS DILIGENT AND WILL RECOVERING HIMSELF MOVED ABOUT ANDOCCUPIED MR. CASAUBON AS INGENIOUSLY AS HE COULD BUT HE DID NOT IN THEEND PREVENT THE TIME FROM SEEMING LONG TO THAT GENTLEMAN AS WAS CLEARFROM HIS EXPRESSING A FEAR THAT MRS. CASAUBON WOULD BE TIRED. NAUMANNTOOK THE HINT AND SAIDNOW SIR IF YOU CAN OBLIGE ME AGAIN I WILL RELEASE THE LADYWIFE.SO MR. CASAUBONS PATIENCE HELD OUT FURTHER AND WHEN AFTER ALL ITTURNED OUT THAT THE HEAD OF SAINT THOMAS AQUINAS WOULD BE MORE PERFECTIF ANOTHER SITTING COULD BE HAD IT WAS GRANTED FOR THE MORROW. ON THEMORROW SANTA CLARA TOO WAS RETOUCHED MORE THAN ONCE. THE RESULT OF ALLWAS SO FAR FROM DISPLEASING TO MR. CASAUBON THAT HE ARRANGED FOR THEPURCHASE OF THE PICTURE IN WHICH SAINT THOMAS AQUINAS SAT AMONG THEDOCTORS OF THE CHURCH IN A DISPUTATION TOO ABSTRACT TO BE REPRESENTEDBUT LISTENED TO WITH MORE OR LESS ATTENTION BY AN AUDIENCE ABOVE. THESANTA CLARA WHICH WAS SPOKEN OF IN THE SECOND PLACE NAUMANN DECLAREDHIMSELF TO BE DISSATISFIED WITHHE COULD NOT IN CONSCIENCE ENGAGE TOMAKE A WORTHY PICTURE OF IT SO ABOUT THE SANTA CLARA THE ARRANGEMENTWAS CONDITIONAL.I WILL NOT DWELL ON NAUMANNS JOKES AT THE EXPENSE OF MR. CASAUBON THATEVENING OR ON HIS DITHYRAMBS ABOUT DOROTHEAS CHARM IN ALL WHICH WILLJOINED BUT WITH A DIFFERENCE. NO SOONER DID NAUMANN MENTION ANY DETAILOF DOROTHEAS BEAUTY THAN WILL GOT EXASPERATED AT HIS PRESUMPTIONTHERE WAS GROSSNESS IN HIS CHOICE OF THE MOST ORDINARY WORDS AND WHATBUSINESS HAD HE TO TALK OF HER LIPS SHE WAS NOT A WOMAN TO BE SPOKENOF AS OTHER WOMEN WERE. WILL COULD NOT SAY JUST WHAT HE THOUGHT BUT HEBECAME IRRITABLE. AND YET WHEN AFTER SOME RESISTANCE HE HAD CONSENTEDTO TAKE THE CASAUBONS TO HIS FRIENDS STUDIO HE HAD BEEN ALLURED BYTHE GRATIFICATION OF HIS PRIDE IN BEING THE PERSON WHO COULD GRANTNAUMANN SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY OF STUDYING HER LOVELINESSOR RATHER HERDIVINENESS FOR THE ORDINARY PHRASES WHICH MIGHT APPLY TO MERE BODILYPRETTINESS WERE NOT APPLICABLE TO HER. CERTAINLY ALL TIPTON AND ITSNEIGHBORHOOD AS WELL AS DOROTHEA HERSELF WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED ATHER BEAUTY BEING MADE SO MUCH OF. IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD MISS BROOKEHAD BEEN ONLY A FINE YOUNG WOMAN.OBLIGE ME BY LETTING THE SUBJECT DROP NAUMANN. MRS. CASAUBON IS NOTTO BE TALKED OF AS IF SHE WERE A MODEL SAID WILL. NAUMANN STARED ATHIM.SCHN I WILL TALK OF MY AQUINAS. THE HEAD IS NOT A BAD TYPE AFTERALL. I DARE SAY THE GREAT SCHOLASTIC HIMSELF WOULD HAVE BEEN FLATTEREDTO HAVE HIS PORTRAIT ASKED FOR. NOTHING LIKE THESE STARCHY DOCTORS FORVANITY IT WAS AS I THOUGHT HE CARED MUCH LESS FOR HER PORTRAIT THANHIS OWN.HES A CURSED WHITEBLOODED PEDANTIC COXCOMB SAID WILL WITHGNASHING IMPETUOSITY. HIS OBLIGATIONS TO MR. CASAUBON WERE NOT KNOWN TOHIS HEARER BUT WILL HIMSELF WAS THINKING OF THEM AND WISHING THAT HECOULD DISCHARGE THEM ALL BY A CHECK.NAUMANN GAVE A SHRUG AND SAID IT IS GOOD THEY GO AWAY SOON MY DEAR.THEY ARE SPOILING YOUR FINE TEMPER.ALL WILLS HOPE AND CONTRIVANCE WERE NOW CONCENTRATED ON SEEINGDOROTHEA WHEN SHE WAS ALONE. HE ONLY WANTED HER TO TAKE MORE EMPHATICNOTICE OF HIM HE ONLY WANTED TO BE SOMETHING MORE SPECIAL IN HERREMEMBRANCE THAN HE COULD YET BELIEVE HIMSELF LIKELY TO BE. HE WASRATHER IMPATIENT UNDER THAT OPEN ARDENT GOODWILL WHICH HE SAW WAS HERUSUAL STATE OF FEELING. THE REMOTE WORSHIP OF A WOMAN THRONED OUT OFTHEIR REACH PLAYS A GREAT PART IN MENS LIVES BUT IN MOST CASES THEWORSHIPPER LONGS FOR SOME QUEENLY RECOGNITION SOME APPROVING SIGN BYWHICH HIS SOULS SOVEREIGN MAY CHEER HIM WITHOUT DESCENDING FROM HERHIGH PLACE. THAT WAS PRECISELY WHAT WILL WANTED. BUT THERE WERE PLENTYOF CONTRADICTIONS IN HIS IMAGINATIVE DEMANDS. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL TO SEEHOW DOROTHEAS EYES TURNED WITH WIFELY ANXIETY AND BESEECHING TO MR.CASAUBON SHE WOULD HAVE LOST SOME OF HER HALO IF SHE HAD BEEN WITHOUTTHAT DUTEOUS PREOCCUPATION AND YET AT THE NEXT MOMENT THE HUSBANDSSANDY ABSORPTION OF SUCH NECTAR WAS TOO INTOLERABLE AND WILLS LONGINGTO SAY DAMAGING THINGS ABOUT HIM WAS PERHAPS NOT THE LESS TORMENTINGBECAUSE HE FELT THE STRONGEST REASONS FOR RESTRAINING IT.WILL HAD NOT BEEN INVITED TO DINE THE NEXT DAY. HENCE HE PERSUADEDHIMSELF THAT HE WAS BOUND TO CALL AND THAT THE ONLY ELIGIBLE TIME WASTHE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN MR. CASAUBON WOULD NOT BE AT HOME.DOROTHEA WHO HAD NOT BEEN MADE AWARE THAT HER FORMER RECEPTION OF WILLHAD DISPLEASED HER HUSBAND HAD NO HESITATION ABOUT SEEING HIMESPECIALLY AS HE MIGHT BE COME TO PAY A FAREWELL VISIT. WHEN HE ENTEREDSHE WAS LOOKING AT SOME CAMEOS WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BUYING FOR CELIA. SHEGREETED WILL AS IF HIS VISIT WERE QUITE A MATTER OF COURSE AND SAID ATONCE HAVING A CAMEO BRACELET IN HER HANDI AM SO GLAD YOU ARE COME. PERHAPS YOU UNDERSTAND ALL ABOUT CAMEOSAND CAN TELL ME IF THESE ARE REALLY GOOD. I WISHED TO HAVE YOU WITH USIN CHOOSING THEM BUT MR. CASAUBON OBJECTED HE THOUGHT THERE WAS NOTTIME. HE WILL FINISH HIS WORK TOMORROW AND WE SHALL GO AWAY IN THREEDAYS. I HAVE BEEN UNEASY ABOUT THESE CAMEOS. PRAY SIT DOWN AND LOOK ATTHEM.I AM NOT PARTICULARLY KNOWING BUT THERE CAN BE NO GREAT MISTAKE ABOUTTHESE LITTLE HOMERIC BITS THEY ARE EXQUISITELY NEAT. AND THE COLOR ISFINE IT WILL JUST SUIT YOU.OH THEY ARE FOR MY SISTER WHO HAS QUITE A DIFFERENT COMPLEXION. YOUSAW HER WITH ME AT LOWICK SHE IS LIGHTHAIRED AND VERY PRETTYAT LEASTI THINK SO. WE WERE NEVER SO LONG AWAY FROM EACH OTHER IN OUR LIVESBEFORE. SHE IS A GREAT PET AND NEVER WAS NAUGHTY IN HER LIFE. I FOUNDOUT BEFORE I CAME AWAY THAT SHE WANTED ME TO BUY HER SOME CAMEOS AND ISHOULD BE SORRY FOR THEM NOT TO BE GOODAFTER THEIR KIND. DOROTHEAADDED THE LAST WORDS WITH A SMILE.YOU SEEM NOT TO CARE ABOUT CAMEOS SAID WILL SEATING HIMSELF AT SOMEDISTANCE FROM HER AND OBSERVING HER WHILE SHE CLOSED THE CASES.NO FRANKLY I DONT THINK THEM A GREAT OBJECT IN LIFE SAIDDOROTHEA.I FEAR YOU ARE A HERETIC ABOUT ART GENERALLY. HOW IS THAT I SHOULDHAVE EXPECTED YOU TO BE VERY SENSITIVE TO THE BEAUTIFUL EVERYWHERE.I SUPPOSE I AM DULL ABOUT MANY THINGS SAID DOROTHEA SIMPLY. ISHOULD LIKE TO MAKE LIFE BEAUTIFULI MEAN EVERYBODYS LIFE. AND THENALL THIS IMMENSE EXPENSE OF ART THAT SEEMS SOMEHOW TO LIE OUTSIDE LIFEAND MAKE IT NO BETTER FOR THE WORLD PAINS ONE. IT SPOILS MY ENJOYMENTOF ANYTHING WHEN I AM MADE TO THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE SHUT OUT FROMIT.I CALL THAT THE FANATICISM OF SYMPATHY SAID WILL IMPETUOUSLY. YOUMIGHT SAY THE SAME OF LANDSCAPE OF POETRY OF ALL REFINEMENT. IF YOUCARRIED IT OUT YOU OUGHT TO BE MISERABLE IN YOUR OWN GOODNESS AND TURNEVIL THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE NO ADVANTAGE OVER OTHERS. THE BEST PIETY IS TOENJOYWHEN YOU CAN. YOU ARE DOING THE MOST THEN TO SAVE THE EARTHSCHARACTER AS AN AGREEABLE PLANET. AND ENJOYMENT RADIATES. IT IS OF NOUSE TO TRY AND TAKE CARE OF ALL THE WORLD THAT IS BEING TAKEN CARE OFWHEN YOU FEEL DELIGHTIN ART OR IN ANYTHING ELSE. WOULD YOU TURN ALLTHE YOUTH OF THE WORLD INTO A TRAGIC CHORUS WAILING AND MORALIZINGOVER MISERY I SUSPECT THAT YOU HAVE SOME FALSE BELIEF IN THE VIRTUESOF MISERY AND WANT TO MAKE YOUR LIFE A MARTYRDOM. WILL HAD GONEFURTHER THAN HE INTENDED AND CHECKED HIMSELF. BUT DOROTHEAS THOUGHTWAS NOT TAKING JUST THE SAME DIRECTION AS HIS OWN AND SHE ANSWEREDWITHOUT ANY SPECIAL EMOTIONINDEED YOU MISTAKE ME. I AM NOT A SAD MELANCHOLY CREATURE. I AM NEVERUNHAPPY LONG TOGETHER. I AM ANGRY AND NAUGHTYNOT LIKE CELIA I HAVE AGREAT OUTBURST AND THEN ALL SEEMS GLORIOUS AGAIN. I CANNOT HELPBELIEVING IN GLORIOUS THINGS IN A BLIND SORT OF WAY. I SHOULD BE QUITEWILLING TO ENJOY THE ART HERE BUT THERE IS SO MUCH THAT I DONT KNOWTHE REASON OFSO MUCH THAT SEEMS TO ME A CONSECRATION OF UGLINESSRATHER THAN BEAUTY. THE PAINTING AND SCULPTURE MAY BE WONDERFUL BUTTHE FEELING IS OFTEN LOW AND BRUTAL AND SOMETIMES EVEN RIDICULOUS.HERE AND THERE I SEE WHAT TAKES ME AT ONCE AS NOBLESOMETHING THAT IMIGHT COMPARE WITH THE ALBAN MOUNTAINS OR THE SUNSET FROM THE PINCIANHILL BUT THAT MAKES IT THE GREATER PITY THAT THERE IS SO LITTLE OF THEBEST KIND AMONG ALL THAT MASS OF THINGS OVER WHICH MEN HAVE TOILED SO.OF COURSE THERE IS ALWAYS A GREAT DEAL OF POOR WORK THE RARER THINGSWANT THAT SOIL TO GROW IN.OH DEAR SAID DOROTHEA TAKING UP THAT THOUGHT INTO THE CHIEF CURRENTOF HER ANXIETY I SEE IT MUST BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DO ANYTHING GOOD. IHAVE OFTEN FELT SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN ROME THAT MOST OF OUR LIVES WOULDLOOK MUCH UGLIER AND MORE BUNGLING THAN THE PICTURES IF THEY COULD BEPUT ON THE WALL.DOROTHEA PARTED HER LIPS AGAIN AS IF SHE WERE GOING TO SAY MORE BUTCHANGED HER MIND AND PAUSED.YOU ARE TOO YOUNGIT IS AN ANACHRONISM FOR YOU TO HAVE SUCH THOUGHTSSAID WILL ENERGETICALLY WITH A QUICK SHAKE OF THE HEAD HABITUAL TOHIM. YOU TALK AS IF YOU HAD NEVER KNOWN ANY YOUTH. IT IS MONSTROUSASIF YOU HAD HAD A VISION OF HADES IN YOUR CHILDHOOD LIKE THE BOY IN THELEGEND. YOU HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN SOME OF THOSE HORRIBLE NOTIONS THATCHOOSE THE SWEETEST WOMEN TO DEVOURLIKE MINOTAURS. AND NOW YOU WILL GOAND BE SHUT UP IN THAT STONE PRISON AT LOWICK YOU WILL BE BURIEDALIVE. IT MAKES ME SAVAGE TO THINK OF IT I WOULD RATHER NEVER HAVESEEN YOU THAN THINK OF YOU WITH SUCH A PROSPECT.WILL AGAIN FEARED THAT HE HAD GONE TOO FAR BUT THE MEANING WE ATTACHTO WORDS DEPENDS ON OUR FEELING AND HIS TONE OF ANGRY REGRET HAD SOMUCH KINDNESS IN IT FOR DOROTHEAS HEART WHICH HAD ALWAYS BEEN GIVINGOUT ARDOR AND HAD NEVER BEEN FED WITH MUCH FROM THE LIVING BEINGSAROUND HER THAT SHE FELT A NEW SENSE OF GRATITUDE AND ANSWERED WITH AGENTLE SMILEIT IS VERY GOOD OF YOU TO BE ANXIOUS ABOUT ME. IT IS BECAUSE YOU DIDNOT LIKE LOWICK YOURSELF YOU HAD SET YOUR HEART ON ANOTHER KIND OFLIFE. BUT LOWICK IS MY CHOSEN HOME.THE LAST SENTENCE WAS SPOKEN WITH AN ALMOST SOLEMN CADENCE AND WILLDID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY SINCE IT WOULD NOT BE USEFUL FOR HIM TOEMBRACE HER SLIPPERS AND TELL HER THAT HE WOULD DIE FOR HER IT WASCLEAR THAT SHE REQUIRED NOTHING OF THE SORT AND THEY WERE BOTH SILENTFOR A MOMENT OR TWO WHEN DOROTHEA BEGAN AGAIN WITH AN AIR OF SAYING ATLAST WHAT HAD BEEN IN HER MIND BEFOREHAND.I WANTED TO ASK YOU AGAIN ABOUT SOMETHING YOU SAID THE OTHER DAY.PERHAPS IT WAS HALF OF IT YOUR LIVELY WAY OF SPEAKING I NOTICE THATYOU LIKE TO PUT THINGS STRONGLY I MYSELF OFTEN EXAGGERATE WHEN I SPEAKHASTILY.WHAT WAS IT SAID WILL OBSERVING THAT SHE SPOKE WITH A TIMIDITYQUITE NEW IN HER. I HAVE A HYPERBOLICAL TONGUE IT CATCHES FIRE AS ITGOES. I DARE SAY I SHALL HAVE TO RETRACT.I MEAN WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF KNOWING GERMANI MEAN FORTHE SUBJECTS THAT MR. CASAUBON IS ENGAGED IN. I HAVE BEEN THINKINGABOUT IT AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WITH MR. CASAUBONS LEARNING HE MUSTHAVE BEFORE HIM THE SAME MATERIALS AS GERMAN SCHOLARSHAS HE NOTDOROTHEAS TIMIDITY WAS DUE TO AN INDISTINCT CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE WASIN THE STRANGE SITUATION OF CONSULTING A THIRD PERSON ABOUT THEADEQUACY OF MR. CASAUBONS LEARNING.NOT EXACTLY THE SAME MATERIALS SAID WILL THINKING THAT HE WOULD BEDULY RESERVED. HE IS NOT AN ORIENTALIST YOU KNOW. HE DOES NOT PROFESSTO HAVE MORE THAN SECONDHAND KNOWLEDGE THERE.BUT THERE ARE VERY VALUABLE BOOKS ABOUT ANTIQUITIES WHICH WERE WRITTENA LONG WHILE AGO BY SCHOLARS WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THESE MODERNTHINGS AND THEY ARE STILL USED. WHY SHOULD MR. CASAUBONS NOT BEVALUABLE LIKE THEIRS SAID DOROTHEA WITH MORE REMONSTRANT ENERGY.SHE WAS IMPELLED TO HAVE THE ARGUMENT ALOUD WHICH SHE HAD BEEN HAVINGIN HER OWN MIND.THAT DEPENDS ON THE LINE OF STUDY TAKEN SAID WILL ALSO GETTING ATONE OF REJOINDER. THE SUBJECT MR. CASAUBON HAS CHOSEN IS AS CHANGINGAS CHEMISTRY NEW DISCOVERIES ARE CONSTANTLY MAKING NEW POINTS OF VIEW.WHO WANTS A SYSTEM ON THE BASIS OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS OR A BOOK TOREFUTE PARACELSUS DO YOU NOT SEE THAT IT IS NO USE NOW TO BE CRAWLINGA LITTLE WAY AFTER MEN OF THE LAST CENTURYMEN LIKE BRYANTANDCORRECTING THEIR MISTAKESLIVING IN A LUMBERROOM AND FURBISHING UPBROKENLEGGED THEORIES ABOUT CHUS AND MIZRAIMHOW CAN YOU BEAR TO SPEAK SO LIGHTLY SAID DOROTHEA WITH A LOOKBETWEEN SORROW AND ANGER. IF IT WERE AS YOU SAY WHAT COULD BE SADDERTHAN SO MUCH ARDENT LABOR ALL IN VAIN I WONDER IT DOES NOT AFFECT YOUMORE PAINFULLY IF YOU REALLY THINK THAT A MAN LIKE MR. CASAUBON OF SOMUCH GOODNESS POWER AND LEARNING SHOULD IN ANY WAY FAIL IN WHAT HASBEEN THE LABOR OF HIS BEST YEARS. SHE WAS BEGINNING TO BE SHOCKED THATSHE HAD GOT TO SUCH A POINT OF SUPPOSITION AND INDIGNANT WITH WILL FORHAVING LED HER TO IT.YOU QUESTIONED ME ABOUT THE MATTER OF FACT NOT OF FEELING SAIDWILL. BUT IF YOU WISH TO PUNISH ME FOR THE FACT I SUBMIT. I AM NOT INA POSITION TO EXPRESS MY FEELING TOWARD MR. CASAUBON IT WOULD BE ATBEST A PENSIONERS EULOGY.PRAY EXCUSE ME SAID DOROTHEA COLORING DEEPLY. I AM AWARE AS YOUSAY THAT I AM IN FAULT IN HAVING INTRODUCED THE SUBJECT. INDEED I AMWRONG ALTOGETHER. FAILURE AFTER LONG PERSEVERANCE IS MUCH GRANDER THANNEVER TO HAVE A STRIVING GOOD ENOUGH TO BE CALLED A FAILURE.I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU SAID WILL DETERMINED TO CHANGE THESITUATIONSO MUCH SO THAT I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND NOT TO RUN THAT RISKOF NEVER ATTAINING A FAILURE. MR. CASAUBONS GENEROSITY HAS PERHAPSBEEN DANGEROUS TO ME AND I MEAN TO RENOUNCE THE LIBERTY IT HAS GIVENME. I MEAN TO GO BACK TO ENGLAND SHORTLY AND WORK MY OWN WAYDEPEND ONNOBODY ELSE THAN MYSELF.THAT IS FINEI RESPECT THAT FEELING SAID DOROTHEA WITH RETURNINGKINDNESS. BUT MR. CASAUBON I AM SURE HAS NEVER THOUGHT OF ANYTHINGIN THE MATTER EXCEPT WHAT WAS MOST FOR YOUR WELFARE.SHE HAS OBSTINACY AND PRIDE ENOUGH TO SERVE INSTEAD OF LOVE NOW SHEHAS MARRIED HIM SAID WILL TO HIMSELF. ALOUD HE SAID RISINGI SHALL NOT SEE YOU AGAIN.OH STAY TILL MR. CASAUBON COMES SAID DOROTHEA EARNESTLY. I AM SOGLAD WE MET IN ROME. I WANTED TO KNOW YOU.AND I HAVE MADE YOU ANGRY SAID WILL. I HAVE MADE YOU THINK ILL OFME.OH NO. MY SISTER TELLS ME I AM ALWAYS ANGRY WITH PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SAYJUST WHAT I LIKE. BUT I HOPE I AM NOT GIVEN TO THINK ILL OF THEM. INTHE END I AM USUALLY OBLIGED TO THINK ILL OF MYSELF FOR BEING SOIMPATIENT.STILL YOU DONT LIKE ME I HAVE MADE MYSELF AN UNPLEASANT THOUGHT TOYOU.NOT AT ALL SAID DOROTHEA WITH THE MOST OPEN KINDNESS. I LIKE YOUVERY MUCH.WILL WAS NOT QUITE CONTENTED THINKING THAT HE WOULD APPARENTLY HAVEBEEN OF MORE IMPORTANCE IF HE HAD BEEN DISLIKED. HE SAID NOTHING BUTLOOKED DULL NOT TO SAY SULKY.AND I AM QUITE INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT YOU WILL DO DOROTHEA WENT ONCHEERFULLY. I BELIEVE DEVOUTLY IN A NATURAL DIFFERENCE OF VOCATION. IFIT WERE NOT FOR THAT BELIEF I SUPPOSE I SHOULD BE VERY NARROWTHEREARE SO MANY THINGS BESIDES PAINTING THAT I AM QUITE IGNORANT OF. YOUWOULD HARDLY BELIEVE HOW LITTLE I HAVE TAKEN IN OF MUSIC ANDLITERATURE WHICH YOU KNOW SO MUCH OF. I WONDER WHAT YOUR VOCATION WILLTURN OUT TO BE PERHAPS YOU WILL BE A POETTHAT DEPENDS. TO BE A POET IS TO HAVE A SOUL SO QUICK TO DISCERN THATNO SHADE OF QUALITY ESCAPES IT AND SO QUICK TO FEEL THAT DISCERNMENTIS BUT A HAND PLAYING WITH FINELY ORDERED VARIETY ON THE CHORDS OFEMOTIONA SOUL IN WHICH KNOWLEDGE PASSES INSTANTANEOUSLY INTO FEELINGAND FEELING FLASHES BACK AS A NEW ORGAN OF KNOWLEDGE. ONE MAY HAVE THATCONDITION BY FITS ONLY.BUT YOU LEAVE OUT THE POEMS SAID DOROTHEA. I THINK THEY ARE WANTEDTO COMPLETE THE POET. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN ABOUT KNOWLEDGEPASSING INTO FEELING FOR THAT SEEMS TO BE JUST WHAT I EXPERIENCE. BUTI AM SURE I COULD NEVER PRODUCE A POEM.YOU ARE A POEMAND THAT IS TO BE THE BEST PART OF A POETWHAT MAKESUP THE POETS CONSCIOUSNESS IN HIS BEST MOODS SAID WILL SHOWING SUCHORIGINALITY AS WE ALL SHARE WITH THE MORNING AND THE SPRINGTIME ANDOTHER ENDLESS RENEWALS.I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID DOROTHEA LAUGHING OUT HER WORDS IN ABIRDLIKE MODULATION AND LOOKING AT WILL WITH PLAYFUL GRATITUDE IN HEREYES. WHAT VERY KIND THINGS YOU SAY TO MEI WISH I COULD EVER DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE WHAT YOU CALL KINDTHATI COULD EVER BE OF THE SLIGHTEST SERVICE TO YOU. I FEAR I SHALL NEVERHAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. WILL SPOKE WITH FERVOR.OH YES SAID DOROTHEA CORDIALLY. IT WILL COME AND I SHALL REMEMBERHOW WELL YOU WISH ME. I QUITE HOPED THAT WE SHOULD BE FRIENDS WHEN IFIRST SAW YOUBECAUSE OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO MR. CASAUBON. THERE WASA CERTAIN LIQUID BRIGHTNESS IN HER EYES AND WILL WAS CONSCIOUS THATHIS OWN WERE OBEYING A LAW OF NATURE AND FILLING TOO. THE ALLUSION TOMR. CASAUBON WOULD HAVE SPOILED ALL IF ANYTHING AT THAT MOMENT COULDHAVE SPOILED THE SUBDUING POWER THE SWEET DIGNITY OF HER NOBLEUNSUSPICIOUS INEXPERIENCE.AND THERE IS ONE THING EVEN NOW THAT YOU CAN DO SAID DOROTHEARISING AND WALKING A LITTLE WAY UNDER THE STRENGTH OF A RECURRINGIMPULSE. PROMISE ME THAT YOU WILL NOT AGAIN TO ANY ONE SPEAK OF THATSUBJECTI MEAN ABOUT MR. CASAUBONS WRITINGSI MEAN IN THAT KIND OFWAY. IT WAS I WHO LED TO IT. IT WAS MY FAULT. BUT PROMISE ME.SHE HAD RETURNED FROM HER BRIEF PACING AND STOOD OPPOSITE WILL LOOKINGGRAVELY AT HIM.CERTAINLY I WILL PROMISE YOU SAID WILL REDDENING HOWEVER. IF HENEVER SAID A CUTTING WORD ABOUT MR. CASAUBON AGAIN AND LEFT OFFRECEIVING FAVORS FROM HIM IT WOULD CLEARLY BE PERMISSIBLE TO HATE HIMTHE MORE. THE POET MUST KNOW HOW TO HATE SAYS GOETHE AND WILL WAS ATLEAST READY WITH THAT ACCOMPLISHMENT. HE SAID THAT HE MUST GO NOWWITHOUT WAITING FOR MR. CASAUBON WHOM HE WOULD COME TO TAKE LEAVE OFAT THE LAST MOMENT. DOROTHEA GAVE HIM HER HAND AND THEY EXCHANGED ASIMPLE GOODBY.BUT GOING OUT OF THE PORTE COCHERE HE MET MR. CASAUBON AND THATGENTLEMAN EXPRESSING THE BEST WISHES FOR HIS COUSIN POLITELY WAIVEDTHE PLEASURE OF ANY FURTHER LEAVETAKING ON THE MORROW WHICH WOULD BESUFFICIENTLY CROWDED WITH THE PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE.I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU ABOUT OUR COUSIN MR. LADISLAW WHICH ITHINK WILL HEIGHTEN YOUR OPINION OF HIM SAID DOROTHEA TO HER HUSBANDIN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING. SHE HAD MENTIONED IMMEDIATELY ON HISENTERING THAT WILL HAD JUST GONE AWAY AND WOULD COME AGAIN BUT MR.CASAUBON HAD SAID I MET HIM OUTSIDE AND WE MADE OUR FINAL ADIEUX IBELIEVE SAYING THIS WITH THE AIR AND TONE BY WHICH WE IMPLY THAT ANYSUBJECT WHETHER PRIVATE OR PUBLIC DOES NOT INTEREST US ENOUGH TO WISHFOR A FURTHER REMARK UPON IT. SO DOROTHEA HAD WAITED.WHAT IS THAT MY LOVE SAID MR CASAUBON HE ALWAYS SAID MY LOVEWHEN HIS MANNER WAS THE COLDEST.HE HAS MADE UP HIS MIND TO LEAVE OFF WANDERING AT ONCE AND TO GIVE UPHIS DEPENDENCE ON YOUR GENEROSITY. HE MEANS SOON TO GO BACK TO ENGLANDAND WORK HIS OWN WAY. I THOUGHT YOU WOULD CONSIDER THAT A GOOD SIGNSAID DOROTHEA WITH AN APPEALING LOOK INTO HER HUSBANDS NEUTRAL FACE.DID HE MENTION THE PRECISE ORDER OF OCCUPATION TO WHICH HE WOULDADDICT HIMSELFNO. BUT HE SAID THAT HE FELT THE DANGER WHICH LAY FOR HIM IN YOURGENEROSITY. OF COURSE HE WILL WRITE TO YOU ABOUT IT. DO YOU NOT THINKBETTER OF HIM FOR HIS RESOLVEI SHALL AWAIT HIS COMMUNICATION ON THE SUBJECT SAID MR. CASAUBON.I TOLD HIM I WAS SURE THAT THE THING YOU CONSIDERED IN ALL YOU DID FORHIM WAS HIS OWN WELFARE. I REMEMBERED YOUR GOODNESS IN WHAT YOU SAIDABOUT HIM WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM AT LOWICK SAID DOROTHEA PUTTING HERHAND ON HER HUSBANDS.I HAD A DUTY TOWARDS HIM SAID MR. CASAUBON LAYING HIS OTHER HAND ONDOROTHEAS IN CONSCIENTIOUS ACCEPTANCE OF HER CARESS BUT WITH A GLANCEWHICH HE COULD NOT HINDER FROM BEING UNEASY. THE YOUNG MAN I CONFESSIS NOT OTHERWISE AN OBJECT OF INTEREST TO ME NOR NEED WE I THINKDISCUSS HIS FUTURE COURSE WHICH IT IS NOT OURS TO DETERMINE BEYOND THELIMITS WHICH I HAVE SUFFICIENTLY INDICATED. DOROTHEA DID NOT MENTIONWILL AGAIN.BOOK III.WAITING FOR DEATH.CHAPTER XXIII.YOUR HORSES OF THE SUN HE SAID    AND FIRSTRATE WHIP APOLLOWHATEER THEY BE ILL EAT MY HEAD    BUT I WILL BEAT THEM HOLLOW.FRED VINCY WE HAVE SEEN HAD A DEBT ON HIS MIND AND THOUGH NO SUCHIMMATERIAL BURTHEN COULD DEPRESS THAT BUOYANTHEARTED YOUNG GENTLEMANFOR MANY HOURS TOGETHER THERE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THISDEBT WHICH MADE THE THOUGHT OF IT UNUSUALLY IMPORTUNATE. THE CREDITORWAS MR. BAMBRIDGE A HORSEDEALER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHOSE COMPANYWAS MUCH SOUGHT IN MIDDLEMARCH BY YOUNG MEN UNDERSTOOD TO BE ADDICTEDTO PLEASURE. DURING THE VACATIONS FRED HAD NATURALLY REQUIRED MOREAMUSEMENTS THAN HE HAD READY MONEY FOR AND MR. BAMBRIDGE HAD BEENACCOMMODATING ENOUGH NOT ONLY TO TRUST HIM FOR THE HIRE OF HORSES ANDTHE ACCIDENTAL EXPENSE OF RUINING A FINE HUNTER BUT ALSO TO MAKE ASMALL ADVANCE BY WHICH HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MEET SOME LOSSES ATBILLIARDS. THE TOTAL DEBT WAS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY POUNDS. BAMBRIDGE WASIN NO ALARM ABOUT HIS MONEY BEING SURE THAT YOUNG VINCY HAD BACKERSBUT HE HAD REQUIRED SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR IT AND FRED HAD AT FIRSTGIVEN A BILL WITH HIS OWN SIGNATURE. THREE MONTHS LATER HE HAD RENEWEDTHIS BILL WITH THE SIGNATURE OF CALEB GARTH. ON BOTH OCCASIONS FRED HADFELT CONFIDENT THAT HE SHOULD MEET THE BILL HIMSELF HAVING AMPLE FUNDSAT DISPOSAL IN HIS OWN HOPEFULNESS. YOU WILL HARDLY DEMAND THAT HISCONFIDENCE SHOULD HAVE A BASIS IN EXTERNAL FACTS SUCH CONFIDENCE WEKNOW IS SOMETHING LESS COARSE AND MATERIALISTIC IT IS A COMFORTABLEDISPOSITION LEADING US TO EXPECT THAT THE WISDOM OF PROVIDENCE OR THEFOLLY OF OUR FRIENDS THE MYSTERIES OF LUCK OR THE STILL GREATERMYSTERY OF OUR HIGH INDIVIDUAL VALUE IN THE UNIVERSE WILL BRING ABOUTAGREEABLE ISSUES SUCH AS ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR GOOD TASTE INCOSTUME AND OUR GENERAL PREFERENCE FOR THE BEST STYLE OF THING. FREDFELT SURE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE A PRESENT FROM HIS UNCLE THAT HE SHOULDHAVE A RUN OF LUCK THAT BY DINT OF SWAPPING HE SHOULD GRADUALLYMETAMORPHOSE A HORSE WORTH FORTY POUNDS INTO A HORSE THAT WOULD FETCH AHUNDRED AT ANY MOMENTJUDGMENT BEING ALWAYS EQUIVALENT TO ANUNSPECIFIED SUM IN HARD CASH. AND IN ANY CASE EVEN SUPPOSING NEGATIONSWHICH ONLY A MORBID DISTRUST COULD IMAGINE FRED HAD ALWAYS AT THATTIME HIS FATHERS POCKET AS A LAST RESOURCE SO THAT HIS ASSETS OFHOPEFULNESS HAD A SORT OF GORGEOUS SUPERFLUITY ABOUT THEM. OF WHATMIGHT BE THE CAPACITY OF HIS FATHERS POCKET FRED HAD ONLY A VAGUENOTION WAS NOT TRADE ELASTIC AND WOULD NOT THE DEFICIENCIES OF ONEYEAR BE MADE UP FOR BY THE SURPLUS OF ANOTHER THE VINCYS LIVED IN ANEASY PROFUSE WAY NOT WITH ANY NEW OSTENTATION BUT ACCORDING TO THEFAMILY HABITS AND TRADITIONS SO THAT THE CHILDREN HAD NO STANDARD OFECONOMY AND THE ELDER ONES RETAINED SOME OF THEIR INFANTINE NOTIONTHAT THEIR FATHER MIGHT PAY FOR ANYTHING IF HE WOULD. MR. VINCY HIMSELFHAD EXPENSIVE MIDDLEMARCH HABITSSPENT MONEY ON COURSING ON HISCELLAR AND ON DINNERGIVING WHILE MAMMA HAD THOSE RUNNING ACCOUNTSWITH TRADESPEOPLE WHICH GIVE A CHEERFUL SENSE OF GETTING EVERYTHINGONE WANTS WITHOUT ANY QUESTION OF PAYMENT. BUT IT WAS IN THE NATURE OFFATHERS FRED KNEW TO BULLY ONE ABOUT EXPENSES THERE WAS ALWAYS ALITTLE STORM OVER HIS EXTRAVAGANCE IF HE HAD TO DISCLOSE A DEBT ANDFRED DISLIKED BAD WEATHER WITHIN DOORS. HE WAS TOO FILIAL TO BEDISRESPECTFUL TO HIS FATHER AND HE BORE THE THUNDER WITH THE CERTAINTYTHAT IT WAS TRANSIENT BUT IN THE MEAN TIME IT WAS DISAGREEABLE TO SEEHIS MOTHER CRY AND ALSO TO BE OBLIGED TO LOOK SULKY INSTEAD OF HAVINGFUN FOR FRED WAS SO GOODTEMPERED THAT IF HE LOOKED GLUM UNDERSCOLDING IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR PROPRIETYS SAKE. THE EASIER COURSEPLAINLY WAS TO RENEW THE BILL WITH A FRIENDS SIGNATURE. WHY NOT WITHTHE SUPERFLUOUS SECURITIES OF HOPE AT HIS COMMAND THERE WAS NO REASONWHY HE SHOULD NOT HAVE INCREASED OTHER PEOPLES LIABILITIES TO ANYEXTENT BUT FOR THE FACT THAT MEN WHOSE NAMES WERE GOOD FOR ANYTHINGWERE USUALLY PESSIMISTS INDISPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT THE UNIVERSAL ORDEROF THINGS WOULD NECESSARILY BE AGREEABLE TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNGGENTLEMAN.WITH A FAVOR TO ASK WE REVIEW OUR LIST OF FRIENDS DO JUSTICE TO THEIRMORE AMIABLE QUALITIES FORGIVE THEIR LITTLE OFFENSES AND CONCERNINGEACH IN TURN TRY TO ARRIVE AT THE CONCLUSION THAT HE WILL BE EAGER TOOBLIGE US OUR OWN EAGERNESS TO BE OBLIGED BEING AS COMMUNICABLE ASOTHER WARMTH. STILL THERE IS ALWAYS A CERTAIN NUMBER WHO ARE DISMISSEDAS BUT MODERATELY EAGER UNTIL THE OTHERS HAVE REFUSED AND IT HAPPENEDTHAT FRED CHECKED OFF ALL HIS FRIENDS BUT ONE ON THE GROUND THATAPPLYING TO THEM WOULD BE DISAGREEABLE BEING IMPLICITLY CONVINCED THATHE AT LEAST WHATEVER MIGHT BE MAINTAINED ABOUT MANKIND GENERALLY HADA RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM ANYTHING DISAGREEABLE. THAT HE SHOULD EVER FALLINTO A THOROUGHLY UNPLEASANT POSITIONWEAR TROUSERS SHRUNK WITHWASHING EAT COLD MUTTON HAVE TO WALK FOR WANT OF A HORSE OR TO DUCKUNDER IN ANY SORT OF WAYWAS AN ABSURDITY IRRECONCILABLE WITH THOSECHEERFUL INTUITIONS IMPLANTED IN HIM BY NATURE. AND FRED WINCED UNDERTHE IDEA OF BEING LOOKED DOWN UPON AS WANTING FUNDS FOR SMALL DEBTS.THUS IT CAME TO PASS THAT THE FRIEND WHOM HE CHOSE TO APPLY TO WAS ATONCE THE POOREST AND THE KINDESTNAMELY CALEB GARTH.THE GARTHS WERE VERY FOND OF FRED AS HE WAS OF THEM FOR WHEN HE ANDROSAMOND WERE LITTLE ONES AND THE GARTHS WERE BETTER OFF THE SLIGHTCONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO FAMILIES THROUGH MR. FEATHERSTONES DOUBLEMARRIAGE THE FIRST TO MR. GARTHS SISTER AND THE SECOND TO MRS.VINCYS HAD LED TO AN ACQUAINTANCE WHICH WAS CARRIED ON BETWEEN THECHILDREN RATHER THAN THE PARENTS THE CHILDREN DRANK TEA TOGETHER OUTOF THEIR TOY TEACUPS AND SPENT WHOLE DAYS TOGETHER IN PLAY. MARY WAS ALITTLE HOYDEN AND FRED AT SIX YEARS OLD THOUGHT HER THE NICEST GIRL INTHE WORLD MAKING HER HIS WIFE WITH A BRASS RING WHICH HE HAD CUT FROMAN UMBRELLA. THROUGH ALL THE STAGES OF HIS EDUCATION HE HAD KEPT HISAFFECTION FOR THE GARTHS AND HIS HABIT OF GOING TO THEIR HOUSE AS ASECOND HOME THOUGH ANY INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THEM AND THE ELDERS OF HISFAMILY HAD LONG CEASED. EVEN WHEN CALEB GARTH WAS PROSPEROUS THEVINCYS WERE ON CONDESCENDING TERMS WITH HIM AND HIS WIFE FOR THEREWERE NICE DISTINCTIONS OF RANK IN MIDDLEMARCH AND THOUGH OLDMANUFACTURERS COULD NOT ANY MORE THAN DUKES BE CONNECTED WITH NONE BUTEQUALS THEY WERE CONSCIOUS OF AN INHERENT SOCIAL SUPERIORITY WHICH WASDEFINED WITH GREAT NICETY IN PRACTICE THOUGH HARDLY EXPRESSIBLETHEORETICALLY. SINCE THEN MR. GARTH HAD FAILED IN THE BUILDINGBUSINESS WHICH HE HAD UNFORTUNATELY ADDED TO HIS OTHER AVOCATIONS OFSURVEYOR VALUER AND AGENT HAD CONDUCTED THAT BUSINESS FOR A TIMEENTIRELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS ASSIGNEES AND HAD BEEN LIVINGNARROWLY EXERTING HIMSELF TO THE UTMOST THAT HE MIGHT AFTER ALL PAYTWENTY SHILLINGS IN THE POUND. HE HAD NOW ACHIEVED THIS AND FROM ALLWHO DID NOT THINK IT A BAD PRECEDENT HIS HONORABLE EXERTIONS HAD WONHIM DUE ESTEEM BUT IN NO PART OF THE WORLD IS GENTEEL VISITING FOUNDEDON ESTEEM IN THE ABSENCE OF SUITABLE FURNITURE AND COMPLETEDINNERSERVICE. MRS. VINCY HAD NEVER BEEN AT HER EASE WITH MRS. GARTHAND FREQUENTLY SPOKE OF HER AS A WOMAN WHO HAD HAD TO WORK FOR HERBREADMEANING THAT MRS. GARTH HAD BEEN A TEACHER BEFORE HER MARRIAGEIN WHICH CASE AN INTIMACY WITH LINDLEY MURRAY AND MANGNALLS QUESTIONSWAS SOMETHING LIKE A DRAPERS DISCRIMINATION OF CALICO TRADEMARKS OR ACOURIERS ACQUAINTANCE WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES NO WOMAN WHO WAS BETTEROFF NEEDED THAT SORT OF THING. AND SINCE MARY HAD BEEN KEEPING MR.FEATHERSTONES HOUSE MRS. VINCYS WANT OF LIKING FOR THE GARTHS HADBEEN CONVERTED INTO SOMETHING MORE POSITIVE BY ALARM LEST FRED SHOULDENGAGE HIMSELF TO THIS PLAIN GIRL WHOSE PARENTS LIVED IN SUCH A SMALLWAY. FRED BEING AWARE OF THIS NEVER SPOKE AT HOME OF HIS VISITS TOMRS. GARTH WHICH HAD OF LATE BECOME MORE FREQUENT THE INCREASINGARDOR OF HIS AFFECTION FOR MARY INCLINING HIM THE MORE TOWARDS THOSEWHO BELONGED TO HER.MR. GARTH HAD A SMALL OFFICE IN THE TOWN AND TO THIS FRED WENT WITHHIS REQUEST. HE OBTAINED IT WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY FOR A LARGE AMOUNTOF PAINFUL EXPERIENCE HAD NOT SUFFICED TO MAKE CALEB GARTH CAUTIOUSABOUT HIS OWN AFFAIRS OR DISTRUSTFUL OF HIS FELLOWMEN WHEN THEY HADNOT PROVED THEMSELVES UNTRUSTWORTHY AND HE HAD THE HIGHEST OPINION OFFRED WAS SURE THE LAD WOULD TURN OUT WELLAN OPEN AFFECTIONATEFELLOW WITH A GOOD BOTTOM TO HIS CHARACTERYOU MIGHT TRUST HIM FORANYTHING. SUCH WAS CALEBS PSYCHOLOGICAL ARGUMENT. HE WAS ONE OF THOSERARE MEN WHO ARE RIGID TO THEMSELVES AND INDULGENT TO OTHERS. HE HAD ACERTAIN SHAME ABOUT HIS NEIGHBORS ERRORS AND NEVER SPOKE OF THEMWILLINGLY HENCE HE WAS NOT LIKELY TO DIVERT HIS MIND FROM THE BESTMODE OF HARDENING TIMBER AND OTHER INGENIOUS DEVICES IN ORDER TOPRECONCEIVE THOSE ERRORS. IF HE HAD TO BLAME ANY ONE IT WAS NECESSARYFOR HIM TO MOVE ALL THE PAPERS WITHIN HIS REACH OR DESCRIBE VARIOUSDIAGRAMS WITH HIS STICK OR MAKE CALCULATIONS WITH THE ODD MONEY IN HISPOCKET BEFORE HE COULD BEGIN AND HE WOULD RATHER DO OTHER MENS WORKTHAN FIND FAULT WITH THEIR DOING. I FEAR HE WAS A BAD DISCIPLINARIAN.WHEN FRED STATED THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS DEBT HIS WISH TO MEET ITWITHOUT TROUBLING HIS FATHER AND THE CERTAINTY THAT THE MONEY WOULD BEFORTHCOMING SO AS TO CAUSE NO ONE ANY INCONVENIENCE CALEB PUSHED HISSPECTACLES UPWARD LISTENED LOOKED INTO HIS FAVORITES CLEAR YOUNGEYES AND BELIEVED HIM NOT DISTINGUISHING CONFIDENCE ABOUT THE FUTUREFROM VERACITY ABOUT THE PAST BUT HE FELT THAT IT WAS AN OCCASION FOR AFRIENDLY HINT AS TO CONDUCT AND THAT BEFORE GIVING HIS SIGNATURE HEMUST GIVE A RATHER STRONG ADMONITION. ACCORDINGLY HE TOOK THE PAPERAND LOWERED HIS SPECTACLES MEASURED THE SPACE AT HIS COMMAND REACHEDHIS PEN AND EXAMINED IT DIPPED IT IN THE INK AND EXAMINED IT AGAINTHEN PUSHED THE PAPER A LITTLE WAY FROM HIM LIFTED UP HIS SPECTACLESAGAIN SHOWED A DEEPENED DEPRESSION IN THE OUTER ANGLE OF HIS BUSHYEYEBROWS WHICH GAVE HIS FACE A PECULIAR MILDNESS PARDON THESE DETAILSFOR ONCEYOU WOULD HAVE LEARNED TO LOVE THEM IF YOU HAD KNOWN CALEBGARTH AND SAID IN A COMFORTABLE TONEIT WAS A MISFORTUNE EH THAT BREAKING THE HORSES KNEES AND THENTHESE EXCHANGES THEY DONT ANSWER WHEN YOU HAVE CUTE JOCKEYS TO DEALWITH. YOULL BE WISER ANOTHER TIME MY BOY.WHEREUPON CALEB DREW DOWN HIS SPECTACLES AND PROCEEDED TO WRITE HISSIGNATURE WITH THE CARE WHICH HE ALWAYS GAVE TO THAT PERFORMANCE FORWHATEVER HE DID IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS HE DID WELL. HE CONTEMPLATED THELARGE WELLPROPORTIONED LETTERS AND FINAL FLOURISH WITH HIS HEAD ATRIFLE ON ONE SIDE FOR AN INSTANT THEN HANDED IT TO FRED SAIDGOODBY AND RETURNED FORTHWITH TO HIS ABSORPTION IN A PLAN FOR SIRJAMES CHETTAMS NEW FARMBUILDINGS.EITHER BECAUSE HIS INTEREST IN THIS WORK THRUST THE INCIDENT OF THESIGNATURE FROM HIS MEMORY OR FOR SOME REASON OF WHICH CALEB WAS MORECONSCIOUS MRS. GARTH REMAINED IGNORANT OF THE AFFAIR.SINCE IT OCCURRED A CHANGE HAD COME OVER FREDS SKY WHICH ALTERED HISVIEW OF THE DISTANCE AND WAS THE REASON WHY HIS UNCLE FEATHERSTONESPRESENT OF MONEY WAS OF IMPORTANCE ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS COLOR COME ANDGO FIRST WITH A TOO DEFINITE EXPECTATION AND AFTERWARDS WITH APROPORTIONATE DISAPPOINTMENT. HIS FAILURE IN PASSING HIS EXAMINATIONHAD MADE HIS ACCUMULATION OF COLLEGE DEBTS THE MORE UNPARDONABLE BY HISFATHER AND THERE HAD BEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED STORM AT HOME. MR. VINCYHAD SWORN THAT IF HE HAD ANYTHING MORE OF THAT SORT TO PUT UP WITHFRED SHOULD TURN OUT AND GET HIS LIVING HOW HE COULD AND HE HAD NEVERYET QUITE RECOVERED HIS GOODHUMORED TONE TO HIS SON WHO HADESPECIALLY ENRAGED HIM BY SAYING AT THIS STAGE OF THINGS THAT HE DIDNOT WANT TO BE A CLERGYMAN AND WOULD RATHER NOT GO ON WITH THAT.FRED WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN YET MORE SEVERELY DEALT WITHIF HIS FAMILY AS WELL AS HIMSELF HAD NOT SECRETLY REGARDED HIM AS MR.FEATHERSTONES HEIR THAT OLD GENTLEMANS PRIDE IN HIM AND APPARENTFONDNESS FOR HIM SERVING IN THE STEAD OF MORE EXEMPLARY CONDUCTJUSTAS WHEN A YOUTHFUL NOBLEMAN STEALS JEWELLERY WE CALL THE ACTKLEPTOMANIA SPEAK OF IT WITH A PHILOSOPHICAL SMILE AND NEVER THINK OFHIS BEING SENT TO THE HOUSE OF CORRECTION AS IF HE WERE A RAGGED BOYWHO HAD STOLEN TURNIPS. IN FACT TACIT EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT WOULD BEDONE FOR HIM BY UNCLE FEATHERSTONE DETERMINED THE ANGLE AT WHICH MOSTPEOPLE VIEWED FRED VINCY IN MIDDLEMARCH AND IN HIS OWN CONSCIOUSNESSWHAT UNCLE FEATHERSTONE WOULD DO FOR HIM IN AN EMERGENCY OR WHAT HEWOULD DO SIMPLY AS AN INCORPORATED LUCK FORMED ALWAYS AN IMMEASURABLEDEPTH OF AERIAL PERSPECTIVE. BUT THAT PRESENT OF BANKNOTES ONCE MADEWAS MEASURABLE AND BEING APPLIED TO THE AMOUNT OF THE DEBT SHOWED ADEFICIT WHICH HAD STILL TO BE FILLED UP EITHER BY FREDS JUDGMENT ORBY LUCK IN SOME OTHER SHAPE. FOR THAT LITTLE EPISODE OF THE ALLEGEDBORROWING IN WHICH HE HAD MADE HIS FATHER THE AGENT IN GETTING THEBULSTRODE CERTIFICATE WAS A NEW REASON AGAINST GOING TO HIS FATHER FORMONEY TOWARDS MEETING HIS ACTUAL DEBT. FRED WAS KEEN ENOUGH TO FORESEETHAT ANGER WOULD CONFUSE DISTINCTIONS AND THAT HIS DENIAL OF HAVINGBORROWED EXPRESSLY ON THE STRENGTH OF HIS UNCLES WILL WOULD BE TAKENAS A FALSEHOOD. HE HAD GONE TO HIS FATHER AND TOLD HIM ONE VEXATIOUSAFFAIR AND HE HAD LEFT ANOTHER UNTOLD IN SUCH CASES THE COMPLETEREVELATION ALWAYS PRODUCES THE IMPRESSION OF A PREVIOUS DUPLICITY. NOWFRED PIQUED HIMSELF ON KEEPING CLEAR OF LIES AND EVEN FIBS HE OFTENSHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GRIMACE AT WHAT HE CALLEDROSAMONDS FIBS IT IS ONLY BROTHERS WHO CAN ASSOCIATE SUCH IDEAS WITHA LOVELY GIRL AND RATHER THAN INCUR THE ACCUSATION OF FALSEHOOD HEWOULD EVEN INCUR SOME TROUBLE AND SELFRESTRAINT. IT WAS UNDER STRONGINWARD PRESSURE OF THIS KIND THAT FRED HAD TAKEN THE WISE STEP OFDEPOSITING THE EIGHTY POUNDS WITH HIS MOTHER. IT WAS A PITY THAT HE HADNOT AT ONCE GIVEN THEM TO MR. GARTH BUT HE MEANT TO MAKE THE SUMCOMPLETE WITH ANOTHER SIXTY AND WITH A VIEW TO THIS HE HAD KEPTTWENTY POUNDS IN HIS OWN POCKET AS A SORT OF SEEDCORN WHICH PLANTEDBY JUDGMENT AND WATERED BY LUCK MIGHT YIELD MORE THAN THREEFOLDAVERY POOR RATE OF MULTIPLICATION WHEN THE FIELD IS A YOUNG GENTLEMANSINFINITE SOUL WITH ALL THE NUMERALS AT COMMAND.FRED WAS NOT A GAMBLER HE HAD NOT THAT SPECIFIC DISEASE IN WHICH THESUSPENSION OF THE WHOLE NERVOUS ENERGY ON A CHANCE OR RISK BECOMES ASNECESSARY AS THE DRAM TO THE DRUNKARD HE HAD ONLY THE TENDENCY TO THATDIFFUSIVE FORM OF GAMBLING WHICH HAS NO ALCOHOLIC INTENSITY BUT ISCARRIED ON WITH THE HEALTHIEST CHYLEFED BLOOD KEEPING UP A JOYOUSIMAGINATIVE ACTIVITY WHICH FASHIONS EVENTS ACCORDING TO DESIRE ANDHAVING NO FEARS ABOUT ITS OWN WEATHER ONLY SEES THE ADVANTAGE THEREMUST BE TO OTHERS IN GOING ABOARD WITH IT. HOPEFULNESS HAS A PLEASUREIN MAKING A THROW OF ANY KIND BECAUSE THE PROSPECT OF SUCCESS ISCERTAIN AND ONLY A MORE GENEROUS PLEASURE IN OFFERING AS MANY ASPOSSIBLE A SHARE IN THE STAKE. FRED LIKED PLAY ESPECIALLY BILLIARDSAS HE LIKED HUNTING OR RIDING A STEEPLECHASE AND HE ONLY LIKED IT THEBETTER BECAUSE HE WANTED MONEY AND HOPED TO WIN. BUT THE TWENTY POUNDSWORTH OF SEEDCORN HAD BEEN PLANTED IN VAIN IN THE SEDUCTIVE GREENPLOTALL OF IT AT LEAST WHICH HAD NOT BEEN DISPERSED BY THEROADSIDEAND FRED FOUND HIMSELF CLOSE UPON THE TERM OF PAYMENT WITH NOMONEY AT COMMAND BEYOND THE EIGHTY POUNDS WHICH HE HAD DEPOSITED WITHHIS MOTHER. THE BROKENWINDED HORSE WHICH HE RODE REPRESENTED A PRESENTWHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM A LONG WHILE AGO BY HIS UNCLE FEATHERSTONEHIS FATHER ALWAYS ALLOWED HIM TO KEEP A HORSE MR. VINCYS OWN HABITSMAKING HIM REGARD THIS AS A REASONABLE DEMAND EVEN FOR A SON WHO WASRATHER EXASPERATING. THIS HORSE THEN WAS FREDS PROPERTY AND IN HISANXIETY TO MEET THE IMMINENT BILL HE DETERMINED TO SACRIFICE APOSSESSION WITHOUT WHICH LIFE WOULD CERTAINLY BE WORTH LITTLE. HE MADETHE RESOLUTION WITH A SENSE OF HEROISMHEROISM FORCED ON HIM BY THEDREAD OF BREAKING HIS WORD TO MR. GARTH BY HIS LOVE FOR MARY AND AWEOF HER OPINION. HE WOULD START FOR HOUNDSLEY HORSEFAIR WHICH WAS TO BEHELD THE NEXT MORNING ANDSIMPLY SELL HIS HORSE BRINGING BACK THEMONEY BY COACHWELL THE HORSE WOULD HARDLY FETCH MORE THAN THIRTYPOUNDS AND THERE WAS NO KNOWING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IT WOULD BE FOLLYTO BALK HIMSELF OF LUCK BEFOREHAND. IT WAS A HUNDRED TO ONE THAT SOMEGOOD CHANCE WOULD FALL IN HIS WAY THE LONGER HE THOUGHT OF IT THELESS POSSIBLE IT SEEMED THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE A GOOD CHANCE AND THELESS REASONABLE THAT HE SHOULD NOT EQUIP HIMSELF WITH THE POWDER ANDSHOT FOR BRINGING IT DOWN. HE WOULD RIDE TO HOUNDSLEY WITH BAMBRIDGEAND WITH HORROCK THE VET AND WITHOUT ASKING THEM ANYTHING EXPRESSLYHE SHOULD VIRTUALLY GET THE BENEFIT OF THEIR OPINION. BEFORE HE SETOUT FRED GOT THE EIGHTY POUNDS FROM HIS MOTHER.MOST OF THOSE WHO SAW FRED RIDING OUT OF MIDDLEMARCH IN COMPANY WITHBAMBRIDGE AND HORROCK ON HIS WAY OF COURSE TO HOUNDSLEY HORSEFAIRTHOUGHT THAT YOUNG VINCY WAS PLEASURESEEKING AS USUAL AND BUT FOR ANUNWONTED CONSCIOUSNESS OF GRAVE MATTERS ON HAND HE HIMSELF WOULD HAVEHAD A SENSE OF DISSIPATION AND OF DOING WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED OF AGAY YOUNG FELLOW. CONSIDERING THAT FRED WAS NOT AT ALL COARSE THAT HERATHER LOOKED DOWN ON THE MANNERS AND SPEECH OF YOUNG MEN WHO HAD NOTBEEN TO THE UNIVERSITY AND THAT HE HAD WRITTEN STANZAS AS PASTORAL ANDUNVOLUPTUOUS AS HIS FLUTEPLAYING HIS ATTRACTION TOWARDS BAMBRIDGE ANDHORROCK WAS AN INTERESTING FACT WHICH EVEN THE LOVE OF HORSEFLESHWOULD NOT WHOLLY ACCOUNT FOR WITHOUT THAT MYSTERIOUS INFLUENCE OFNAMING WHICH DETERMINATES SO MUCH OF MORTAL CHOICE. UNDER ANY OTHERNAME THAN PLEASURE THE SOCIETY OF MESSIEURS BAMBRIDGE AND HORROCKMUST CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS MONOTONOUS AND TO ARRIVE WITHTHEM AT HOUNDSLEY ON A DRIZZLING AFTERNOON TO GET DOWN AT THE RED LIONIN A STREET SHADED WITH COALDUST AND DINE IN A ROOM FURNISHED WITH ADIRTENAMELLED MAP OF THE COUNTY A BAD PORTRAIT OF AN ANONYMOUS HORSEIN A STABLE HIS MAJESTY GEORGE THE FOURTH WITH LEGS AND CRAVAT ANDVARIOUS LEADEN SPITTOONS MIGHT HAVE SEEMED A HARD BUSINESS BUT FORTHE SUSTAINING POWER OF NOMENCLATURE WHICH DETERMINED THAT THE PURSUITOF THESE THINGS WAS GAY.IN MR. HORROCK THERE WAS CERTAINLY AN APPARENT UNFATHOMABLENESS WHICHOFFERED PLAY TO THE IMAGINATION. COSTUME AT A GLANCE GAVE HIM ATHRILLING ASSOCIATION WITH HORSES ENOUGH TO SPECIFY THE HATBRIM WHICHTOOK THE SLIGHTEST UPWARD ANGLE JUST TO ESCAPE THE SUSPICION OF BENDINGDOWNWARDS AND NATURE HAD GIVEN HIM A FACE WHICH BY DINT OF MONGOLIANEYES AND A NOSE MOUTH AND CHIN SEEMING TO FOLLOW HIS HATBRIM IN AMODERATE INCLINATION UPWARDS GAVE THE EFFECT OF A SUBDUED UNCHANGEABLESCEPTICAL SMILE OF ALL EXPRESSIONS THE MOST TYRANNOUS OVER ASUSCEPTIBLE MIND AND WHEN ACCOMPANIED BY ADEQUATE SILENCE LIKELY TOCREATE THE REPUTATION OF AN INVINCIBLE UNDERSTANDING AN INFINITE FUNDOF HUMORTOO DRY TO FLOW AND PROBABLY IN A STATE OF IMMOVABLECRUSTAND A CRITICAL JUDGMENT WHICH IF YOU COULD EVER BE FORTUNATEENOUGH TO KNOW IT WOULD BE THE THING AND NO OTHER. IT IS APHYSIOGNOMY SEEN IN ALL VOCATIONS BUT PERHAPS IT HAS NEVER BEEN MOREPOWERFUL OVER THE YOUTH OF ENGLAND THAN IN A JUDGE OF HORSES.MR. HORROCK AT A QUESTION FROM FRED ABOUT HIS HORSES FETLOCK TURNEDSIDEWAYS IN HIS SADDLE AND WATCHED THE HORSES ACTION FOR THE SPACE OFTHREE MINUTES THEN TURNED FORWARD TWITCHED HIS OWN BRIDLE ANDREMAINED SILENT WITH A PROFILE NEITHER MORE NOR LESS SCEPTICAL THAN ITHAD BEEN.THE PART THUS PLAYED IN DIALOGUE BY MR. HORROCK WAS TERRIBLY EFFECTIVE.A MIXTURE OF PASSIONS WAS EXCITED IN FREDA MAD DESIRE TO THRASHHORROCKS OPINION INTO UTTERANCE RESTRAINED BY ANXIETY TO RETAIN THEADVANTAGE OF HIS FRIENDSHIP. THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT HORROCKMIGHT SAY SOMETHING QUITE INVALUABLE AT THE RIGHT MOMENT.MR. BAMBRIDGE HAD MORE OPEN MANNERS AND APPEARED TO GIVE FORTH HISIDEAS WITHOUT ECONOMY. HE WAS LOUD ROBUST AND WAS SOMETIMES SPOKEN OFAS BEING GIVEN TO INDULGENCECHIEFLY IN SWEARING DRINKING ANDBEATING HIS WIFE. SOME PEOPLE WHO HAD LOST BY HIM CALLED HIM A VICIOUSMAN BUT HE REGARDED HORSEDEALING AS THE FINEST OF THE ARTS AND MIGHTHAVE ARGUED PLAUSIBLY THAT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MORALITY. HE WASUNDENIABLY A PROSPEROUS MAN BORE HIS DRINKING BETTER THAN OTHERS BORETHEIR MODERATION AND ON THE WHOLE FLOURISHED LIKE THE GREENBAYTREE. BUT HIS RANGE OF CONVERSATION WAS LIMITED AND LIKE THE FINEOLD TUNE DROPS OF BRANDY GAVE YOU AFTER A WHILE A SENSE OFRETURNING UPON ITSELF IN A WAY THAT MIGHT MAKE WEAK HEADS DIZZY. BUT ASLIGHT INFUSION OF MR. BAMBRIDGE WAS FELT TO GIVE TONE AND CHARACTER TOSEVERAL CIRCLES IN MIDDLEMARCH AND HE WAS A DISTINGUISHED FIGURE INTHE BAR AND BILLIARDROOM AT THE GREEN DRAGON. HE KNEW SOME ANECDOTESABOUT THE HEROES OF THE TURF AND VARIOUS CLEVER TRICKS OF MARQUESSESAND VISCOUNTS WHICH SEEMED TO PROVE THAT BLOOD ASSERTED ITSPREEMINENCE EVEN AMONG BLACKLEGS BUT THE MINUTE RETENTIVENESS OF HISMEMORY WAS CHIEFLY SHOWN ABOUT THE HORSES HE HAD HIMSELF BOUGHT ANDSOLD THE NUMBER OF MILES THEY WOULD TROT YOU IN NO TIME WITHOUTTURNING A HAIR BEING AFTER THE LAPSE OF YEARS STILL A SUBJECT OFPASSIONATE ASSEVERATION IN WHICH HE WOULD ASSIST THE IMAGINATION OFHIS HEARERS BY SOLEMNLY SWEARING THAT THEY NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT.IN SHORT MR. BAMBRIDGE WAS A MAN OF PLEASURE AND A GAY COMPANION.FRED WAS SUBTLE AND DID NOT TELL HIS FRIENDS THAT HE WAS GOING TOHOUNDSLEY BENT ON SELLING HIS HORSE HE WISHED TO GET INDIRECTLY ATTHEIR GENUINE OPINION OF ITS VALUE NOT BEING AWARE THAT A GENUINEOPINION WAS THE LAST THING LIKELY TO BE EXTRACTED FROM SUCH EMINENTCRITICS. IT WAS NOT MR. BAMBRIDGES WEAKNESS TO BE A GRATUITOUSFLATTERER. HE HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN SO MUCH STRUCK WITH THE FACT THATTHIS UNFORTUNATE BAY WAS A ROARER TO A DEGREE WHICH REQUIRED THEROUNDEST WORD FOR PERDITION TO GIVE YOU ANY IDEA OF IT.YOU MADE A BAD HAND AT SWAPPING WHEN YOU WENT TO ANYBODY BUT MEVINCY WHY YOU NEVER THREW YOUR LEG ACROSS A FINER HORSE THAN THATCHESTNUT AND YOU GAVE HIM FOR THIS BRUTE. IF YOU SET HIM CANTERING HEGOES ON LIKE TWENTY SAWYERS. I NEVER HEARD BUT ONE WORSE ROARER IN MYLIFE AND THAT WAS A ROAN IT BELONGED TO PEGWELL THE CORNFACTOR HEUSED TO DRIVE HIM IN HIS GIG SEVEN YEARS AGO AND HE WANTED ME TO TAKEHIM BUT I SAID THANK YOU PEG I DONT DEAL IN WINDINSTRUMENTS.THAT WAS WHAT I SAID. IT WENT THE ROUND OF THE COUNTRY THAT JOKE DID.BUT WHAT THE HELL THE HORSE WAS A PENNY TRUMPET TO THAT ROARER OFYOURS.WHY YOU SAID JUST NOW HIS WAS WORSE THAN MINE SAID FRED MOREIRRITABLE THAN USUAL.I SAID A LIE THEN SAID MR. BAMBRIDGE EMPHATICALLY. THERE WASNT APENNY TO CHOOSE BETWEEN EM.FRED SPURRED HIS HORSE AND THEY TROTTED ON A LITTLE WAY. WHEN THEYSLACKENED AGAIN MR. BAMBRIDGE SAIDNOT BUT WHAT THE ROAN WAS A BETTER TROTTER THAN YOURS.IM QUITE SATISFIED WITH HIS PACES I KNOW SAID FRED WHO REQUIREDALL THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING IN GAY COMPANY TO SUPPORT HIM I SAYHIS TROT IS AN UNCOMMONLY CLEAN ONE EH HORROCKMR. HORROCK LOOKED BEFORE HIM WITH AS COMPLETE A NEUTRALITY AS IF HEHAD BEEN A PORTRAIT BY A GREAT MASTER.FRED GAVE UP THE FALLACIOUS HOPE OF GETTING A GENUINE OPINION BUT ONREFLECTION HE SAW THAT BAMBRIDGES DEPRECIATION AND HORROCKS SILENCEWERE BOTH VIRTUALLY ENCOURAGING AND INDICATED THAT THEY THOUGHT BETTEROF THE HORSE THAN THEY CHOSE TO SAY.THAT VERY EVENING INDEED BEFORE THE FAIR HAD SET IN FRED THOUGHT HESAW A FAVORABLE OPENING FOR DISPOSING ADVANTAGEOUSLY OF HIS HORSE BUTAN OPENING WHICH MADE HIM CONGRATULATE HIMSELF ON HIS FORESIGHT INBRINGING WITH HIM HIS EIGHTY POUNDS. A YOUNG FARMER ACQUAINTED WITHMR. BAMBRIDGE CAME INTO THE RED LION AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATIONABOUT PARTING WITH A HUNTER WHICH HE INTRODUCED AT ONCE AS DIAMONDIMPLYING THAT IT WAS A PUBLIC CHARACTER. FOR HIMSELF HE ONLY WANTED AUSEFUL HACK WHICH WOULD DRAW UPON OCCASION BEING ABOUT TO MARRY ANDTO GIVE UP HUNTING. THE HUNTER WAS IN A FRIENDS STABLE AT SOME LITTLEDISTANCE THERE WAS STILL TIME FOR GENTLEMEN TO SEE IT BEFORE DARK. THEFRIENDS STABLE HAD TO BE REACHED THROUGH A BACK STREET WHERE YOU MIGHTAS EASILY HAVE BEEN POISONED WITHOUT EXPENSE OF DRUGS AS IN ANY GRIMSTREET OF THAT UNSANITARY PERIOD. FRED WAS NOT FORTIFIED AGAINSTDISGUST BY BRANDY AS HIS COMPANIONS WERE BUT THE HOPE OF HAVING ATLAST SEEN THE HORSE THAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO MAKE MONEY WASEXHILARATING ENOUGH TO LEAD HIM OVER THE SAME GROUND AGAIN THE FIRSTTHING IN THE MORNING. HE FELT SURE THAT IF HE DID NOT COME TO A BARGAINWITH THE FARMER BAMBRIDGE WOULD FOR THE STRESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES FREDFELT WAS SHARPENING HIS ACUTENESS AND ENDOWING HIM WITH ALL THECONSTRUCTIVE POWER OF SUSPICION. BAMBRIDGE HAD RUN DOWN DIAMOND IN AWAY THAT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE THE HORSE BEING A FRIENDS IF HEHAD NOT THOUGHT OF BUYING IT EVERY ONE WHO LOOKED AT THE ANIMALEVENHORROCKWAS EVIDENTLY IMPRESSED WITH ITS MERIT. TO GET ALL THEADVANTAGE OF BEING WITH MEN OF THIS SORT YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO DRAWYOUR INFERENCES AND NOT BE A SPOON WHO TAKES THINGS LITERALLY. THECOLOR OF THE HORSE WAS A DAPPLED GRAY AND FRED HAPPENED TO KNOW THATLORD MEDLICOTES MAN WAS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR JUST SUCH A HORSE. AFTERALL HIS RUNNING DOWN BAMBRIDGE LET IT OUT IN THE COURSE OF THEEVENING WHEN THE FARMER WAS ABSENT THAT HE HAD SEEN WORSE HORSES GOFOR EIGHTY POUNDS. OF COURSE HE CONTRADICTED HIMSELF TWENTY TIMES OVERBUT WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT IS LIKELY TO BE TRUE YOU CAN TEST A MANSADMISSIONS. AND FRED COULD NOT BUT RECKON HIS OWN JUDGMENT OF A HORSEAS WORTH SOMETHING. THE FARMER HAD PAUSED OVER FREDS RESPECTABLETHOUGH BROKENWINDED STEED LONG ENOUGH TO SHOW THAT HE THOUGHT IT WORTHCONSIDERATION AND IT SEEMED PROBABLE THAT HE WOULD TAKE IT WITHFIVEANDTWENTY POUNDS IN ADDITION AS THE EQUIVALENT OF DIAMOND. INTHAT CASE FRED WHEN HE HAD PARTED WITH HIS NEW HORSE FOR AT LEASTEIGHTY POUNDS WOULD BE FIFTYFIVE POUNDS IN POCKET BY THE TRANSACTIONAND WOULD HAVE A HUNDRED AND THIRTYFIVE POUNDS TOWARDS MEETING THEBILL SO THAT THE DEFICIT TEMPORARILY THROWN ON MR. GARTH WOULD AT THEUTMOST BE TWENTYFIVE POUNDS. BY THE TIME HE WAS HURRYING ON HISCLOTHES IN THE MORNING HE SAW SO CLEARLY THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT LOSINGTHIS RARE CHANCE THAT IF BAMBRIDGE AND HORROCK HAD BOTH DISSUADED HIMHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DELUDED INTO A DIRECT INTERPRETATION OF THEIRPURPOSE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE THAT THOSE DEEP HANDS HELD SOMETHINGELSE THAN A YOUNG FELLOWS INTEREST. WITH REGARD TO HORSES DISTRUSTWAS YOUR ONLY CLEW. BUT SCEPTICISM AS WE KNOW CAN NEVER BE THOROUGHLYAPPLIED ELSE LIFE WOULD COME TO A STANDSTILL SOMETHING WE MUSTBELIEVE IN AND DO AND WHATEVER THAT SOMETHING MAY BE CALLED IT ISVIRTUALLY OUR OWN JUDGMENT EVEN WHEN IT SEEMS LIKE THE MOST SLAVISHRELIANCE ON ANOTHER. FRED BELIEVED IN THE EXCELLENCE OF HIS BARGAINAND EVEN BEFORE THE FAIR HAD WELL SET IN HAD GOT POSSESSION OF THEDAPPLED GRAY AT THE PRICE OF HIS OLD HORSE AND THIRTY POUNDS INADDITIONONLY FIVE POUNDS MORE THAN HE HAD EXPECTED TO GIVE.BUT HE FELT A LITTLE WORRIED AND WEARIED PERHAPS WITH MENTAL DEBATEAND WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE FURTHER GAYETIES OF THE HORSEFAIR HE SETOUT ALONE ON HIS FOURTEEN MILES JOURNEY MEANING TO TAKE IT VERYQUIETLY AND KEEP HIS HORSE FRESH.CHAPTER XXIV.THE OFFENDERS SORROW BRINGS BUT SMALL RELIEFTO HIM WHO WEARS THE STRONG OFFENCES CROSS.SHAKESPEARE SONNETS.I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT ONLY THE THIRD DAY AFTER THE PROPITIOUS EVENTSAT HOUNDSLEY FRED VINCY HAD FALLEN INTO WORSE SPIRITS THAN HE HAD KNOWNIN HIS LIFE BEFORE. NOT THAT HE HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED AS TO THEPOSSIBLE MARKET FOR HIS HORSE BUT THAT BEFORE THE BARGAIN COULD BECONCLUDED WITH LORD MEDLICOTES MAN THIS DIAMOND IN WHICH HOPE TO THEAMOUNT OF EIGHTY POUNDS HAD BEEN INVESTED HAD WITHOUT THE SLIGHTESTWARNING EXHIBITED IN THE STABLE A MOST VICIOUS ENERGY IN KICKING HADJUST MISSED KILLING THE GROOM AND HAD ENDED IN LAMING HIMSELF SEVERELYBY CATCHING HIS LEG IN A ROPE THAT OVERHUNG THE STABLEBOARD. THERE WASNO MORE REDRESS FOR THIS THAN FOR THE DISCOVERY OF BAD TEMPER AFTERMARRIAGEWHICH OF COURSE OLD COMPANIONS WERE AWARE OF BEFORE THECEREMONY. FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER FRED HAD NONE OF HIS USUALELASTICITY UNDER THIS STROKE OF ILLFORTUNE HE WAS SIMPLY AWARE THATHE HAD ONLY FIFTY POUNDS THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIS GETTING ANYMORE AT PRESENT AND THAT THE BILL FOR A HUNDRED AND SIXTY WOULD BEPRESENTED IN FIVE DAYS. EVEN IF HE HAD APPLIED TO HIS FATHER ON THEPLEA THAT MR. GARTH SHOULD BE SAVED FROM LOSS FRED FELT SMARTINGLYTHAT HIS FATHER WOULD ANGRILY REFUSE TO RESCUE MR. GARTH FROM THECONSEQUENCE OF WHAT HE WOULD CALL ENCOURAGING EXTRAVAGANCE AND DECEIT.HE WAS SO UTTERLY DOWNCAST THAT HE COULD FRAME NO OTHER PROJECT THAN TOGO STRAIGHT TO MR. GARTH AND TELL HIM THE SAD TRUTH CARRYING WITH HIMTHE FIFTY POUNDS AND GETTING THAT SUM AT LEAST SAFELY OUT OF HIS OWNHANDS. HIS FATHER BEING AT THE WAREHOUSE DID NOT YET KNOW OF THEACCIDENT WHEN HE DID HE WOULD STORM ABOUT THE VICIOUS BRUTE BEINGBROUGHT INTO HIS STABLE AND BEFORE MEETING THAT LESSER ANNOYANCE FREDWANTED TO GET AWAY WITH ALL HIS COURAGE TO FACE THE GREATER. HE TOOKHIS FATHERS NAG FOR HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT WHEN HE HAD TOLD MR.GARTH HE WOULD RIDE TO STONE COURT AND CONFESS ALL TO MARY. IN FACTIT IS PROBABLE THAT BUT FOR MARYS EXISTENCE AND FREDS LOVE FOR HERHIS CONSCIENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH LESS ACTIVE BOTH IN PREVIOUSLYURGING THE DEBT ON HIS THOUGHT AND IMPELLING HIM NOT TO SPARE HIMSELFAFTER HIS USUAL FASHION BY DEFERRING AN UNPLEASANT TASK BUT TO ACT ASDIRECTLY AND SIMPLY AS HE COULD. EVEN MUCH STRONGER MORTALS THAN FREDVINCY HOLD HALF THEIR RECTITUDE IN THE MIND OF THE BEING THEY LOVEBEST. THE THEATRE OF ALL MY ACTIONS IS FALLEN SAID AN ANTIQUEPERSONAGE WHEN HIS CHIEF FRIEND WAS DEAD AND THEY ARE FORTUNATE WHOGET A THEATRE WHERE THE AUDIENCE DEMANDS THEIR BEST. CERTAINLY IT WOULDHAVE MADE A CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE TO FRED AT THAT TIME IF MARY GARTHHAD HAD NO DECIDED NOTIONS AS TO WHAT WAS ADMIRABLE IN CHARACTER.MR. GARTH WAS NOT AT THE OFFICE AND FRED RODE ON TO HIS HOUSE WHICHWAS A LITTLE WAY OUTSIDE THE TOWNA HOMELY PLACE WITH AN ORCHARD INFRONT OF IT A RAMBLING OLDFASHIONED HALFTIMBERED BUILDING WHICHBEFORE THE TOWN HAD SPREAD HAD BEEN A FARMHOUSE BUT WAS NOWSURROUNDED WITH THE PRIVATE GARDENS OF THE TOWNSMEN. WE GET THE FONDEROF OUR HOUSES IF THEY HAVE A PHYSIOGNOMY OF THEIR OWN AS OUR FRIENDSHAVE. THE GARTH FAMILY WHICH WAS RATHER A LARGE ONE FOR MARY HAD FOURBROTHERS AND ONE SISTER WERE VERY FOND OF THEIR OLD HOUSE FROM WHICHALL THE BEST FURNITURE HAD LONG BEEN SOLD. FRED LIKED IT TOO KNOWINGIT BY HEART EVEN TO THE ATTIC WHICH SMELT DELICIOUSLY OF APPLES ANDQUINCES AND UNTIL TODAY HE HAD NEVER COME TO IT WITHOUT PLEASANTEXPECTATIONS BUT HIS HEART BEAT UNEASILY NOW WITH THE SENSE THAT HESHOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO MAKE HIS CONFESSION BEFORE MRS. GARTH OF WHOMHE WAS RATHER MORE IN AWE THAN OF HER HUSBAND. NOT THAT SHE WASINCLINED TO SARCASM AND TO IMPULSIVE SALLIES AS MARY WAS. IN HERPRESENT MATRONLY AGE AT LEAST MRS. GARTH NEVER COMMITTED HERSELF BYOVERHASTY SPEECH HAVING AS SHE SAID BORNE THE YOKE IN HER YOUTHAND LEARNED SELFCONTROL. SHE HAD THAT RARE SENSE WHICH DISCERNS WHATIS UNALTERABLE AND SUBMITS TO IT WITHOUT MURMURING. ADORING HERHUSBANDS VIRTUES SHE HAD VERY EARLY MADE UP HER MIND TO HISINCAPACITY OF MINDING HIS OWN INTERESTS AND HAD MET THE CONSEQUENCESCHEERFULLY. SHE HAD BEEN MAGNANIMOUS ENOUGH TO RENOUNCE ALL PRIDE INTEAPOTS OR CHILDRENS FRILLING AND HAD NEVER POURED ANY PATHETICCONFIDENCES INTO THE EARS OF HER FEMININE NEIGHBORS CONCERNING MR.GARTHS WANT OF PRUDENCE AND THE SUMS HE MIGHT HAVE HAD IF HE HAD BEENLIKE OTHER MEN. HENCE THESE FAIR NEIGHBORS THOUGHT HER EITHER PROUD ORECCENTRIC AND SOMETIMES SPOKE OF HER TO THEIR HUSBANDS AS YOUR FINEMRS. GARTH. SHE WAS NOT WITHOUT HER CRITICISM OF THEM IN RETURN BEINGMORE ACCURATELY INSTRUCTED THAN MOST MATRONS IN MIDDLEMARCH ANDWHEREIS THE BLAMELESS WOMANAPT TO BE A LITTLE SEVERE TOWARDS HER OWN SEXWHICH IN HER OPINION WAS FRAMED TO BE ENTIRELY SUBORDINATE. ON THEOTHER HAND SHE WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY INDULGENT TOWARDS THE FAILINGSOF MEN AND WAS OFTEN HEARD TO SAY THAT THESE WERE NATURAL. ALSO ITMUST BE ADMITTED THAT MRS. GARTH WAS A TRIFLE TOO EMPHATIC IN HERRESISTANCE TO WHAT SHE HELD TO BE FOLLIES THE PASSAGE FROM GOVERNESSINTO HOUSEWIFE HAD WROUGHT ITSELF A LITTLE TOO STRONGLY INTO HERCONSCIOUSNESS AND SHE RARELY FORGOT THAT WHILE HER GRAMMAR AND ACCENTWERE ABOVE THE TOWN STANDARD SHE WORE A PLAIN CAP COOKED THE FAMILYDINNER AND DARNED ALL THE STOCKINGS. SHE HAD SOMETIMES TAKEN PUPILS INA PERIPATETIC FASHION MAKING THEM FOLLOW HER ABOUT IN THE KITCHEN WITHTHEIR BOOK OR SLATE. SHE THOUGHT IT GOOD FOR THEM TO SEE THAT SHE COULDMAKE AN EXCELLENT LATHER WHILE SHE CORRECTED THEIR BLUNDERS WITHOUTLOOKINGTHAT A WOMAN WITH HER SLEEVES TUCKED UP ABOVE HER ELBOWSMIGHT KNOW ALL ABOUT THE SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD OR THE TORRID ZONETHAT INSHORT SHE MIGHT POSSESS EDUCATION AND OTHER GOOD THINGS ENDING INTION AND WORTHY TO BE PRONOUNCED EMPHATICALLY WITHOUT BEING AUSELESS DOLL. WHEN SHE MADE REMARKS TO THIS EDIFYING EFFECT SHE HAD AFIRM LITTLE FROWN ON HER BROW WHICH YET DID NOT HINDER HER FACE FROMLOOKING BENEVOLENT AND HER WORDS WHICH CAME FORTH LIKE A PROCESSIONWERE UTTERED IN A FERVID AGREEABLE CONTRALTO. CERTAINLY THE EXEMPLARYMRS. GARTH HAD HER DROLL ASPECTS BUT HER CHARACTER SUSTAINED HERODDITIES AS A VERY FINE WINE SUSTAINS A FLAVOR OF SKIN.TOWARDS FRED VINCY SHE HAD A MOTHERLY FEELING AND HAD ALWAYS BEENDISPOSED TO EXCUSE HIS ERRORS THOUGH SHE WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVEEXCUSED MARY FOR ENGAGING HERSELF TO HIM HER DAUGHTER BEING INCLUDEDIN THAT MORE RIGOROUS JUDGMENT WHICH SHE APPLIED TO HER OWN SEX. BUTTHIS VERY FACT OF HER EXCEPTIONAL INDULGENCE TOWARDS HIM MADE IT THEHARDER TO FRED THAT HE MUST NOW INEVITABLY SINK IN HER OPINION. AND THECIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS VISIT TURNED OUT TO BE STILL MORE UNPLEASANT THANHE HAD EXPECTED FOR CALEB GARTH HAD GONE OUT EARLY TO LOOK AT SOMEREPAIRS NOT FAR OFF. MRS. GARTH AT CERTAIN HOURS WAS ALWAYS IN THEKITCHEN AND THIS MORNING SHE WAS CARRYING ON SEVERAL OCCUPATIONS ATONCE THEREMAKING HER PIES AT THE WELLSCOURED DEAL TABLE ON ONE SIDEOF THAT AIRY ROOM OBSERVING SALLYS MOVEMENTS AT THE OVEN ANDDOUGHTUB THROUGH AN OPEN DOOR AND GIVING LESSONS TO HER YOUNGEST BOYAND GIRL WHO WERE STANDING OPPOSITE TO HER AT THE TABLE WITH THEIRBOOKS AND SLATES BEFORE THEM. A TUB AND A CLOTHESHORSE AT THE OTHEREND OF THE KITCHEN INDICATED AN INTERMITTENT WASH OF SMALL THINGS ALSOGOING ON.MRS. GARTH WITH HER SLEEVES TURNED ABOVE HER ELBOWS DEFTLY HANDLINGHER PASTRYAPPLYING HER ROLLINGPIN AND GIVING ORNAMENTAL PINCHESWHILE SHE EXPOUNDED WITH GRAMMATICAL FERVOR WHAT WERE THE RIGHT VIEWSABOUT THE CONCORD OF VERBS AND PRONOUNS WITH NOUNS OF MULTITUDE ORSIGNIFYING MANY WAS A SIGHT AGREEABLY AMUSING. SHE WAS OF THE SAMECURLYHAIRED SQUAREFACED TYPE AS MARY BUT HANDSOMER WITH MOREDELICACY OF FEATURE A PALE SKIN A SOLID MATRONLY FIGURE AND AREMARKABLE FIRMNESS OF GLANCE. IN HER SNOWYFRILLED CAP SHE REMINDEDONE OF THAT DELIGHTFUL FRENCHWOMAN WHOM WE HAVE ALL SEEN MARKETINGBASKET ON ARM. LOOKING AT THE MOTHER YOU MIGHT HOPE THAT THE DAUGHTERWOULD BECOME LIKE HER WHICH IS A PROSPECTIVE ADVANTAGE EQUAL TO ADOWRYTHE MOTHER TOO OFTEN STANDING BEHIND THE DAUGHTER LIKE AMALIGNANT PROPHECYSUCH AS I AM SHE WILL SHORTLY BE.NOW LET US GO THROUGH THAT ONCE MORE SAID MRS. GARTH PINCHING ANAPPLEPUFF WHICH SEEMED TO DISTRACT BEN AN ENERGETIC YOUNG MALE WITH AHEAVY BROW FROM DUE ATTENTION TO THE LESSON. NOT WITHOUT REGARD TOTHE IMPORT OF THE WORD AS CONVEYING UNITY OR PLURALITY OF IDEATELL MEAGAIN WHAT THAT MEANS BEN.MRS. GARTH LIKE MORE CELEBRATED EDUCATORS HAD HER FAVORITE ANCIENTPATHS AND IN A GENERAL WRECK OF SOCIETY WOULD HAVE TRIED TO HOLD HERLINDLEY MURRAY ABOVE THE WAVES.OHIT MEANSYOU MUST THINK WHAT YOU MEAN SAID BEN RATHER PEEVISHLY.I HATE GRAMMAR.

HOW COULD A SHIPOFF THE SEA COME THERETHESE THINGS BELONG ONLY TO PRONUNCIATION WHICH IS THE LEAST PART OFGRAMMAR SAID MRS. GARTH. THAT APPLEPEEL IS TO BE EATEN BY THE PIGSBEN IF YOU EAT IT I MUST GIVE THEM YOUR PIECE OF PASTY. JOB HAS ONLYTO SPEAK ABOUT VERY PLAIN THINGS. HOW DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD WRITE ORSPEAK ABOUT ANYTHING MORE DIFFICULT IF YOU KNEW NO MORE OF GRAMMARTHAN HE DOES YOU WOULD USE WRONG WORDS AND PUT WORDS IN THE WRONGPLACES AND INSTEAD OF MAKING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND YOU THEY WOULD TURNAWAY FROM YOU AS A TIRESOME PERSON. WHAT WOULD YOU DO THENI SHOULDNT CARE I SHOULD LEAVE OFF SAID BEN WITH A SENSE THATTHIS WAS AN AGREEABLE ISSUE WHERE GRAMMAR WAS CONCERNED.I SEE YOU ARE GETTING TIRED AND STUPID BEN SAID MRS. GARTHACCUSTOMED TO THESE OBSTRUCTIVE ARGUMENTS FROM HER MALE OFFSPRING.HAVING FINISHED HER PIES SHE MOVED TOWARDS THE CLOTHESHORSE ANDSAID COME HERE AND TELL ME THE STORY I TOLD YOU ON WEDNESDAY ABOUTCINCINNATUS.I KNOW HE WAS A FARMER SAID BEN.NOW BEN HE WAS A ROMANLET ME TELL SAID LETTY USING HER ELBOWCONTENTIOUSLY.YOU SILLY THING HE WAS A ROMAN FARMER AND HE WAS PLOUGHING.YES BUT BEFORE THATTHAT DIDNT COME FIRSTPEOPLE WANTED HIM SAIDLETTY.WELL BUT YOU MUST SAY WHAT SORT OF A MAN HE WAS FIRST INSISTED BEN.HE WAS A WISE MAN LIKE MY FATHER AND THAT MADE THE PEOPLE WANT HISADVICE.

HOW RUDE YOU LOOK PUSHING ANDFROWNING AS IF YOU WANTED TO CONQUER WITH YOUR ELBOWS CINCINNATUS IAM SURE WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER BEHAVE SO. MRS.GARTH DELIVERED THIS AWFUL SENTENCE WITH MUCH MAJESTY OF ENUNCIATIONAND LETTY FELT THAT BETWEEN REPRESSED VOLUBILITY AND GENERAL DISESTEEMTHAT OF THE ROMANS INCLUSIVE LIFE WAS ALREADY A PAINFUL AFFAIR.

GARTH HAD NOT AGAIN LOOKED AT FRED AND WAS NOT IN THE LEASTCALCULATING WHAT WORDS SHE SHOULD USE TO CUT HIM THE MOST EFFECTIVELY.LIKE THE ECCENTRIC WOMAN SHE WAS SHE WAS AT PRESENT ABSORBED INCONSIDERING WHAT WAS TO BE DONE AND DID NOT FANCY THAT THE END COULDBE BETTER ACHIEVED BY BITTER REMARKS OR EXPLOSIONS. BUT SHE HAD MADEFRED FEEL FOR THE FIRST TIME SOMETHING LIKE THE TOOTH OF REMORSE.CURIOUSLY ENOUGH HIS PAIN IN THE AFFAIR BEFOREHAND HAD CONSISTEDALMOST ENTIRELY IN THE SENSE THAT HE MUST SEEM DISHONORABLE AND SINKIN THE OPINION OF THE GARTHS HE HAD NOT OCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH THEINCONVENIENCE AND POSSIBLE INJURY THAT HIS BREACH MIGHT OCCASION THEMFOR THIS EXERCISE OF THE IMAGINATION ON OTHER PEOPLES NEEDS IS NOTCOMMON WITH HOPEFUL YOUNG GENTLEMEN. INDEED WE ARE MOST OF US BROUGHTUP IN THE NOTION THAT THE HIGHEST MOTIVE FOR NOT DOING A WRONG ISSOMETHING IRRESPECTIVE OF THE BEINGS WHO WOULD SUFFER THE WRONG. BUT ATTHIS MOMENT HE SUDDENLY SAW HIMSELF AS A PITIFUL RASCAL WHO WAS ROBBINGTWO WOMEN OF THEIR SAVINGS.I SHALL CERTAINLY PAY IT ALL MRS. GARTHULTIMATELY HE STAMMEREDOUT.YES ULTIMATELY SAID MRS. GARTH WHO HAVING A SPECIAL DISLIKE TOFINE WORDS ON UGLY OCCASIONS COULD NOT NOW REPRESS AN EPIGRAM. BUTBOYS CANNOT WELL BE APPRENTICED ULTIMATELY THEY SHOULD BE APPRENTICEDAT FIFTEEN. SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SO LITTLE INCLINED TO MAKE EXCUSES FORFRED.I WAS THE MOST IN THE WRONG SUSAN SAID CALEB. FRED MADE SURE OFFINDING THE MONEY. BUT ID NO BUSINESS TO BE FINGERING BILLS. I SUPPOSEYOU HAVE LOOKED ALL ROUND AND TRIED ALL HONEST MEANS HE ADDED FIXINGHIS MERCIFUL GRAY EYES ON FRED. CALEB WAS TOO DELICATE TO SPECIFY MR.FEATHERSTONE.YES I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHINGI REALLY HAVE. I SHOULD HAVE HAD AHUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS READY BUT FOR A MISFORTUNE WITH A HORSE WHICHI WAS ABOUT TO SELL. MY UNCLE HAD GIVEN ME EIGHTY POUNDS AND I PAIDAWAY THIRTY WITH MY OLD HORSE IN ORDER TO GET ANOTHER WHICH I WAS GOINGTO SELL FOR EIGHTY OR MOREI MEANT TO GO WITHOUT A HORSEBUT NOW IT HASTURNED OUT VICIOUS AND LAMED ITSELF. I WISH I AND THE HORSES TOO HADBEEN AT THE DEVIL BEFORE I HAD BROUGHT THIS ON YOU. THERES NO ONEELSE I CARE SO MUCH FOR YOU AND MRS. GARTH HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO KIND TOME. HOWEVER ITS NO USE SAYING THAT. YOU WILL ALWAYS THINK ME A RASCALNOW.FRED TURNED ROUND AND HURRIED OUT OF THE ROOM CONSCIOUS THAT HE WASGETTING RATHER WOMANISH AND FEELING CONFUSEDLY THAT HIS BEING SORRYWAS NOT OF MUCH USE TO THE GARTHS. THEY COULD SEE HIM MOUNT ANDQUICKLY PASS THROUGH THE GATE.I AM DISAPPOINTED IN FRED VINCY SAID MRS. GARTH. I WOULD NOT HAVEBELIEVED BEFOREHAND THAT HE WOULD HAVE DRAWN YOU INTO HIS DEBTS. I KNEWHE WAS EXTRAVAGANT BUT I DID NOT THINK THAT HE WOULD BE SO MEAN AS TOHANG HIS RISKS ON HIS OLDEST FRIEND WHO COULD THE LEAST AFFORD TOLOSE.I WAS A FOOL SUSAN.THAT YOU WERE SAID THE WIFE NODDING AND SMILING. BUT I SHOULD NOTHAVE GONE TO PUBLISH IT IN THE MARKETPLACE. WHY SHOULD YOU KEEP SUCHTHINGS FROM ME IT IS JUST SO WITH YOUR BUTTONS YOU LET THEM BURST OFFWITHOUT TELLING ME AND GO OUT WITH YOUR WRISTBAND HANGING. IF I HADONLY KNOWN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN READY WITH SOME BETTER PLAN.YOU ARE SADLY CUT UP I KNOW SUSAN SAID CALEB LOOKING FEELINGLY ATHER. I CANT ABIDE YOUR LOSING THE MONEY YOUVE SCRAPED TOGETHER FORALFRED.IT IS VERY WELL THAT I HAD SCRAPED IT TOGETHER AND IT IS YOU WHOWILL HAVE TO SUFFER FOR YOU MUST TEACH THE BOY YOURSELF. YOU MUST GIVEUP YOUR BAD HABITS. SOME MEN TAKE TO DRINKING AND YOU HAVE TAKEN TOWORKING WITHOUT PAY. YOU MUST INDULGE YOURSELF A LITTLE LESS IN THAT.AND YOU MUST RIDE OVER TO MARY AND ASK THE CHILD WHAT MONEY SHE HAS.CALEB HAD PUSHED HIS CHAIR BACK AND WAS LEANING FORWARD SHAKING HISHEAD SLOWLY AND FITTING HIS FINGERTIPS TOGETHER WITH MUCH NICETY.POOR MARY HE SAID. SUSAN HE WENT ON IN A LOWERED TONE IMAFRAID SHE MAY BE FOND OF FRED.OH NO SHE ALWAYS LAUGHS AT HIM AND HE IS NOT LIKELY TO THINK OF HERIN ANY OTHER THAN A BROTHERLY WAY.CALEB MADE NO REJOINDER BUT PRESENTLY LOWERED HIS SPECTACLES DREW UPHIS CHAIR TO THE DESK AND SAID DEUCE TAKE THE BILLI WISH IT WAS ATHANOVER THESE THINGS ARE A SAD INTERRUPTION TO BUSINESSTHE FIRST PART OF THIS SPEECH COMPRISED HIS WHOLE STORE OF MALEDICTORYEXPRESSION AND WAS UTTERED WITH A SLIGHT SNARL EASY TO IMAGINE. BUT ITWOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONVEY TO THOSE WHO NEVER HEARD HIM UTTER THEWORD BUSINESS THE PECULIAR TONE OF FERVID VENERATION OF RELIGIOUSREGARD IN WHICH HE WRAPPED IT AS A CONSECRATED SYMBOL IS WRAPPED INITS GOLDFRINGED LINEN.CALEB GARTH OFTEN SHOOK HIS HEAD IN MEDITATION ON THE VALUE THEINDISPENSABLE MIGHT OF THAT MYRIADHEADED MYRIADHANDED LABOR BY WHICHTHE SOCIAL BODY IS FED CLOTHED AND HOUSED. IT HAD LAID HOLD OF HISIMAGINATION IN BOYHOOD. THE ECHOES OF THE GREAT HAMMER WHERE ROOF ORKEEL WERE AMAKING THE SIGNALSHOUTS OF THE WORKMEN THE ROAR OF THEFURNACE THE THUNDER AND PLASH OF THE ENGINE WERE A SUBLIME MUSIC TOHIM THE FELLING AND LADING OF TIMBER AND THE HUGE TRUNK VIBRATINGSTARLIKE IN THE DISTANCE ALONG THE HIGHWAY THE CRANE AT WORK ON THEWHARF THE PILEDUP PRODUCE IN WAREHOUSES THE PRECISION AND VARIETY OFMUSCULAR EFFORT WHEREVER EXACT WORK HAD TO BE TURNED OUTALL THESESIGHTS OF HIS YOUTH HAD ACTED ON HIM AS POETRY WITHOUT THE AID OF THEPOETS HAD MADE A PHILOSOPHY FOR HIM WITHOUT THE AID OF PHILOSOPHERS ARELIGION WITHOUT THE AID OF THEOLOGY. HIS EARLY AMBITION HAD BEEN TOHAVE AS EFFECTIVE A SHARE AS POSSIBLE IN THIS SUBLIME LABOR WHICH WASPECULIARLY DIGNIFIED BY HIM WITH THE NAME OF BUSINESS AND THOUGH HEHAD ONLY BEEN A SHORT TIME UNDER A SURVEYOR AND HAD BEEN CHIEFLY HISOWN TEACHER HE KNEW MORE OF LAND BUILDING AND MINING THAN MOST OFTHE SPECIAL MEN IN THE COUNTY.HIS CLASSIFICATION OF HUMAN EMPLOYMENTS WAS RATHER CRUDE AND LIKE THECATEGORIES OF MORE CELEBRATED MEN WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE IN THESEADVANCED TIMES. HE DIVIDED THEM INTO BUSINESS POLITICS PREACHINGLEARNING AND AMUSEMENT. HE HAD NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST THE LAST FOURBUT HE REGARDED THEM AS A REVERENTIAL PAGAN REGARDED OTHER GODS THANHIS OWN. IN THE SAME WAY HE THOUGHT VERY WELL OF ALL RANKS BUT HEWOULD NOT HIMSELF HAVE LIKED TO BE OF ANY RANK IN WHICH HE HAD NOT SUCHCLOSE CONTACT WITH BUSINESS AS TO GET OFTEN HONORABLY DECORATED WITHMARKS OF DUST AND MORTAR THE DAMP OF THE ENGINE OR THE SWEET SOIL OFTHE WOODS AND FIELDS. THOUGH HE HAD NEVER REGARDED HIMSELF AS OTHERTHAN AN ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN AND WOULD ARGUE ON PREVENIENT GRACE IF THESUBJECT WERE PROPOSED TO HIM I THINK HIS VIRTUAL DIVINITIES WERE GOODPRACTICAL SCHEMES ACCURATE WORK AND THE FAITHFUL COMPLETION OFUNDERTAKINGS HIS PRINCE OF DARKNESS WAS A SLACK WORKMAN. BUT THERE WASNO SPIRIT OF DENIAL IN CALEB AND THE WORLD SEEMED SO WONDROUS TO HIMTHAT HE WAS READY TO ACCEPT ANY NUMBER OF SYSTEMS LIKE ANY NUMBER OFFIRMAMENTS IF THEY DID NOT OBVIOUSLY INTERFERE WITH THE BESTLANDDRAINAGE SOLID BUILDING CORRECT MEASURING AND JUDICIOUS BORINGFOR COAL. IN FACT HE HAD A REVERENTIAL SOUL WITH A STRONG PRACTICALINTELLIGENCE. BUT HE COULD NOT MANAGE FINANCE HE KNEW VALUES WELL BUTHE HAD NO KEENNESS OF IMAGINATION FOR MONETARY RESULTS IN THE SHAPE OFPROFIT AND LOSS AND HAVING ASCERTAINED THIS TO HIS COST HE DETERMINEDTO GIVE UP ALL FORMS OF HIS BELOVED BUSINESS WHICH REQUIRED THATTALENT. HE GAVE HIMSELF UP ENTIRELY TO THE MANY KINDS OF WORK WHICH HECOULD DO WITHOUT HANDLING CAPITAL AND WAS ONE OF THOSE PRECIOUS MENWITHIN HIS OWN DISTRICT WHOM EVERYBODY WOULD CHOOSE TO WORK FOR THEMBECAUSE HE DID HIS WORK WELL CHARGED VERY LITTLE AND OFTEN DECLINEDTO CHARGE AT ALL. IT IS NO WONDER THEN THAT THE GARTHS WERE POOR ANDLIVED IN A SMALL WAY. HOWEVER THEY DID NOT MIND IT.CHAPTER XXV.LOVE SEEKETH NOT ITSELF TO PLEASE    NOR FOR ITSELF HATH ANY CAREBUT FOR ANOTHER GIVES ITS EASE    AND BUILDS A HEAVEN IN HELLS DESPAIR.. . . . . . .LOVE SEEKETH ONLY SELF TO PLEASE    TO BIND ANOTHER TO ITS DELIGHTJOYS IN ANOTHERS LOSS OF EASE    AND BUILDS A HELL IN HEAVENS DESPITE.W. BLAKE SONGS OF EXPERIENCE.FRED VINCY WANTED TO ARRIVE AT STONE COURT WHEN MARY COULD NOT EXPECTHIM AND WHEN HIS UNCLE WAS NOT DOWNSTAIRS IN THAT CASE SHE MIGHT BESITTING ALONE IN THE WAINSCOTED PARLOR. HE LEFT HIS HORSE IN THE YARDTO AVOID MAKING A NOISE ON THE GRAVEL IN FRONT AND ENTERED THE PARLORWITHOUT OTHER NOTICE THAN THE NOISE OF THE DOORHANDLE. MARY WAS IN HERUSUAL CORNER LAUGHING OVER MRS. PIOZZIS RECOLLECTIONS OF JOHNSON ANDLOOKED UP WITH THE FUN STILL IN HER FACE. IT GRADUALLY FADED AS SHE SAWFRED APPROACH HER WITHOUT SPEAKING AND STAND BEFORE HER WITH HIS ELBOWON THE MANTELPIECE LOOKING ILL. SHE TOO WAS SILENT ONLY RAISING HEREYES TO HIM INQUIRINGLY.MARY HE BEGAN I AM A GOODFORNOTHING BLACKGUARD.I SHOULD THINK ONE OF THOSE EPITHETS WOULD DO AT A TIME SAID MARYTRYING TO SMILE BUT FEELING ALARMED.I KNOW YOU WILL NEVER THINK WELL OF ME ANY MORE. YOU WILL THINK ME ALIAR. YOU WILL THINK ME DISHONEST. YOU WILL THINK I DIDNT CARE FORYOU OR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER. YOU ALWAYS DO MAKE THE WORST OF ME IKNOW.I CANNOT DENY THAT I SHALL THINK ALL THAT OF YOU FRED IF YOU GIVE MEGOOD REASONS. BUT PLEASE TO TELL ME AT ONCE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. I WOULDRATHER KNOW THE PAINFUL TRUTH THAN IMAGINE IT.I OWED MONEYA HUNDRED AND SIXTY POUNDS. I ASKED YOUR FATHER TO PUTHIS NAME TO A BILL. I THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT SIGNIFY TO HIM. I MADE SUREOF PAYING THE MONEY MYSELF AND I HAVE TRIED AS HARD AS I COULD. ANDNOW I HAVE BEEN SO UNLUCKYA HORSE HAS TURNED OUT BADLYI CAN ONLY PAYFIFTY POUNDS. AND I CANT ASK MY FATHER FOR THE MONEY HE WOULD NOTGIVE ME A FARTHING. AND MY UNCLE GAVE ME A HUNDRED A LITTLE WHILE AGO.SO WHAT CAN I DO AND NOW YOUR FATHER HAS NO READY MONEY TO SPARE ANDYOUR MOTHER WILL HAVE TO PAY AWAY HER NINETYTWO POUNDS THAT SHE HASSAVED AND SHE SAYS YOUR SAVINGS MUST GO TOO. YOU SEE WHAT AOH POOR MOTHER POOR FATHER SAID MARY HER EYES FILLING WITH TEARSAND A LITTLE SOB RISING WHICH SHE TRIED TO REPRESS. SHE LOOKED STRAIGHTBEFORE HER AND TOOK NO NOTICE OF FRED ALL THE CONSEQUENCES AT HOMEBECOMING PRESENT TO HER. HE TOO REMAINED SILENT FOR SOME MOMENTSFEELING MORE MISERABLE THAN EVER. I WOULDNT HAVE HURT YOU FOR THEWORLD MARY HE SAID AT LAST. YOU CAN NEVER FORGIVE ME.WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHETHER I FORGIVE YOU SAID MARY PASSIONATELY.WOULD THAT MAKE IT ANY BETTER FOR MY MOTHER TO LOSE THE MONEY SHE HASBEEN EARNING BY LESSONS FOR FOUR YEARS THAT SHE MIGHT SEND ALFRED TOMR. HANMERS SHOULD YOU THINK ALL THAT PLEASANT ENOUGH IF I FORGAVEYOUSAY WHAT YOU LIKE MARY. I DESERVE IT ALL.I DONT WANT TO SAY ANYTHING SAID MARY MORE QUIETLY AND MY ANGERIS OF NO USE. SHE DRIED HER EYES THREW ASIDE HER BOOK ROSE ANDFETCHED HER SEWING.FRED FOLLOWED HER WITH HIS EYES HOPING THAT THEY WOULD MEET HERS ANDIN THAT WAY FIND ACCESS FOR HIS IMPLORING PENITENCE. BUT NO MARY COULDEASILY AVOID LOOKING UPWARD.I DO CARE ABOUT YOUR MOTHERS MONEY GOING HE SAID WHEN SHE WASSEATED AGAIN AND SEWING QUICKLY. I WANTED TO ASK YOU MARYDONT YOUTHINK THAT MR. FEATHERSTONEIF YOU WERE TO TELL HIMTELL HIM I MEANABOUT APPRENTICING ALFREDWOULD ADVANCE THE MONEYMY FAMILY IS NOT FOND OF BEGGING FRED. WE WOULD RATHER WORK FOR OURMONEY. BESIDES YOU SAY THAT MR. FEATHERSTONE HAS LATELY GIVEN YOU AHUNDRED POUNDS. HE RARELY MAKES PRESENTS HE HAS NEVER MADE PRESENTS TOUS. I AM SURE MY FATHER WILL NOT ASK HIM FOR ANYTHING AND EVEN IF ICHOSE TO BEG OF HIM IT WOULD BE OF NO USE.I AM SO MISERABLE MARYIF YOU KNEW HOW MISERABLE I AM YOU WOULD BESORRY FOR ME.THERE ARE OTHER THINGS TO BE MORE SORRY FOR THAN THAT. BUT SELFISHPEOPLE ALWAYS THINK THEIR OWN DISCOMFORT OF MORE IMPORTANCE THANANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD. I SEE ENOUGH OF THAT EVERY DAY.IT IS HARDLY FAIR TO CALL ME SELFISH. IF YOU KNEW WHAT THINGS OTHERYOUNG MEN DO YOU WOULD THINK ME A GOOD WAY OFF THE WORST.I KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY ON THEMSELVESWITHOUT KNOWING HOW THEY SHALL PAY MUST BE SELFISH. THEY ARE ALWAYSTHINKING OF WHAT THEY CAN GET FOR THEMSELVES AND NOT OF WHAT OTHERPEOPLE MAY LOSE.ANY MAN MAY BE UNFORTUNATE MARY AND FIND HIMSELF UNABLE TO PAY WHENHE MEANT IT. THERE IS NOT A BETTER MAN IN THE WORLD THAN YOUR FATHERAND YET HE GOT INTO TROUBLE.HOW DARE YOU MAKE ANY COMPARISON BETWEEN MY FATHER AND YOU FREDSAID MARY IN A DEEP TONE OF INDIGNATION. HE NEVER GOT INTO TROUBLE BYTHINKING OF HIS OWN IDLE PLEASURES BUT BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS THINKINGOF THE WORK HE WAS DOING FOR OTHER PEOPLE. AND HE HAS FARED HARD ANDWORKED HARD TO MAKE GOOD EVERYBODYS LOSS.AND YOU THINK THAT I SHALL NEVER TRY TO MAKE GOOD ANYTHING MARY. ITIS NOT GENEROUS TO BELIEVE THE WORST OF A MAN. WHEN YOU HAVE GOT ANYPOWER OVER HIM I THINK YOU MIGHT TRY AND USE IT TO MAKE HIM BETTERBUT THAT IS WHAT YOU NEVER DO. HOWEVER IM GOING FRED ENDEDLANGUIDLY. I SHALL NEVER SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT ANYTHING AGAIN. IM VERYSORRY FOR ALL THE TROUBLE IVE CAUSEDTHATS ALL.MARY HAD DROPPED HER WORK OUT OF HER HAND AND LOOKED UP. THERE IS OFTENSOMETHING MATERNAL EVEN IN A GIRLISH LOVE AND MARYS HARD EXPERIENCEHAD WROUGHT HER NATURE TO AN IMPRESSIBILITY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THATHARD SLIGHT THING WHICH WE CALL GIRLISHNESS. AT FREDS LAST WORDS SHEFELT AN INSTANTANEOUS PANG SOMETHING LIKE WHAT A MOTHER FEELS AT THEIMAGINED SOBS OR CRIES OF HER NAUGHTY TRUANT CHILD WHICH MAY LOSEITSELF AND GET HARM. AND WHEN LOOKING UP HER EYES MET HIS DULLDESPAIRING GLANCE HER PITY FOR HIM SURMOUNTED HER ANGER AND ALL HEROTHER ANXIETIES.OH FRED HOW ILL YOU LOOK SIT DOWN A MOMENT. DONT GO YET. LET METELL UNCLE THAT YOU ARE HERE. HE HAS BEEN WONDERING THAT HE HAS NOTSEEN YOU FOR A WHOLE WEEK. MARY SPOKE HURRIEDLY SAYING THE WORDS THATCAME FIRST WITHOUT KNOWING VERY WELL WHAT THEY WERE BUT SAYING THEM INA HALFSOOTHING HALFBESEECHING TONE AND RISING AS IF TO GO AWAY TOMR. FEATHERSTONE. OF COURSE FRED FELT AS IF THE CLOUDS HAD PARTED AND AGLEAM HAD COME HE MOVED AND STOOD IN HER WAY.SAY ONE WORD MARY AND I WILL DO ANYTHING. SAY YOU WILL NOT THINK THEWORST OF MEWILL NOT GIVE ME UP ALTOGETHER.AS IF IT WERE ANY PLEASURE TO ME TO THINK ILL OF YOU SAID MARY IN AMOURNFUL TONE. AS IF IT WERE NOT VERY PAINFUL TO ME TO SEE YOU AN IDLEFRIVOLOUS CREATURE. HOW CAN YOU BEAR TO BE SO CONTEMPTIBLE WHEN OTHERSARE WORKING AND STRIVING AND THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO BE DONEHOWCAN YOU BEAR TO BE FIT FOR NOTHING IN THE WORLD THAT IS USEFUL ANDWITH SO MUCH GOOD IN YOUR DISPOSITION FREDYOU MIGHT BE WORTH A GREATDEAL.I WILL TRY TO BE ANYTHING YOU LIKE MARY IF YOU WILL SAY THAT YOULOVE ME.I SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO SAY THAT I LOVED A MAN WHO MUST ALWAYS BEHANGING ON OTHERS AND RECKONING ON WHAT THEY WOULD DO FOR HIM. WHATWILL YOU BE WHEN YOU ARE FORTY LIKE MR. BOWYER I SUPPOSEJUST ASIDLE LIVING IN MRS. BECKS FRONT PARLORFAT AND SHABBY HOPINGSOMEBODY WILL INVITE YOU TO DINNERSPENDING YOUR MORNING IN LEARNING ACOMIC SONGOH NO LEARNING A TUNE ON THE FLUTE.MARYS LIPS HAD BEGUN TO CURL WITH A SMILE AS SOON AS SHE HAD ASKEDTHAT QUESTION ABOUT FREDS FUTURE YOUNG SOULS ARE MOBILE AND BEFORESHE ENDED HER FACE HAD ITS FULL ILLUMINATION OF FUN. TO HIM IT WASLIKE THE CESSATION OF AN ACHE THAT MARY COULD LAUGH AT HIM AND WITH APASSIVE SORT OF SMILE HE TRIED TO REACH HER HAND BUT SHE SLIPPED AWAYQUICKLY TOWARDS THE DOOR AND SAID I SHALL TELL UNCLE. YOU MUST SEEHIM FOR A MOMENT OR TWO.FRED SECRETLY FELT THAT HIS FUTURE WAS GUARANTEED AGAINST THEFULFILMENT OF MARYS SARCASTIC PROPHECIES APART FROM THAT ANYTHINGWHICH HE WAS READY TO DO IF SHE WOULD DEFINE IT. HE NEVER DARED INMARYS PRESENCE TO APPROACH THE SUBJECT OF HIS EXPECTATIONS FROM MR.FEATHERSTONE AND SHE ALWAYS IGNORED THEM AS IF EVERYTHING DEPENDED ONHIMSELF. BUT IF EVER HE ACTUALLY CAME INTO THE PROPERTY SHE MUSTRECOGNIZE THE CHANGE IN HIS POSITION. ALL THIS PASSED THROUGH HIS MINDSOMEWHAT LANGUIDLY BEFORE HE WENT UP TO SEE HIS UNCLE. HE STAYED BUT ALITTLE WHILE EXCUSING HIMSELF ON THE GROUND THAT HE HAD A COLD ANDMARY DID NOT REAPPEAR BEFORE HE LEFT THE HOUSE. BUT AS HE RODE HOME HEBEGAN TO BE MORE CONSCIOUS OF BEING ILL THAN OF BEING MELANCHOLY.WHEN CALEB GARTH ARRIVED AT STONE COURT SOON AFTER DUSK MARY WAS NOTSURPRISED ALTHOUGH HE SELDOM HAD LEISURE FOR PAYING HER A VISIT ANDWAS NOT AT ALL FOND OF HAVING TO TALK WITH MR. FEATHERSTONE. THE OLDMAN ON THE OTHER HAND FELT HIMSELF ILL AT EASE WITH A BROTHERINLAWWHOM HE COULD NOT ANNOY WHO DID NOT MIND ABOUT BEING CONSIDERED POORHAD NOTHING TO ASK OF HIM AND UNDERSTOOD ALL KINDS OF FARMING ANDMINING BUSINESS BETTER THAN HE DID. BUT MARY HAD FELT SURE THAT HERPARENTS WOULD WANT TO SEE HER AND IF HER FATHER HAD NOT COME SHEWOULD HAVE OBTAINED LEAVE TO GO HOME FOR AN HOUR OR TWO THE NEXT DAY.AFTER DISCUSSING PRICES DURING TEA WITH MR. FEATHERSTONE CALEB ROSE TOBID HIM GOODBY AND SAID I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU MARY.SHE TOOK A CANDLE INTO ANOTHER LARGE PARLOR WHERE THERE WAS NO FIREAND SETTING DOWN THE FEEBLE LIGHT ON THE DARK MAHOGANY TABLE TURNEDROUND TO HER FATHER AND PUTTING HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK KISSED HIMWITH CHILDISH KISSES WHICH HE DELIGHTED INTHE EXPRESSION OF HIS LARGEBROWS SOFTENING AS THE EXPRESSION OF A GREAT BEAUTIFUL DOG SOFTENS WHENIT IS CARESSED. MARY WAS HIS FAVORITE CHILD AND WHATEVER SUSAN MIGHTSAY AND RIGHT AS SHE WAS ON ALL OTHER SUBJECTS CALEB THOUGHT ITNATURAL THAT FRED OR ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD THINK MARY MORE LOVABLE THANOTHER GIRLS.IVE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU MY DEAR SAID CALEB IN HIS HESITATINGWAY. NO VERY GOOD NEWS BUT THEN IT MIGHT BE WORSE.ABOUT MONEY FATHER I THINK I KNOW WHAT IT IS.AY HOW CAN THAT BE YOU SEE IVE BEEN A BIT OF A FOOL AGAIN AND PUTMY NAME TO A BILL AND NOW IT COMES TO PAYING AND YOUR MOTHER HAS GOTTO PART WITH HER SAVINGS THATS THE WORST OF IT AND EVEN THEY WONTQUITE MAKE THINGS EVEN. WE WANTED A HUNDRED AND TEN POUNDS YOUR MOTHERHAS NINETYTWO AND I HAVE NONE TO SPARE IN THE BANK AND SHE THINKSTHAT YOU HAVE SOME SAVINGS.OH YES I HAVE MORE THAN FOURANDTWENTY POUNDS. I THOUGHT YOU WOULDCOME FATHER SO I PUT IT IN MY BAG. SEE BEAUTIFUL WHITE NOTES ANDGOLD.MARY TOOK OUT THE FOLDED MONEY FROM HER RETICULE AND PUT IT INTO HERFATHERS HAND.WELL BUT HOWWE ONLY WANT EIGHTEENHERE PUT THE REST BACKCHILDBUT HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT IT SAID CALEB WHO IN HISUNCONQUERABLE INDIFFERENCE TO MONEY WAS BEGINNING TO BE CHIEFLYCONCERNED ABOUT THE RELATION THE AFFAIR MIGHT HAVE TO MARYSAFFECTIONS.FRED TOLD ME THIS MORNING.AH DID HE COME ON PURPOSEYES I THINK SO. HE WAS A GOOD DEAL DISTRESSED.IM AFRAID FRED IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED MARY SAID THE FATHER WITHHESITATING TENDERNESS. HE MEANS BETTER THAN HE ACTS PERHAPS. BUT ISHOULD THINK IT A PITY FOR ANY BODYS HAPPINESS TO BE WRAPPED UP INHIM AND SO WOULD YOUR MOTHER.AND SO SHOULD I FATHER SAID MARY NOT LOOKING UP BUT PUTTING THEBACK OF HER FATHERS HAND AGAINST HER CHEEK.I DONT WANT TO PRY MY DEAR. BUT I WAS AFRAID THERE MIGHT BESOMETHING BETWEEN YOU AND FRED AND I WANTED TO CAUTION YOU. YOU SEEMARYHERE CALEBS VOICE BECAME MORE TENDER HE HAD BEEN PUSHING HISHAT ABOUT ON THE TABLE AND LOOKING AT IT BUT FINALLY HE TURNED HISEYES ON HIS DAUGHTERA WOMAN LET HER BE AS GOOD AS SHE MAY HAS GOTTO PUT UP WITH THE LIFE HER HUSBAND MAKES FOR HER. YOUR MOTHER HAS HADTO PUT UP WITH A GOOD DEAL BECAUSE OF ME.MARY TURNED THE BACK OF HER FATHERS HAND TO HER LIPS AND SMILED ATHIM.WELL WELL NOBODYS PERFECT BUTHERE MR. GARTH SHOOK HIS HEAD TOHELP OUT THE INADEQUACY OF WORDSWHAT I AM THINKING OF ISWHAT IT MUSTBE FOR A WIFE WHEN SHES NEVER SURE OF HER HUSBAND WHEN HE HASNT GOTA PRINCIPLE IN HIM TO MAKE HIM MORE AFRAID OF DOING THE WRONG THING BYOTHERS THAN OF GETTING HIS OWN TOES PINCHED. THATS THE LONG AND THESHORT OF IT MARY. YOUNG FOLKS MAY GET FOND OF EACH OTHER BEFORE THEYKNOW WHAT LIFE IS AND THEY MAY THINK IT ALL HOLIDAY IF THEY CAN ONLYGET TOGETHER BUT IT SOON TURNS INTO WORKING DAY MY DEAR. HOWEVER YOUHAVE MORE SENSE THAN MOST AND YOU HAVENT BEEN KEPT IN COTTONWOOLTHERE MAY BE NO OCCASION FOR ME TO SAY THIS BUT A FATHER TREMBLES FORHIS DAUGHTER AND YOU ARE ALL BY YOURSELF HERE.DONT FEAR FOR ME FATHER SAID MARY GRAVELY MEETING HER FATHERSEYES FRED HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME HE IS KINDHEARTED ANDAFFECTIONATE AND NOT FALSE I THINK WITH ALL HIS SELFINDULGENCE. BUTI WILL NEVER ENGAGE MYSELF TO ONE WHO HAS NO MANLY INDEPENDENCE ANDWHO GOES ON LOITERING AWAY HIS TIME ON THE CHANCE THAT OTHERS WILLPROVIDE FOR HIM. YOU AND MY MOTHER HAVE TAUGHT ME TOO MUCH PRIDE FORTHAT.THATS RIGHTTHATS RIGHT. THEN I AM EASY SAID MR. GARTH TAKING UPHIS HAT. BUT ITS HARD TO RUN AWAY WITH YOUR EARNINGS EH CHILD.FATHER SAID MARY IN HER DEEPEST TONE OF REMONSTRANCE. TAKEPOCKETFULS OF LOVE BESIDES TO THEM ALL AT HOME WAS HER LAST WORDBEFORE HE CLOSED THE OUTER DOOR ON HIMSELF.I SUPPOSE YOUR FATHER WANTED YOUR EARNINGS SAID OLD MR.FEATHERSTONE WITH HIS USUAL POWER OF UNPLEASANT SURMISE WHEN MARYRETURNED TO HIM. HE MAKES BUT A TIGHT FIT I RECKON. YOURE OF AGENOW YOU OUGHT TO BE SAVING FOR YOURSELF.I CONSIDER MY FATHER AND MOTHER THE BEST PART OF MYSELF SIR SAIDMARY COLDLY.MR. FEATHERSTONE GRUNTED HE COULD NOT DENY THAT AN ORDINARY SORT OFGIRL LIKE HER MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO BE USEFUL SO HE THOUGHT OF ANOTHERREJOINDER DISAGREEABLE ENOUGH TO BE ALWAYS APROPOS. IF FRED VINCYCOMES TOMORROW NOW DONT YOU KEEP HIM CHATTERING LET HIM COME UP TOME.CHAPTER XXVI.HE BEATS ME AND I RAIL AT HIM O WORTHY SATISFACTION WOULD IT WEREOTHERWISETHAT I COULD BEAT HIM WHILE HE RAILED AT ME.TROILUS ANDCRESSIDA.BUT FRED DID NOT GO TO STONE COURT THE NEXT DAY FOR REASONS THAT WEREQUITE PEREMPTORY. FROM THOSE VISITS TO UNSANITARY HOUNDSLEY STREETS INSEARCH OF DIAMOND HE HAD BROUGHT BACK NOT ONLY A BAD BARGAIN INHORSEFLESH BUT THE FURTHER MISFORTUNE OF SOME AILMENT WHICH FOR A DAYOR TWO HAD DEEMED MERE DEPRESSION AND HEADACHE BUT WHICH GOT SO MUCHWORSE WHEN HE RETURNED FROM HIS VISIT TO STONE COURT THAT GOING INTOTHE DININGROOM HE THREW HIMSELF ON THE SOFA AND IN ANSWER TO HISMOTHERS ANXIOUS QUESTION SAID I FEEL VERY ILL I THINK YOU MUSTSEND FOR WRENCH.WRENCH CAME BUT DID NOT APPREHEND ANYTHING SERIOUS SPOKE OF A SLIGHTDERANGEMENT AND DID NOT SPEAK OF COMING AGAIN ON THE MORROW. HE HAD ADUE VALUE FOR THE VINCYS HOUSE BUT THE WARIEST MEN ARE APT TO BEDULLED BY ROUTINE AND ON WORRIED MORNINGS WILL SOMETIMES GO THROUGHTHEIR BUSINESS WITH THE ZEST OF THE DAILY BELLRINGER. MR. WRENCH WAS ASMALL NEAT BILIOUS MAN WITH A WELLDRESSED WIG HE HAD A LABORIOUSPRACTICE AN IRASCIBLE TEMPER A LYMPHATIC WIFE AND SEVEN CHILDREN ANDHE WAS ALREADY RATHER LATE BEFORE SETTING OUT ON A FOURMILES DRIVE TOMEET DR. MINCHIN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TIPTON THE DECEASE OF HICKS ARURAL PRACTITIONER HAVING INCREASED MIDDLEMARCH PRACTICE IN THATDIRECTION. GREAT STATESMEN ERR AND WHY NOT SMALL MEDICAL MEN MR.WRENCH DID NOT NEGLECT SENDING THE USUAL WHITE PARCELS WHICH THIS TIMEHAD BLACK AND DRASTIC CONTENTS. THEIR EFFECT WAS NOT ALLEVIATING TOPOOR FRED WHO HOWEVER UNWILLING AS HE SAID TO BELIEVE THAT HE WASIN FOR AN ILLNESS ROSE AT HIS USUAL EASY HOUR THE NEXT MORNING ANDWENT DOWNSTAIRS MEANING TO BREAKFAST BUT SUCCEEDED IN NOTHING BUT INSITTING AND SHIVERING BY THE FIRE. MR. WRENCH WAS AGAIN SENT FOR BUTWAS GONE ON HIS ROUNDS AND MRS. VINCY SEEING HER DARLINGS CHANGEDLOOKS AND GENERAL MISERY BEGAN TO CRY AND SAID SHE WOULD SEND FOR DR.SPRAGUE.OH NONSENSE MOTHER ITS NOTHING SAID FRED PUTTING OUT HIS HOTDRY HAND TO HER I SHALL SOON BE ALL RIGHT. I MUST HAVE TAKEN COLD INTHAT NASTY DAMP RIDE.MAMMA SAID ROSAMOND WHO WAS SEATED NEAR THE WINDOW THE DININGROOMWINDOWS LOOKED ON THAT HIGHLY RESPECTABLE STREET CALLED LOWICK GATETHERE IS MR. LYDGATE STOPPING TO SPEAK TO SOME ONE. IF I WERE YOU IWOULD CALL HIM IN. HE HAS CURED ELLEN BULSTRODE. THEY SAY HE CURESEVERY ONE.MRS. VINCY SPRANG TO THE WINDOW AND OPENED IT IN AN INSTANT THINKINGONLY OF FRED AND NOT OF MEDICAL ETIQUETTE. LYDGATE WAS ONLY TWO YARDSOFF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF SOME IRON PALISADING AND TURNED ROUND AT THESUDDEN SOUND OF THE SASH BEFORE SHE CALLED TO HIM. IN TWO MINUTES HEWAS IN THE ROOM AND ROSAMOND WENT OUT AFTER WAITING JUST LONG ENOUGHTO SHOW A PRETTY ANXIETY CONFLICTING WITH HER SENSE OF WHAT WASBECOMING.LYDGATE HAD TO HEAR A NARRATIVE IN WHICH MRS. VINCYS MIND INSISTEDWITH REMARKABLE INSTINCT ON EVERY POINT OF MINOR IMPORTANCE ESPECIALLYON WHAT MR. WRENCH HAD SAID AND HAD NOT SAID ABOUT COMING AGAIN. THATTHERE MIGHT BE AN AWKWARD AFFAIR WITH WRENCH LYDGATE SAW AT ONCE BUTTHE CASE WAS SERIOUS ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM DISMISS THAT CONSIDERATION HEWAS CONVINCED THAT FRED WAS IN THE PINKSKINNED STAGE OF TYPHOID FEVERAND THAT HE HAD TAKEN JUST THE WRONG MEDICINES. HE MUST GO TO BEDIMMEDIATELY MUST HAVE A REGULAR NURSE AND VARIOUS APPLIANCES ANDPRECAUTIONS MUST BE USED ABOUT WHICH LYDGATE WAS PARTICULAR. POOR MRS.VINCYS TERROR AT THESE INDICATIONS OF DANGER FOUND VENT IN SUCH WORDSAS CAME MOST EASILY. SHE THOUGHT IT VERY ILL USAGE ON THE PART OF MR.WRENCH WHO HAD ATTENDED THEIR HOUSE SO MANY YEARS IN PREFERENCE TO MR.PEACOCK THOUGH MR. PEACOCK WAS EQUALLY A FRIEND. WHY MR. WRENCH SHOULDNEGLECT HER CHILDREN MORE THAN OTHERS SHE COULD NOT FOR THE LIFE OFHER UNDERSTAND. HE HAD NOT NEGLECTED MRS. LARCHERS WHEN THEY HAD THEMEASLES NOR INDEED WOULD MRS. VINCY HAVE WISHED THAT HE SHOULD. AND IFANYTHING SHOULD HAPPENHERE POOR MRS. VINCYS SPIRIT QUITE BROKE DOWN AND HER NIOBE THROATAND GOODHUMORED FACE WERE SADLY CONVULSED. THIS WAS IN THE HALL OUT OFFREDS HEARING BUT ROSAMOND HAD OPENED THE DRAWINGROOM DOOR AND NOWCAME FORWARD ANXIOUSLY. LYDGATE APOLOGIZED FOR MR. WRENCH SAID THATTHE SYMPTOMS YESTERDAY MIGHT HAVE BEEN DISGUISING AND THAT THIS FORMOF FEVER WAS VERY EQUIVOCAL IN ITS BEGINNINGS HE WOULD GO IMMEDIATELYTO THE DRUGGISTS AND HAVE A PRESCRIPTION MADE UP IN ORDER TO LOSE NOTIME BUT HE WOULD WRITE TO MR. WRENCH AND TELL HIM WHAT HAD BEEN DONE.BUT YOU MUST COME AGAINYOU MUST GO ON ATTENDING FRED. I CANT HAVE MYBOY LEFT TO ANYBODY WHO MAY COME OR NOT. I BEAR NOBODY ILLWILL THANKGOD AND MR. WRENCH SAVED ME IN THE PLEURISY BUT HED BETTER HAVE LETME DIEIFIFI WILL MEET MR. WRENCH HERE THEN SHALL I SAID LYDGATE REALLYBELIEVING THAT WRENCH WAS NOT WELL PREPARED TO DEAL WISELY WITH A CASEOF THIS KIND.PRAY MAKE THAT ARRANGEMENT MR. LYDGATE SAID ROSAMOND COMING TO HERMOTHERS AID AND SUPPORTING HER ARM TO LEAD HER AWAY.WHEN MR. VINCY CAME HOME HE WAS VERY ANGRY WITH WRENCH AND DID NOTCARE IF HE NEVER CAME INTO HIS HOUSE AGAIN. LYDGATE SHOULD GO ON NOWWHETHER WRENCH LIKED IT OR NOT. IT WAS NO JOKE TO HAVE FEVER IN THEHOUSE. EVERYBODY MUST BE SENT TO NOW NOT TO COME TO DINNER ONTHURSDAY. AND PRITCHARD NEEDNT GET UP ANY WINE BRANDY WAS THE BESTTHING AGAINST INFECTION. I SHALL DRINK BRANDY ADDED MR. VINCYEMPHATICALLYAS MUCH AS TO SAY THIS WAS NOT AN OCCASION FOR FIRINGWITH BLANKCARTRIDGES. HES AN UNCOMMONLY UNFORTUNATE LAD IS FRED.HED NEED HAVE SOME LUCK BY AND BY TO MAKE UP FOR ALL THISELSE I DONTKNOW WHOD HAVE AN ELDEST SON.DONT SAY SO VINCY SAID THE MOTHER WITH A QUIVERING LIP IF YOUDONT WANT HIM TO BE TAKEN FROM ME.IT WILL WORRET YOU TO DEATH LUCY THAT I CAN SEE SAID MR. VINCYMORE MILDLY. HOWEVER WRENCH SHALL KNOW WHAT I THINK OF THE MATTER.WHAT MR. VINCY THOUGHT CONFUSEDLY WAS THAT THE FEVER MIGHT SOMEHOWHAVE BEEN HINDERED IF WRENCH HAD SHOWN THE PROPER SOLICITUDE ABOUTHISTHE MAYORSFAMILY. IM THE LAST MAN TO GIVE IN TO THE CRY ABOUTNEW DOCTORS OR NEW PARSONS EITHERWHETHER THEYRE BULSTRODES MEN ORNOT. BUT WRENCH SHALL KNOW WHAT I THINK TAKE IT AS HE WILL.WRENCH DID NOT TAKE IT AT ALL WELL. LYDGATE WAS AS POLITE AS HE COULDBE IN HIS OFFHAND WAY BUT POLITENESS IN A MAN WHO HAS PLACED YOU AT ADISADVANTAGE IS ONLY AN ADDITIONAL EXASPERATION ESPECIALLY IF HEHAPPENS TO HAVE BEEN AN OBJECT OF DISLIKE BEFOREHAND. COUNTRYPRACTITIONERS USED TO BE AN IRRITABLE SPECIES SUSCEPTIBLE ON THE POINTOF HONOR AND MR. WRENCH WAS ONE OF THE MOST IRRITABLE AMONG THEM. HEDID NOT REFUSE TO MEET LYDGATE IN THE EVENING BUT HIS TEMPER WASSOMEWHAT TRIED ON THE OCCASION. HE HAD TO HEAR MRS. VINCY SAYOH MR. WRENCH WHAT HAVE I EVER DONE THAT YOU SHOULD USE ME SO TOGO AWAY AND NEVER TO COME AGAIN AND MY BOY MIGHT HAVE BEEN STRETCHEDA CORPSEMR. VINCY WHO HAD BEEN KEEPING UP A SHARP FIRE ON THE ENEMY INFECTIONAND WAS A GOOD DEAL HEATED IN CONSEQUENCE STARTED UP WHEN HE HEARDWRENCH COME IN AND WENT INTO THE HALL TO LET HIM KNOW WHAT HE THOUGHT.ILL TELL YOU WHAT WRENCH THIS IS BEYOND A JOKE SAID THE MAYORWHO OF LATE HAD HAD TO REBUKE OFFENDERS WITH AN OFFICIAL AIR AND NOWBROADENED HIMSELF BY PUTTING HIS THUMBS IN HIS ARMHOLES. TO LET FEVERGET UNAWARES INTO A HOUSE LIKE THIS. THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT OUGHTTO BE ACTIONABLE AND ARE NOT SO THATS MY OPINION.BUT IRRATIONAL REPROACHES WERE EASIER TO BEAR THAN THE SENSE OF BEINGINSTRUCTED OR RATHER THE SENSE THAT A YOUNGER MAN LIKE LYDGATEINWARDLY CONSIDERED HIM IN NEED OF INSTRUCTION FOR IN POINT OF FACTMR. WRENCH AFTERWARDS SAID LYDGATE PARADED FLIGHTY FOREIGN NOTIONSWHICH WOULD NOT WEAR. HE SWALLOWED HIS IRE FOR THE MOMENT BUT HEAFTERWARDS WROTE TO DECLINE FURTHER ATTENDANCE IN THE CASE. THE HOUSEMIGHT BE A GOOD ONE BUT MR. WRENCH WAS NOT GOING TO TRUCKLE TO ANYBODYON A PROFESSIONAL MATTER. HE REFLECTED WITH MUCH PROBABILITY ON HISSIDE THAT LYDGATE WOULD BYANDBY BE CAUGHT TRIPPING TOO AND THAT HISUNGENTLEMANLY ATTEMPTS TO DISCREDIT THE SALE OF DRUGS BY HISPROFESSIONAL BRETHREN WOULD BYANDBY RECOIL ON HIMSELF. HE THREW OUTBITING REMARKS ON LYDGATES TRICKS WORTHY ONLY OF A QUACK TO GETHIMSELF A FACTITIOUS REPUTATION WITH CREDULOUS PEOPLE. THAT CANT ABOUTCURES WAS NEVER GOT UP BY SOUND PRACTITIONERS.THIS WAS A POINT ON WHICH LYDGATE SMARTED AS MUCH AS WRENCH COULDDESIRE. TO BE PUFFED BY IGNORANCE WAS NOT ONLY HUMILIATING BUTPERILOUS AND NOT MORE ENVIABLE THAN THE REPUTATION OF THEWEATHERPROPHET. HE WAS IMPATIENT OF THE FOOLISH EXPECTATIONS AMIDSTWHICH ALL WORK MUST BE CARRIED ON AND LIKELY ENOUGH TO DAMAGE HIMSELFAS MUCH AS MR. WRENCH COULD WISH BY AN UNPROFESSIONAL OPENNESS.HOWEVER LYDGATE WAS INSTALLED AS MEDICAL ATTENDANT ON THE VINCYS ANDTHE EVENT WAS A SUBJECT OF GENERAL CONVERSATION IN MIDDLEMARCH. SOMESAID THAT THE VINCYS HAD BEHAVED SCANDALOUSLY THAT MR. VINCY HADTHREATENED WRENCH AND THAT MRS. VINCY HAD ACCUSED HIM OF POISONING HERSON. OTHERS WERE OF OPINION THAT MR. LYDGATES PASSING BY WASPROVIDENTIAL THAT HE WAS WONDERFULLY CLEVER IN FEVERS AND THATBULSTRODE WAS IN THE RIGHT TO BRING HIM FORWARD. MANY PEOPLE BELIEVEDTHAT LYDGATES COMING TO THE TOWN AT ALL WAS REALLY DUE TO BULSTRODEAND MRS. TAFT WHO WAS ALWAYS COUNTING STITCHES AND GATHERED HERINFORMATION IN MISLEADING FRAGMENTS CAUGHT BETWEEN THE ROWS OF HERKNITTING HAD GOT IT INTO HER HEAD THAT MR. LYDGATE WAS A NATURAL SONOF BULSTRODES A FACT WHICH SEEMED TO JUSTIFY HER SUSPICIONS OFEVANGELICAL LAYMEN.SHE ONE DAY COMMUNICATED THIS PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE TO MRS. FAREBROTHERWHO DID NOT FAIL TO TELL HER SON OF IT OBSERVINGI SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING IN BULSTRODE BUT I SHOULD BESORRY TO THINK IT OF MR. LYDGATE.WHY MOTHER SAID MR. FAREBROTHER AFTER AN EXPLOSIVE LAUGH YOUKNOW VERY WELL THAT LYDGATE IS OF A GOOD FAMILY IN THE NORTH. HE NEVERHEARD OF BULSTRODE BEFORE HE CAME HERE.THAT IS SATISFACTORY SO FAR AS MR. LYDGATE IS CONCERNED CAMDEN SAIDTHE OLD LADY WITH AN AIR OF PRECISION.BUT AS TO BULSTRODETHE REPORTMAY BE TRUE OF SOME OTHER SON.CHAPTER XXVII.LET THE HIGH MUSE CHANT LOVES OLYMPIANWE ARE BUT MORTALS AND MUST SING OF MAN.AN EMINENT PHILOSOPHER AMONG MY FRIENDS WHO CAN DIGNIFY EVEN YOUR UGLYFURNITURE BY LIFTING IT INTO THE SERENE LIGHT OF SCIENCE HAS SHOWN METHIS PREGNANT LITTLE FACT. YOUR PIERGLASS OR EXTENSIVE SURFACE OFPOLISHED STEEL MADE TO BE RUBBED BY A HOUSEMAID WILL BE MINUTELY ANDMULTITUDINOUSLY SCRATCHED IN ALL DIRECTIONS BUT PLACE NOW AGAINST IT ALIGHTED CANDLE AS A CENTRE OF ILLUMINATION AND LO THE SCRATCHES WILLSEEM TO ARRANGE THEMSELVES IN A FINE SERIES OF CONCENTRIC CIRCLES ROUNDTHAT LITTLE SUN. IT IS DEMONSTRABLE THAT THE SCRATCHES ARE GOINGEVERYWHERE IMPARTIALLY AND IT IS ONLY YOUR CANDLE WHICH PRODUCES THEFLATTERING ILLUSION OF A CONCENTRIC ARRANGEMENT ITS LIGHT FALLING WITHAN EXCLUSIVE OPTICAL SELECTION. THESE THINGS ARE A PARABLE. THESCRATCHES ARE EVENTS AND THE CANDLE IS THE EGOISM OF ANY PERSON NOWABSENTOF MISS VINCY FOR EXAMPLE. ROSAMOND HAD A PROVIDENCE OF HER OWNWHO HAD KINDLY MADE HER MORE CHARMING THAN OTHER GIRLS AND WHO SEEMEDTO HAVE ARRANGED FREDS ILLNESS AND MR. WRENCHS MISTAKE IN ORDER TOBRING HER AND LYDGATE WITHIN EFFECTIVE PROXIMITY. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOCONTRAVENE THESE ARRANGEMENTS IF ROSAMOND HAD CONSENTED TO GO AWAY TOSTONE COURT OR ELSEWHERE AS HER PARENTS WISHED HER TO DO ESPECIALLYSINCE MR. LYDGATE THOUGHT THE PRECAUTION NEEDLESS. THEREFORE WHILEMISS MORGAN AND THE CHILDREN WERE SENT AWAY TO A FARMHOUSE THE MORNINGAFTER FREDS ILLNESS HAD DECLARED ITSELF ROSAMOND REFUSED TO LEAVEPAPA AND MAMMA.POOR MAMMA INDEED WAS AN OBJECT TO TOUCH ANY CREATURE BORN OF WOMANAND MR. VINCY WHO DOTED ON HIS WIFE WAS MORE ALARMED ON HER ACCOUNTTHAN ON FREDS. BUT FOR HIS INSISTENCE SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN NO RESTHER BRIGHTNESS WAS ALL BEDIMMED UNCONSCIOUS OF HER COSTUME WHICH HADALWAYS BEEN SO FRESH AND GAY SHE WAS LIKE A SICK BIRD WITH LANGUID EYEAND PLUMAGE RUFFLED HER SENSES DULLED TO THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS THATUSED MOST TO INTEREST HER. FREDS DELIRIUM IN WHICH HE SEEMED TO BEWANDERING OUT OF HER REACH TORE HER HEART. AFTER HER FIRST OUTBURSTAGAINST MR. WRENCH SHE WENT ABOUT VERY QUIETLY HER ONE LOW CRY WAS TOLYDGATE. SHE WOULD FOLLOW HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND PUT HER HAND ON HISARM MOANING OUT SAVE MY BOY. ONCE SHE PLEADED HE HAS ALWAYS BEENGOOD TO ME MR. LYDGATE HE NEVER HAD A HARD WORD FOR HIS MOTHERASIF POOR FREDS SUFFERING WERE AN ACCUSATION AGAINST HIM. ALL THEDEEPEST FIBRES OF THE MOTHERS MEMORY WERE STIRRED AND THE YOUNG MANWHOSE VOICE TOOK A GENTLER TONE WHEN HE SPOKE TO HER WAS ONE WITH THEBABE WHOM SHE HAD LOVED WITH A LOVE NEW TO HER BEFORE HE WAS BORN.I HAVE GOOD HOPE MRS. VINCY LYDGATE WOULD SAY. COME DOWN WITH MEAND LET US TALK ABOUT THE FOOD. IN THAT WAY HE LED HER TO THE PARLORWHERE ROSAMOND WAS AND MADE A CHANGE FOR HER SURPRISING HER INTOTAKING SOME TEA OR BROTH WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR HER. THERE WAS ACONSTANT UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN HIM AND ROSAMOND ON THESE MATTERS. HEALMOST ALWAYS SAW HER BEFORE GOING TO THE SICKROOM AND SHE APPEALED TOHIM AS TO WHAT SHE COULD DO FOR MAMMA. HER PRESENCE OF MIND ANDADROITNESS IN CARRYING OUT HIS HINTS WERE ADMIRABLE AND IT IS NOTWONDERFUL THAT THE IDEA OF SEEING ROSAMOND BEGAN TO MINGLE ITSELF WITHHIS INTEREST IN THE CASE. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE CRITICAL STAGE WASPASSED AND HE BEGAN TO FEEL CONFIDENT OF FREDS RECOVERY. IN THE MOREDOUBTFUL TIME HE HAD ADVISED CALLING IN DR. SPRAGUE WHO IF HE COULDWOULD RATHER HAVE REMAINED NEUTRAL ON WRENCHS ACCOUNT BUT AFTER TWOCONSULTATIONS THE CONDUCT OF THE CASE WAS LEFT TO LYDGATE AND THEREWAS EVERY REASON TO MAKE HIM ASSIDUOUS. MORNING AND EVENING HE WAS ATMR. VINCYS AND GRADUALLY THE VISITS BECAME CHEERFUL AS FRED BECAMESIMPLY FEEBLE AND LAY NOT ONLY IN NEED OF THE UTMOST PETTING BUTCONSCIOUS OF IT SO THAT MRS. VINCY FELT AS IF AFTER ALL THE ILLNESSHAD MADE A FESTIVAL FOR HER TENDERNESS.BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER HELD IT AN ADDED REASON FOR GOOD SPIRITS WHENOLD MR. FEATHERSTONE SENT MESSAGES BY LYDGATE SAYING THAT FRED MUSTMAKE HASTE AND GET WELL AS HE PETER FEATHERSTONE COULD NOT DOWITHOUT HIM AND MISSED HIS VISITS SADLY. THE OLD MAN HIMSELF WASGETTING BEDRIDDEN. MRS. VINCY TOLD THESE MESSAGES TO FRED WHEN HE COULDLISTEN AND HE TURNED TOWARDS HER HIS DELICATE PINCHED FACE FROMWHICH ALL THE THICK BLOND HAIR HAD BEEN CUT AWAY AND IN WHICH THE EYESSEEMED TO HAVE GOT LARGER YEARNING FOR SOME WORD ABOUT MARYWONDERINGWHAT SHE FELT ABOUT HIS ILLNESS. NO WORD PASSED HIS LIPS BUT TO HEARWITH EYES BELONGS TO LOVES RARE WIT AND THE MOTHER IN THE FULNESS OFHER HEART NOT ONLY DIVINED FREDS LONGING BUT FELT READY FOR ANYSACRIFICE IN ORDER TO SATISFY HIM.IF I CAN ONLY SEE MY BOY STRONG AGAIN SHE SAID IN HER LOVING FOLLYAND WHO KNOWSPERHAPS MASTER OF STONE COURT AND HE CAN MARRY ANYBODYHE LIKES THEN.NOT IF THEY WONT HAVE ME MOTHER SAID FRED. THE ILLNESS HAD MADEHIM CHILDISH AND TEARS CAME AS HE SPOKE.OH TAKE A BIT OF JELLY MY DEAR SAID MRS. VINCY SECRETLYINCREDULOUS OF ANY SUCH REFUSAL.SHE NEVER LEFT FREDS SIDE WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS NOT IN THE HOUSE ANDTHUS ROSAMOND WAS IN THE UNUSUAL POSITION OF BEING MUCH ALONE. LYDGATENATURALLY NEVER THOUGHT OF STAYING LONG WITH HER YET IT SEEMED THATTHE BRIEF IMPERSONAL CONVERSATIONS THEY HAD TOGETHER WERE CREATING THATPECULIAR INTIMACY WHICH CONSISTS IN SHYNESS. THEY WERE OBLIGED TO LOOKAT EACH OTHER IN SPEAKING AND SOMEHOW THE LOOKING COULD NOT BE CARRIEDTHROUGH AS THE MATTER OF COURSE WHICH IT REALLY WAS. LYDGATE BEGAN TOFEEL THIS SORT OF CONSCIOUSNESS UNPLEASANT AND ONE DAY LOOKED DOWN ORANYWHERE LIKE AN ILLWORKED PUPPET. BUT THIS TURNED OUT BADLY THENEXT DAY ROSAMOND LOOKED DOWN AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT WHEN THEIREYES MET AGAIN BOTH WERE MORE CONSCIOUS THAN BEFORE. THERE WAS NO HELPFOR THIS IN SCIENCE AND AS LYDGATE DID NOT WANT TO FLIRT THERE SEEMEDTO BE NO HELP FOR IT IN FOLLY. IT WAS THEREFORE A RELIEF WHEN NEIGHBORSNO LONGER CONSIDERED THE HOUSE IN QUARANTINE AND WHEN THE CHANCES OFSEEING ROSAMOND ALONE WERE VERY MUCH REDUCED.BUT THAT INTIMACY OF MUTUAL EMBARRASSMENT IN WHICH EACH FEELS THAT THEOTHER IS FEELING SOMETHING HAVING ONCE EXISTED ITS EFFECT IS NOT TOBE DONE AWAY WITH. TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER AND OTHER WELLBRED TOPICS ISAPT TO SEEM A HOLLOW DEVICE AND BEHAVIOR CAN HARDLY BECOME EASY UNLESSIT FRANKLY RECOGNIZES A MUTUAL FASCINATIONWHICH OF COURSE NEED NOTMEAN ANYTHING DEEP OR SERIOUS. THIS WAS THE WAY IN WHICH ROSAMOND ANDLYDGATE SLID GRACEFULLY INTO EASE AND MADE THEIR INTERCOURSE LIVELYAGAIN. VISITORS CAME AND WENT AS USUAL THERE WAS ONCE MORE MUSIC INTHE DRAWINGROOM AND ALL THE EXTRA HOSPITALITY OF MR. VINCYSMAYORALTY RETURNED. LYDGATE WHENEVER HE COULD TOOK HIS SEAT BYROSAMONDS SIDE AND LINGERED TO HEAR HER MUSIC CALLING HIMSELF HERCAPTIVEMEANING ALL THE WHILE NOT TO BE HER CAPTIVE. THEPREPOSTEROUSNESS OF THE NOTION THAT HE COULD AT ONCE SET UP ASATISFACTORY ESTABLISHMENT AS A MARRIED MAN WAS A SUFFICIENT GUARANTEEAGAINST DANGER. THIS PLAY AT BEING A LITTLE IN LOVE WAS AGREEABLE ANDDID NOT INTERFERE WITH GRAVER PURSUITS. FLIRTATION AFTER ALL WAS NOTNECESSARILY A SINGEING PROCESS. ROSAMOND FOR HER PART HAD NEVERENJOYED THE DAYS SO MUCH IN HER LIFE BEFORE SHE WAS SURE OF BEINGADMIRED BY SOME ONE WORTH CAPTIVATING AND SHE DID NOT DISTINGUISHFLIRTATION FROM LOVE EITHER IN HERSELF OR IN ANOTHER. SHE SEEMED TO BESAILING WITH A FAIR WIND JUST WHITHER SHE WOULD GO AND HER THOUGHTSWERE MUCH OCCUPIED WITH A HANDSOME HOUSE IN LOWICK GATE WHICH SHE HOPEDWOULD BYANDBY BE VACANT. SHE WAS QUITE DETERMINED WHEN SHE WASMARRIED TO RID HERSELF ADROITLY OF ALL THE VISITORS WHO WERE NOTAGREEABLE TO HER AT HER FATHERS AND SHE IMAGINED THE DRAWINGROOM INHER FAVORITE HOUSE WITH VARIOUS STYLES OF FURNITURE.CERTAINLY HER THOUGHTS WERE MUCH OCCUPIED WITH LYDGATE HIMSELF HESEEMED TO HER ALMOST PERFECT IF HE HAD KNOWN HIS NOTES SO THAT HISENCHANTMENT UNDER HER MUSIC HAD BEEN LESS LIKE AN EMOTIONAL ELEPHANTSAND IF HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DISCRIMINATE BETTER THE REFINEMENTS OF HERTASTE IN DRESS SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE MENTIONED A DEFICIENCY IN HIM.HOW DIFFERENT HE WAS FROM YOUNG PLYMDALE OR MR. CAIUS LARCHER THOSEYOUNG MEN HAD NOT A NOTION OF FRENCH AND COULD SPEAK ON NO SUBJECTWITH STRIKING KNOWLEDGE EXCEPT PERHAPS THE DYEING AND CARRYING TRADESWHICH OF COURSE THEY WERE ASHAMED TO MENTION THEY WERE MIDDLEMARCHGENTRY ELATED WITH THEIR SILVERHEADED WHIPS AND SATIN STOCKS BUTEMBARRASSED IN THEIR MANNERS AND TIMIDLY JOCOSE EVEN FRED WAS ABOVETHEM HAVING AT LEAST THE ACCENT AND MANNER OF A UNIVERSITY MAN.WHEREAS LYDGATE WAS ALWAYS LISTENED TO BORE HIMSELF WITH THE CARELESSPOLITENESS OF CONSCIOUS SUPERIORITY AND SEEMED TO HAVE THE RIGHTCLOTHES ON BY A CERTAIN NATURAL AFFINITY WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO THINKABOUT THEM. ROSAMOND WAS PROUD WHEN HE ENTERED THE ROOM AND WHEN HEAPPROACHED HER WITH A DISTINGUISHING SMILE SHE HAD A DELICIOUS SENSETHAT SHE WAS THE OBJECT OF ENVIABLE HOMAGE. IF LYDGATE HAD BEEN AWAREOF ALL THE PRIDE HE EXCITED IN THAT DELICATE BOSOM HE MIGHT HAVE BEENJUST AS WELL PLEASED AS ANY OTHER MAN EVEN THE MOST DENSELY IGNORANTOF HUMORAL PATHOLOGY OR FIBROUS TISSUE HE HELD IT ONE OF THE PRETTIESTATTITUDES OF THE FEMININE MIND TO ADORE A MANS PREEMINENCE WITHOUTTOO PRECISE A KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IT CONSISTED IN. BUT ROSAMOND WAS NOTONE OF THOSE HELPLESS GIRLS WHO BETRAY THEMSELVES UNAWARES AND WHOSEBEHAVIOR IS AWKWARDLY DRIVEN BY THEIR IMPULSES INSTEAD OF BEINGSTEERED BY WARY GRACE AND PROPRIETY. DO YOU IMAGINE THAT HER RAPIDFORECAST AND RUMINATION CONCERNING HOUSEFURNITURE AND SOCIETY WEREEVER DISCERNIBLE IN HER CONVERSATION EVEN WITH HER MAMMA ON THECONTRARY SHE WOULD HAVE EXPRESSED THE PRETTIEST SURPRISE ANDDISAPPROBATION IF SHE HAD HEARD THAT ANOTHER YOUNG LADY HAD BEENDETECTED IN THAT IMMODEST PREMATURENESSINDEED WOULD PROBABLY HAVEDISBELIEVED IN ITS POSSIBILITY. FOR ROSAMOND NEVER SHOWED ANYUNBECOMING KNOWLEDGE AND WAS ALWAYS THAT COMBINATION OF CORRECTSENTIMENTS MUSIC DANCING DRAWING ELEGANT NOTEWRITING PRIVATEALBUM FOR EXTRACTED VERSE AND PERFECT BLOND LOVELINESS WHICH MADE THEIRRESISTIBLE WOMAN FOR THE DOOMED MAN OF THAT DATE. THINK NO UNFAIREVIL OF HER PRAY SHE HAD NO WICKED PLOTS NOTHING SORDID ORMERCENARY IN FACT SHE NEVER THOUGHT OF MONEY EXCEPT AS SOMETHINGNECESSARY WHICH OTHER PEOPLE WOULD ALWAYS PROVIDE. SHE WAS NOT IN THEHABIT OF DEVISING FALSEHOODS AND IF HER STATEMENTS WERE NO DIRECT CLEWTO FACT WHY THEY WERE NOT INTENDED IN THAT LIGHTTHEY WERE AMONG HERELEGANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS INTENDED TO PLEASE. NATURE HAD INSPIRED MANYARTS IN FINISHING MRS. LEMONS FAVORITE PUPIL WHO BY GENERAL CONSENTFREDS EXCEPTED WAS A RARE COMPOUND OF BEAUTY CLEVERNESS ANDAMIABILITY.LYDGATE FOUND IT MORE AND MORE AGREEABLE TO BE WITH HER AND THERE WASNO CONSTRAINT NOW THERE WAS A DELIGHTFUL INTERCHANGE OF INFLUENCE INTHEIR EYES AND WHAT THEY SAID HAD THAT SUPERFLUITY OF MEANING FORTHEM WHICH IS OBSERVABLE WITH SOME SENSE OF FLATNESS BY A THIRDPERSON STILL THEY HAD NO INTERVIEWS OR ASIDES FROM WHICH A THIRDPERSON NEED HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED. IN FACT THEY FLIRTED AND LYDGATE WASSECURE IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY DID NOTHING ELSE. IF A MAN COULD NOTLOVE AND BE WISE SURELY HE COULD FLIRT AND BE WISE AT THE SAME TIMEREALLY THE MEN IN MIDDLEMARCH EXCEPT MR. FAREBROTHER WERE GREATBORES AND LYDGATE DID NOT CARE ABOUT COMMERCIAL POLITICS OR CARDSWHAT WAS HE TO DO FOR RELAXATION HE WAS OFTEN INVITED TO THEBULSTRODES BUT THE GIRLS THERE WERE HARDLY OUT OF THE SCHOOLROOM ANDMRS. BULSTRODES NAIVE WAY OF CONCILIATING PIETY AND WORLDLINESS THENOTHINGNESS OF THIS LIFE AND THE DESIRABILITY OF CUT GLASS THECONSCIOUSNESS AT ONCE OF FILTHY RAGS AND THE BEST DAMASK WAS NOT ASUFFICIENT RELIEF FROM THE WEIGHT OF HER HUSBANDS INVARIABLESERIOUSNESS. THE VINCYS HOUSE WITH ALL ITS FAULTS WAS THE PLEASANTERBY CONTRAST BESIDES IT NOURISHED ROSAMONDSWEET TO LOOK AT AS AHALFOPENED BLUSHROSE AND ADORNED WITH ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR THEREFINED AMUSEMENT OF MAN.BUT HE MADE SOME ENEMIES OTHER THAN MEDICAL BY HIS SUCCESS WITH MISSVINCY. ONE EVENING HE CAME INTO THE DRAWINGROOM RATHER LATE WHENSEVERAL OTHER VISITORS WERE THERE. THE CARDTABLE HAD DRAWN OFF THEELDERS AND MR. NED PLYMDALE ONE OF THE GOOD MATCHES IN MIDDLEMARCHTHOUGH NOT ONE OF ITS LEADING MINDS WAS IN TTETTE WITHROSAMOND. HE HAD BROUGHT THE LAST KEEPSAKE THE GORGEOUS WATEREDSILKPUBLICATION WHICH MARKED MODERN PROGRESS AT THAT TIME AND HECONSIDERED HIMSELF VERY FORTUNATE THAT HE COULD BE THE FIRST TO LOOKOVER IT WITH HER DWELLING ON THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WITH SHINYCOPPERPLATE CHEEKS AND COPPERPLATE SMILES AND POINTING TO COMICVERSES AS CAPITAL AND SENTIMENTAL STORIES AS INTERESTING. ROSAMOND WASGRACIOUS AND MR. NED WAS SATISFIED THAT HE HAD THE VERY BEST THING INART AND LITERATURE AS A MEDIUM FOR PAYING ADDRESSESTHE VERY THING TOPLEASE A NICE GIRL. HE HAD ALSO REASONS DEEP RATHER THAN OSTENSIBLEFOR BEING SATISFIED WITH HIS OWN APPEARANCE. TO SUPERFICIAL OBSERVERSHIS CHIN HAD TOO VANISHING AN ASPECT LOOKING AS IF IT WERE BEINGGRADUALLY REABSORBED. AND IT DID INDEED CAUSE HIM SOME DIFFICULTY ABOUTTHE FIT OF HIS SATIN STOCKS FOR WHICH CHINS WERE AT THAT TIME USEFUL.I THINK THE HONORABLE MRS. S. IS SOMETHING LIKE YOU SAID MR. NED. HEKEPT THE BOOK OPEN AT THE BEWITCHING PORTRAIT AND LOOKED AT IT RATHERLANGUISHINGLY.HER BACK IS VERY LARGE SHE SEEMS TO HAVE SAT FOR THAT SAIDROSAMOND NOT MEANING ANY SATIRE BUT THINKING HOW RED YOUNG PLYMDALESHANDS WERE AND WONDERING WHY LYDGATE DID NOT COME. SHE WENT ON WITHHER TATTING ALL THE WHILE.I DID NOT SAY SHE WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU ARE SAID MR. NEDVENTURING TO LOOK FROM THE PORTRAIT TO ITS RIVAL.I SUSPECT YOU OF BEING AN ADROIT FLATTERER SAID ROSAMOND FEELINGSURE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO REJECT THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN A SECOND TIME.BUT NOW LYDGATE CAME IN THE BOOK WAS CLOSED BEFORE HE REACHEDROSAMONDS CORNER AND AS HE TOOK HIS SEAT WITH EASY CONFIDENCE ON THEOTHER SIDE OF HER YOUNG PLYMDALES JAW FELL LIKE A BAROMETER TOWARDSTHE CHEERLESS SIDE OF CHANGE. ROSAMOND ENJOYED NOT ONLY LYDGATESPRESENCE BUT ITS EFFECT SHE LIKED TO EXCITE JEALOUSY.WHAT A LATE COMER YOU ARE SHE SAID AS THEY SHOOK HANDS. MAMMA HADGIVEN YOU UP A LITTLE WHILE AGO. HOW DO YOU FIND FREDAS USUAL GOING ON WELL BUT SLOWLY. I WANT HIM TO GO AWAYTO STONECOURT FOR EXAMPLE. BUT YOUR MAMMA SEEMS TO HAVE SOME OBJECTION.POOR FELLOW SAID ROSAMOND PRETTILY. YOU WILL SEE FRED SO CHANGEDSHE ADDED TURNING TO THE OTHER SUITOR WE HAVE LOOKED TO MR. LYDGATEAS OUR GUARDIAN ANGEL DURING THIS ILLNESS.MR. NED SMILED NERVOUSLY WHILE LYDGATE DRAWING THE KEEPSAKE TOWARDSHIM AND OPENING IT GAVE A SHORT SCORNFUL LAUGH AND TOSSED UP HIS CHINAS IF IN WONDERMENT AT HUMAN FOLLY.WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT SO PROFANELY SAID ROSAMOND WITH BLANDNEUTRALITY.I WONDER WHICH WOULD TURN OUT TO BE THE SILLIESTTHE ENGRAVINGS OR THEWRITING HERE SAID LYDGATE IN HIS MOST CONVINCED TONE WHILE HETURNED OVER THE PAGES QUICKLY SEEMING TO SEE ALL THROUGH THE BOOK INNO TIME AND SHOWING HIS LARGE WHITE HANDS TO MUCH ADVANTAGE ASROSAMOND THOUGHT. DO LOOK AT THIS BRIDEGROOM COMING OUT OF CHURCH DIDYOU EVER SEE SUCH A SUGARED INVENTIONAS THE ELIZABETHANS USED TOSAY DID ANY HABERDASHER EVER LOOK SO SMIRKING YET I WILL ANSWER FORIT THE STORY MAKES HIM ONE OF THE FIRST GENTLEMEN IN THE LAND.YOU ARE SO SEVERE I AM FRIGHTENED AT YOU SAID ROSAMOND KEEPING HERAMUSEMENT DULY MODERATE. POOR YOUNG PLYMDALE HAD LINGERED WITHADMIRATION OVER THIS VERY ENGRAVING AND HIS SPIRIT WAS STIRRED.THERE ARE A GREAT MANY CELEBRATED PEOPLE WRITING IN THE KEEPSAKE ATALL EVENTS HE SAID IN A TONE AT ONCE PIQUED AND TIMID. THIS IS THEFIRST TIME I HAVE HEARD IT CALLED SILLY.I THINK I SHALL TURN ROUND ON YOU AND ACCUSE YOU OF BEING A GOTHSAID ROSAMOND LOOKING AT LYDGATE WITH A SMILE. I SUSPECT YOU KNOWNOTHING ABOUT LADY BLESSINGTON AND L. E. L. ROSAMOND HERSELF WAS NOTWITHOUT RELISH FOR THESE WRITERS BUT SHE DID NOT READILY COMMITHERSELF BY ADMIRATION AND WAS ALIVE TO THE SLIGHTEST HINT THATANYTHING WAS NOT ACCORDING TO LYDGATE IN THE VERY HIGHEST TASTE.BUT SIR WALTER SCOTTI SUPPOSE MR. LYDGATE KNOWS HIM SAID YOUNGPLYMDALE A LITTLE CHEERED BY THIS ADVANTAGE.OH I READ NO LITERATURE NOW SAID LYDGATE SHUTTING THE BOOK ANDPUSHING IT AWAY. I READ SO MUCH WHEN I WAS A LAD THAT I SUPPOSE ITWILL LAST ME ALL MY LIFE. I USED TO KNOW SCOTTS POEMS BY HEART.I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHEN YOU LEFT OFF SAID ROSAMOND BECAUSE THENI MIGHT BE SURE THAT I KNEW SOMETHING WHICH YOU DID NOT KNOW.MR. LYDGATE WOULD SAY THAT WAS NOT WORTH KNOWING SAID MR. NEDPURPOSELY CAUSTIC.ON THE CONTRARY SAID LYDGATE SHOWING NO SMART BUT SMILING WITHEXASPERATING CONFIDENCE AT ROSAMOND. IT WOULD BE WORTH KNOWING BY THEFACT THAT MISS VINCY COULD TELL IT ME.YOUNG PLYMDALE SOON WENT TO LOOK AT THE WHISTPLAYING THINKING THATLYDGATE WAS ONE OF THE MOST CONCEITED UNPLEASANT FELLOWS IT HAD EVERBEEN HIS ILLFORTUNE TO MEET.HOW RASH YOU ARE SAID ROSAMOND INWARDLY DELIGHTED. DO YOU SEE THATYOU HAVE GIVEN OFFENCEWHAT IS IT MR. PLYMDALES BOOK I AM SORRY. I DIDNT THINK ABOUT IT.I SHALL BEGIN TO ADMIT WHAT YOU SAID OF YOURSELF WHEN YOU FIRST CAMEHERETHAT YOU ARE A BEAR AND WANT TEACHING BY THE BIRDS.WELL THERE IS A BIRD WHO CAN TEACH ME WHAT SHE WILL. DONT I LISTENTO HER WILLINGLYTO ROSAMOND IT SEEMED AS IF SHE AND LYDGATE WERE AS GOOD AS ENGAGED.THAT THEY WERE SOME TIME TO BE ENGAGED HAD LONG BEEN AN IDEA IN HERMIND AND IDEAS WE KNOW TEND TO A MORE SOLID KIND OF EXISTENCE THENECESSARY MATERIALS BEING AT HAND. IT IS TRUE LYDGATE HAD THECOUNTERIDEA OF REMAINING UNENGAGED BUT THIS WAS A MERE NEGATIVE ASHADOW CAST BY OTHER RESOLVES WHICH THEMSELVES WERE CAPABLE OFSHRINKING. CIRCUMSTANCE WAS ALMOST SURE TO BE ON THE SIDE OF ROSAMONDSIDEA WHICH HAD A SHAPING ACTIVITY AND LOOKED THROUGH WATCHFUL BLUEEYES WHEREAS LYDGATES LAY BLIND AND UNCONCERNED AS A JELLYFISH WHICHGETS MELTED WITHOUT KNOWING IT.THAT EVENING WHEN HE WENT HOME HE LOOKED AT HIS PHIALS TO SEE HOW APROCESS OF MACERATION WAS GOING ON WITH UNDISTURBED INTEREST AND HEWROTE OUT HIS DAILY NOTES WITH AS MUCH PRECISION AS USUAL. THE REVERIESFROM WHICH IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO DETACH HIMSELF WERE IDEALCONSTRUCTIONS OF SOMETHING ELSE THAN ROSAMONDS VIRTUES AND THEPRIMITIVE TISSUE WAS STILL HIS FAIR UNKNOWN. MOREOVER HE WAS BEGINNINGTO FEEL SOME ZEST FOR THE GROWING THOUGH HALFSUPPRESSED FEUD BETWEENHIM AND THE OTHER MEDICAL MEN WHICH WAS LIKELY TO BECOME MOREMANIFEST NOW THAT BULSTRODES METHOD OF MANAGING THE NEW HOSPITAL WASABOUT TO BE DECLARED AND THERE WERE VARIOUS INSPIRITING SIGNS THAT HISNONACCEPTANCE BY SOME OF PEACOCKS PATIENTS MIGHT BE COUNTERBALANCEDBY THE IMPRESSION HE HAD PRODUCED IN OTHER QUARTERS. ONLY A FEW DAYSLATER WHEN HE HAD HAPPENED TO OVERTAKE ROSAMOND ON THE LOWICK ROAD ANDHAD GOT DOWN FROM HIS HORSE TO WALK BY HER SIDE UNTIL HE HAD QUITEPROTECTED HER FROM A PASSING DROVE HE HAD BEEN STOPPED BY A SERVANT ONHORSEBACK WITH A MESSAGE CALLING HIM IN TO A HOUSE OF SOME IMPORTANCEWHERE PEACOCK HAD NEVER ATTENDED AND IT WAS THE SECOND INSTANCE OFTHIS KIND. THE SERVANT WAS SIR JAMES CHETTAMS AND THE HOUSE WASLOWICK MANOR.CHAPTER XXVIII.ST GENT. ALL TIMES ARE GOOD TO SEEK YOUR WEDDED HOME    BRINGING A MUTUAL DELIGHT.D GENT. WHY TRUE.    THE CALENDAR HATH NOT AN EVIL DAY    FOR SOULS MADE ONE BY LOVE AND EVEN DEATH    WERE SWEETNESS IF IT CAME LIKE ROLLING WAVES    WHILE THEY TWO CLASPED EACH OTHER AND FORESAW    NO LIFE APART.MR. AND MRS. CASAUBON RETURNING FROM THEIR WEDDING JOURNEY ARRIVED ATLOWICK MANOR IN THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY. A LIGHT SNOW WAS FALLING AS THEYDESCENDED AT THE DOOR AND IN THE MORNING WHEN DOROTHEA PASSED FROMHER DRESSINGROOM INTO THE BLUEGREEN BOUDOIR THAT WE KNOW OF SHE SAWTHE LONG AVENUE OF LIMES LIFTING THEIR TRUNKS FROM A WHITE EARTH ANDSPREADING WHITE BRANCHES AGAINST THE DUN AND MOTIONLESS SKY. THEDISTANT FLAT SHRANK IN UNIFORM WHITENESS AND LOWHANGING UNIFORMITY OFCLOUD. THE VERY FURNITURE IN THE ROOM SEEMED TO HAVE SHRUNK SINCE SHESAW IT BEFORE THE STAG IN THE TAPESTRY LOOKED MORE LIKE A GHOST IN HISGHOSTLY BLUEGREEN WORLD THE VOLUMES OF POLITE LITERATURE IN THEBOOKCASE LOOKED MORE LIKE IMMOVABLE IMITATIONS OF BOOKS. THE BRIGHTFIRE OF DRY OAKBOUGHS BURNING ON THE LOGS SEEMED AN INCONGRUOUSRENEWAL OF LIFE AND GLOWLIKE THE FIGURE OF DOROTHEA HERSELF AS SHEENTERED CARRYING THE REDLEATHER CASES CONTAINING THE CAMEOS FOR CELIA.SHE WAS GLOWING FROM HER MORNING TOILET AS ONLY HEALTHFUL YOUTH CANGLOW THERE WAS GEMLIKE BRIGHTNESS ON HER COILED HAIR AND IN HER HAZELEYES THERE WAS WARM RED LIFE IN HER LIPS HER THROAT HAD A BREATHINGWHITENESS ABOVE THE DIFFERING WHITE OF THE FUR WHICH ITSELF SEEMED TOWIND ABOUT HER NECK AND CLING DOWN HER BLUEGRAY PELISSE WITH ATENDERNESS GATHERED FROM HER OWN A SENTIENT COMMINGLED INNOCENCE WHICHKEPT ITS LOVELINESS AGAINST THE CRYSTALLINE PURITY OF THE OUTDOOR SNOW.AS SHE LAID THE CAMEOCASES ON THE TABLE IN THE BOWWINDOW SHEUNCONSCIOUSLY KEPT HER HANDS ON THEM IMMEDIATELY ABSORBED IN LOOKINGOUT ON THE STILL WHITE ENCLOSURE WHICH MADE HER VISIBLE WORLD.MR. CASAUBON WHO HAD RISEN EARLY COMPLAINING OF PALPITATION WAS INTHE LIBRARY GIVING AUDIENCE TO HIS CURATE MR. TUCKER. BYANDBY CELIAWOULD COME IN HER QUALITY OF BRIDESMAID AS WELL AS SISTER AND THROUGHTHE NEXT WEEKS THERE WOULD BE WEDDING VISITS RECEIVED AND GIVEN ALL INCONTINUANCE OF THAT TRANSITIONAL LIFE UNDERSTOOD TO CORRESPOND WITH THEEXCITEMENT OF BRIDAL FELICITY AND KEEPING UP THE SENSE OF BUSYINEFFECTIVENESS AS OF A DREAM WHICH THE DREAMER BEGINS TO SUSPECT. THEDUTIES OF HER MARRIED LIFE CONTEMPLATED AS SO GREAT BEFOREHAND SEEMEDTO BE SHRINKING WITH THE FURNITURE AND THE WHITE VAPORWALLEDLANDSCAPE. THE CLEAR HEIGHTS WHERE SHE EXPECTED TO WALK IN FULLCOMMUNION HAD BECOME DIFFICULT TO SEE EVEN IN HER IMAGINATION THEDELICIOUS REPOSE OF THE SOUL ON A COMPLETE SUPERIOR HAD BEEN SHAKENINTO UNEASY EFFORT AND ALARMED WITH DIM PRESENTIMENT. WHEN WOULD THEDAYS BEGIN OF THAT ACTIVE WIFELY DEVOTION WHICH WAS TO STRENGTHEN HERHUSBANDS LIFE AND EXALT HER OWN NEVER PERHAPS AS SHE HADPRECONCEIVED THEM BUT SOMEHOWSTILL SOMEHOW. IN THIS SOLEMNLY PLEDGEDUNION OF HER LIFE DUTY WOULD PRESENT ITSELF IN SOME NEW FORM OFINSPIRATION AND GIVE A NEW MEANING TO WIFELY LOVE.MEANWHILE THERE WAS THE SNOW AND THE LOW ARCH OF DUN VAPORTHERE WASTHE STIFLING OPPRESSION OF THAT GENTLEWOMANS WORLD WHERE EVERYTHINGWAS DONE FOR HER AND NONE ASKED FOR HER AIDWHERE THE SENSE OFCONNECTION WITH A MANIFOLD PREGNANT EXISTENCE HAD TO BE KEPT UPPAINFULLY AS AN INWARD VISION INSTEAD OF COMING FROM WITHOUT IN CLAIMSTHAT WOULD HAVE SHAPED HER ENERGIES. WHAT SHALL I DO WHATEVER YOUPLEASE MY DEAR THAT HAD BEEN HER BRIEF HISTORY SINCE SHE HAD LEFTOFF LEARNING MORNING LESSONS AND PRACTISING SILLY RHYTHMS ON THE HATEDPIANO. MARRIAGE WHICH WAS TO BRING GUIDANCE INTO WORTHY AND IMPERATIVEOCCUPATION HAD NOT YET FREED HER FROM THE GENTLEWOMANS OPPRESSIVELIBERTY IT HAD NOT EVEN FILLED HER LEISURE WITH THE RUMINANT JOY OFUNCHECKED TENDERNESS. HER BLOOMING FULLPULSED YOUTH STOOD THERE IN AMORAL IMPRISONMENT WHICH MADE ITSELF ONE WITH THE CHILL COLORLESSNARROWED LANDSCAPE WITH THE SHRUNKEN FURNITURE THE NEVERREAD BOOKSAND THE GHOSTLY STAG IN A PALE FANTASTIC WORLD THAT SEEMED TO BEVANISHING FROM THE DAYLIGHT.IN THE FIRST MINUTES WHEN DOROTHEA LOOKED OUT SHE FELT NOTHING BUT THEDREARY OPPRESSION THEN CAME A KEEN REMEMBRANCE AND TURNING AWAY FROMTHE WINDOW SHE WALKED ROUND THE ROOM. THE IDEAS AND HOPES WHICH WERELIVING IN HER MIND WHEN SHE FIRST SAW THIS ROOM NEARLY THREE MONTHSBEFORE WERE PRESENT NOW ONLY AS MEMORIES SHE JUDGED THEM AS WE JUDGETRANSIENT AND DEPARTED THINGS. ALL EXISTENCE SEEMED TO BEAT WITH ALOWER PULSE THAN HER OWN AND HER RELIGIOUS FAITH WAS A SOLITARY CRYTHE STRUGGLE OUT OF A NIGHTMARE IN WHICH EVERY OBJECT WAS WITHERING ANDSHRINKING AWAY FROM HER. EACH REMEMBERED THING IN THE ROOM WASDISENCHANTED WAS DEADENED AS AN UNLIT TRANSPARENCY TILL HER WANDERINGGAZE CAME TO THE GROUP OF MINIATURES AND THERE AT LAST SHE SAWSOMETHING WHICH HAD GATHERED NEW BREATH AND MEANING IT WAS THEMINIATURE OF MR. CASAUBONS AUNT JULIA WHO HAD MADE THE UNFORTUNATEMARRIAGEOF WILL LADISLAWS GRANDMOTHER. DOROTHEA COULD FANCY THAT ITWAS ALIVE NOWTHE DELICATE WOMANS FACE WHICH YET HAD A HEADSTRONGLOOK A PECULIARITY DIFFICULT TO INTERPRET. WAS IT ONLY HER FRIENDS WHOTHOUGHT HER MARRIAGE UNFORTUNATE OR DID SHE HERSELF FIND IT OUT TO BEA MISTAKE AND TASTE THE SALT BITTERNESS OF HER TEARS IN THE MERCIFULSILENCE OF THE NIGHT WHAT BREADTHS OF EXPERIENCE DOROTHEA SEEMED TOHAVE PASSED OVER SINCE SHE FIRST LOOKED AT THIS MINIATURE SHE FELT ANEW COMPANIONSHIP WITH IT AS IF IT HAD AN EAR FOR HER AND COULD SEEHOW SHE WAS LOOKING AT IT. HERE WAS A WOMAN WHO HAD KNOWN SOMEDIFFICULTY ABOUT MARRIAGE. NAY THE COLORS DEEPENED THE LIPS AND CHINSEEMED TO GET LARGER THE HAIR AND EYES SEEMED TO BE SENDING OUT LIGHTTHE FACE WAS MASCULINE AND BEAMED ON HER WITH THAT FULL GAZE WHICHTELLS HER ON WHOM IT FALLS THAT SHE IS TOO INTERESTING FOR THESLIGHTEST MOVEMENT OF HER EYELID TO PASS UNNOTICED AND UNINTERPRETED.THE VIVID PRESENTATION CAME LIKE A PLEASANT GLOW TO DOROTHEA SHE FELTHERSELF SMILING AND TURNING FROM THE MINIATURE SAT DOWN AND LOOKED UPAS IF SHE WERE AGAIN TALKING TO A FIGURE IN FRONT OF HER. BUT THE SMILEDISAPPEARED AS SHE WENT ON MEDITATING AND AT LAST SHE SAID ALOUDOH IT WAS CRUEL TO SPEAK SO HOW SADHOW DREADFULSHE ROSE QUICKLY AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM HURRYING ALONG THE CORRIDORWITH THE IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE TO GO AND SEE HER HUSBAND AND INQUIRE IFSHE COULD DO ANYTHING FOR HIM. PERHAPS MR. TUCKER WAS GONE AND MR.CASAUBON WAS ALONE IN THE LIBRARY. SHE FELT AS IF ALL HER MORNINGSGLOOM WOULD VANISH IF SHE COULD SEE HER HUSBAND GLAD BECAUSE OF HERPRESENCE.BUT WHEN SHE REACHED THE HEAD OF THE DARK OAK THERE WAS CELIA COMINGUP AND BELOW THERE WAS MR. BROOKE EXCHANGING WELCOMES ANDCONGRATULATIONS WITH MR. CASAUBON.DODO SAID CELIA IN HER QUIET STACCATO THEN KISSED HER SISTERWHOSE ARMS ENCIRCLED HER AND SAID NO MORE. I THINK THEY BOTH CRIED ALITTLE IN A FURTIVE MANNER WHILE DOROTHEA RAN DOWNSTAIRS TO GREET HERUNCLE.I NEED NOT ASK HOW YOU ARE MY DEAR SAID MR. BROOKE AFTER KISSINGHER FOREHEAD. ROME HAS AGREED WITH YOU I SEEHAPPINESS FRESCOS THEANTIQUETHAT SORT OF THING. WELL ITS VERY PLEASANT TO HAVE YOU BACKAGAIN AND YOU UNDERSTAND ALL ABOUT ART NOW EH BUT CASAUBON IS ALITTLE PALE I TELL HIMA LITTLE PALE YOU KNOW. STUDYING HARD IN HISHOLIDAYS IS CARRYING IT RATHER TOO FAR. I OVERDID IT AT ONE TIMEMR.BROOKE STILL HELD DOROTHEAS HAND BUT HAD TURNED HIS FACE TO MR.CASAUBONABOUT TOPOGRAPHY RUINS TEMPLESI THOUGHT I HAD A CLEW BUTI SAW IT WOULD CARRY ME TOO FAR AND NOTHING MIGHT COME OF IT. YOU MAYGO ANY LENGTH IN THAT SORT OF THING AND NOTHING MAY COME OF IT YOUKNOW.DOROTHEAS EYES ALSO WERE TURNED UP TO HER HUSBANDS FACE WITH SOMEANXIETY AT THE IDEA THAT THOSE WHO SAW HIM AFRESH AFTER ABSENCE MIGHTBE AWARE OF SIGNS WHICH SHE HAD NOT NOTICED.NOTHING TO ALARM YOU MY DEAR SAID MR. BROOKE OBSERVING HEREXPRESSION. A LITTLE ENGLISH BEEF AND MUTTON WILL SOON MAKE ADIFFERENCE. IT WAS ALL VERY WELL TO LOOK PALE SITTING FOR THE PORTRAITOF AQUINAS YOU KNOWWE GOT YOUR LETTER JUST IN TIME. BUT AQUINASNOWHE WAS A LITTLE TOO SUBTLE WASNT HE DOES ANYBODY READ AQUINASHE IS NOT INDEED AN AUTHOR ADAPTED TO SUPERFICIAL MINDS SAID MR.CASAUBON MEETING THESE TIMELY QUESTIONS WITH DIGNIFIED PATIENCE.YOU WOULD LIKE COFFEE IN YOUR OWN ROOM UNCLE SAID DOROTHEA COMINGTO THE RESCUE.YES AND YOU MUST GO TO CELIA SHE HAS GREAT NEWS TO TELL YOU YOUKNOW. I LEAVE IT ALL TO HER.THE BLUEGREEN BOUDOIR LOOKED MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN CELIA WAS SEATEDTHERE IN A PELISSE EXACTLY LIKE HER SISTERS SURVEYING THE CAMEOS WITHA PLACID SATISFACTION WHILE THE CONVERSATION PASSED ON TO OTHERTOPICS.DO YOU THINK IT NICE TO GO TO ROME ON A WEDDING JOURNEY SAID CELIAWITH HER READY DELICATE BLUSH WHICH DOROTHEA WAS USED TO ON THESMALLEST OCCASIONS.IT WOULD NOT SUIT ALLNOT YOU DEAR FOR EXAMPLE SAID DOROTHEAQUIETLY. NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF A WEDDING JOURNEYTO ROME.MRS. CADWALLADER SAYS IT IS NONSENSE PEOPLE GOING A LONG JOURNEY WHENTHEY ARE MARRIED. SHE SAYS THEY GET TIRED TO DEATH OF EACH OTHER ANDCANT QUARREL COMFORTABLY AS THEY WOULD AT HOME. AND LADY CHETTAM SAYSSHE WENT TO BATH. CELIAS COLOR CHANGED AGAIN AND AGAINSEEMEDTO COME AND GO WITH TIDINGS FROM THE HEARTAS IT A RUNNING MESSENGER HAD BEEN.IT MUST MEAN MORE THAN CELIAS BLUSHING USUALLY DID.CELIA HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED SAID DOROTHEA IN A TONE FULL OFSISTERLY FEELING. HAVE YOU REALLY ANY GREAT NEWS TO TELL MEIT WAS BECAUSE YOU WENT AWAY DODO. THEN THERE WAS NOBODY BUT ME FORSIR JAMES TO TALK TO SAID CELIA WITH A CERTAIN ROGUISHNESS IN HEREYES.I UNDERSTAND. IT IS AS I USED TO HOPE AND BELIEVE SAID DOROTHEATAKING HER SISTERS FACE BETWEEN HER HANDS AND LOOKING AT HER HALFANXIOUSLY. CELIAS MARRIAGE SEEMED MORE SERIOUS THAN IT USED TO DO.IT WAS ONLY THREE DAYS AGO SAID CELIA. AND LADY CHETTAM IS VERYKIND.AND YOU ARE VERY HAPPYYES. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE MARRIED YET. BECAUSE EVERY THING IS TO BEGOT READY. AND I DONT WANT TO BE MARRIED SO VERY SOON BECAUSE I THINKIT IS NICE TO BE ENGAGED. AND WE SHALL BE MARRIED ALL OUR LIVES AFTER.I DO BELIEVE YOU COULD NOT MARRY BETTER KITTY. SIR JAMES IS A GOODHONORABLE MAN SAID DOROTHEA WARMLY.HE HAS GONE ON WITH THE COTTAGES DODO. HE WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THEMWHEN HE COMES. SHALL YOU BE GLAD TO SEE HIMOF COURSE I SHALL. HOW CAN YOU ASK MEONLY I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULD BE GETTING SO LEARNED SAID CELIAREGARDING MR. CASAUBONS LEARNING AS A KIND OF DAMP WHICH MIGHT IN DUETIME SATURATE A NEIGHBORING BODY.CHAPTER XXIX.I FOUND THAT NO GENIUS IN ANOTHER COULD PLEASE ME. MY UNFORTUNATEPARADOXES HAD ENTIRELY DRIED UP THAT SOURCE OF COMFORT.GOLDSMITH.ONE MORNING SOME WEEKS AFTER HER ARRIVAL AT LOWICK DOROTHEABUT WHYALWAYS DOROTHEA WAS HER POINT OF VIEW THE ONLY POSSIBLE ONE WITHREGARD TO THIS MARRIAGE I PROTEST AGAINST ALL OUR INTEREST ALL OUREFFORT AT UNDERSTANDING BEING GIVEN TO THE YOUNG SKINS THAT LOOKBLOOMING IN SPITE OF TROUBLE FOR THESE TOO WILL GET FADED AND WILLKNOW THE OLDER AND MORE EATING GRIEFS WHICH WE ARE HELPING TO NEGLECT.IN SPITE OF THE BLINKING EYES AND WHITE MOLES OBJECTIONABLE TO CELIAAND THE WANT OF MUSCULAR CURVE WHICH WAS MORALLY PAINFUL TO SIR JAMESMR. CASAUBON HAD AN INTENSE CONSCIOUSNESS WITHIN HIM AND WASSPIRITUALLY AHUNGERED LIKE THE REST OF US. HE HAD DONE NOTHINGEXCEPTIONAL IN MARRYINGNOTHING BUT WHAT SOCIETY SANCTIONS ANDCONSIDERS AN OCCASION FOR WREATHS AND BOUQUETS. IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIMTHAT HE MUST NOT ANY LONGER DEFER HIS INTENTION OF MATRIMONY AND HEHAD REFLECTED THAT IN TAKING A WIFE A MAN OF GOOD POSITION SHOULDEXPECT AND CAREFULLY CHOOSE A BLOOMING YOUNG LADYTHE YOUNGER THEBETTER BECAUSE MORE EDUCABLE AND SUBMISSIVEOF A RANK EQUAL TO HISOWN OF RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES VIRTUOUS DISPOSITION AND GOODUNDERSTANDING. ON SUCH A YOUNG LADY HE WOULD MAKE HANDSOME SETTLEMENTSAND HE WOULD NEGLECT NO ARRANGEMENT FOR HER HAPPINESS IN RETURN HESHOULD RECEIVE FAMILY PLEASURES AND LEAVE BEHIND HIM THAT COPY OFHIMSELF WHICH SEEMED SO URGENTLY REQUIRED OF A MANTO THE SONNETEERS OFTHE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. TIMES HAD ALTERED SINCE THEN AND NO SONNETEERHAD INSISTED ON MR. CASAUBONS LEAVING A COPY OF HIMSELF MOREOVER HEHAD NOT YET SUCCEEDED IN ISSUING COPIES OF HIS MYTHOLOGICAL KEY BUT HEHAD ALWAYS INTENDED TO ACQUIT HIMSELF BY MARRIAGE AND THE SENSE THATHE WAS FAST LEAVING THE YEARS BEHIND HIM THAT THE WORLD WAS GETTINGDIMMER AND THAT HE FELT LONELY WAS A REASON TO HIM FOR LOSING NO MORETIME IN OVERTAKING DOMESTIC DELIGHTS BEFORE THEY TOO WERE LEFT BEHINDBY THE YEARS.AND WHEN HE HAD SEEN DOROTHEA HE BELIEVED THAT HE HAD FOUND EVEN MORETHAN HE DEMANDED SHE MIGHT REALLY BE SUCH A HELPMATE TO HIM AS WOULDENABLE HIM TO DISPENSE WITH A HIRED SECRETARY AN AID WHICH MR.CASAUBON HAD NEVER YET EMPLOYED AND HAD A SUSPICIOUS DREAD OF. MR.CASAUBON WAS NERVOUSLY CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS EXPECTED TO MANIFEST APOWERFUL MIND. PROVIDENCE IN ITS KINDNESS HAD SUPPLIED HIM WITH THEWIFE HE NEEDED. A WIFE A MODEST YOUNG LADY WITH THE PURELYAPPRECIATIVE UNAMBITIOUS ABILITIES OF HER SEX IS SURE TO THINK HERHUSBANDS MIND POWERFUL. WHETHER PROVIDENCE HAD TAKEN EQUAL CARE OFMISS BROOKE IN PRESENTING HER WITH MR. CASAUBON WAS AN IDEA WHICH COULDHARDLY OCCUR TO HIM. SOCIETY NEVER MADE THE PREPOSTEROUS DEMAND THAT AMAN SHOULD THINK AS MUCH ABOUT HIS OWN QUALIFICATIONS FOR MAKING ACHARMING GIRL HAPPY AS HE THINKS OF HERS FOR MAKING HIMSELF HAPPY. ASIF A MAN COULD CHOOSE NOT ONLY HIS WIFE BUT HIS WIFES HUSBAND OR ASIF HE WERE BOUND TO PROVIDE CHARMS FOR HIS POSTERITY IN HIS OWNPERSON WHEN DOROTHEA ACCEPTED HIM WITH EFFUSION THAT WAS ONLYNATURAL AND MR. CASAUBON BELIEVED THAT HIS HAPPINESS WAS GOING TOBEGIN.HE HAD NOT HAD MUCH FORETASTE OF HAPPINESS IN HIS PREVIOUS LIFE. TOKNOW INTENSE JOY WITHOUT A STRONG BODILY FRAME ONE MUST HAVE ANENTHUSIASTIC SOUL. MR. CASAUBON HAD NEVER HAD A STRONG BODILY FRAMEAND HIS SOUL WAS SENSITIVE WITHOUT BEING ENTHUSIASTIC IT WAS TOOLANGUID TO THRILL OUT OF SELFCONSCIOUSNESS INTO PASSIONATE DELIGHT ITWENT ON FLUTTERING IN THE SWAMPY GROUND WHERE IT WAS HATCHED THINKINGOF ITS WINGS AND NEVER FLYING. HIS EXPERIENCE WAS OF THAT PITIABLE KINDWHICH SHRINKS FROM PITY AND FEARS MOST OF ALL THAT IT SHOULD BE KNOWNIT WAS THAT PROUD NARROW SENSITIVENESS WHICH HAS NOT MASS ENOUGH TOSPARE FOR TRANSFORMATION INTO SYMPATHY AND QUIVERS THREADLIKE INSMALL CURRENTS OF SELFPREOCCUPATION OR AT BEST OF AN EGOISTICSCRUPULOSITY. AND MR. CASAUBON HAD MANY SCRUPLES HE WAS CAPABLE OF ASEVERE SELFRESTRAINT HE WAS RESOLUTE IN BEING A MAN OF HONORACCORDING TO THE CODE HE WOULD BE UNIMPEACHABLE BY ANY RECOGNIZEDOPINION. IN CONDUCT THESE ENDS HAD BEEN ATTAINED BUT THE DIFFICULTY OFMAKING HIS KEY TO ALL MYTHOLOGIES UNIMPEACHABLE WEIGHED LIKE LEAD UPONHIS MIND AND THE PAMPHLETSOR PARERGA AS HE CALLED THEMBY WHICH HETESTED HIS PUBLIC AND DEPOSITED SMALL MONUMENTAL RECORDS OF HIS MARCHWERE FAR FROM HAVING BEEN SEEN IN ALL THEIR SIGNIFICANCE. HE SUSPECTEDTHE ARCHDEACON OF NOT HAVING READ THEM HE WAS IN PAINFUL DOUBT AS TOWHAT WAS REALLY THOUGHT OF THEM BY THE LEADING MINDS OF BRASENOSE ANDBITTERLY CONVINCED THAT HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCE CARP HAD BEEN THE WRITEROF THAT DEPRECIATORY RECENSION WHICH WAS KEPT LOCKED IN A SMALL DRAWEROF MR. CASAUBONS DESK AND ALSO IN A DARK CLOSET OF HIS VERBAL MEMORY.THESE WERE HEAVY IMPRESSIONS TO STRUGGLE AGAINST AND BROUGHT THATMELANCHOLY EMBITTERMENT WHICH IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF ALL EXCESSIVECLAIM EVEN HIS RELIGIOUS FAITH WAVERED WITH HIS WAVERING TRUST IN HISOWN AUTHORSHIP AND THE CONSOLATIONS OF THE CHRISTIAN HOPE INIMMORTALITY SEEMED TO LEAN ON THE IMMORTALITY OF THE STILL UNWRITTENKEY TO ALL MYTHOLOGIES. FOR MY PART I AM VERY SORRY FOR HIM. IT IS ANUNEASY LOT AT BEST TO BE WHAT WE CALL HIGHLY TAUGHT AND YET NOT TOENJOY TO BE PRESENT AT THIS GREAT SPECTACLE OF LIFE AND NEVER TO BELIBERATED FROM A SMALL HUNGRY SHIVERING SELFNEVER TO BE FULLYPOSSESSED BY THE GLORY WE BEHOLD NEVER TO HAVE OUR CONSCIOUSNESSRAPTUROUSLY TRANSFORMED INTO THE VIVIDNESS OF A THOUGHT THE ARDOR OF APASSION THE ENERGY OF AN ACTION BUT ALWAYS TO BE SCHOLARLY ANDUNINSPIRED AMBITIOUS AND TIMID SCRUPULOUS AND DIMSIGHTED. BECOMING ADEAN OR EVEN A BISHOP WOULD MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE I FEAR TO MR.CASAUBONS UNEASINESS. DOUBTLESS SOME ANCIENT GREEK HAS OBSERVED THATBEHIND THE BIG MASK AND THE SPEAKINGTRUMPET THERE MUST ALWAYS BE OURPOOR LITTLE EYES PEEPING AS USUAL AND OUR TIMOROUS LIPS MORE OR LESSUNDER ANXIOUS CONTROL.TO THIS MENTAL ESTATE MAPPED OUT A QUARTER OF A CENTURY BEFORE TOSENSIBILITIES THUS FENCED IN MR. CASAUBON HAD THOUGHT OF ANNEXINGHAPPINESS WITH A LOVELY YOUNG BRIDE BUT EVEN BEFORE MARRIAGE AS WEHAVE SEEN HE FOUND HIMSELF UNDER A NEW DEPRESSION IN THE CONSCIOUSNESSTHAT THE NEW BLISS WAS NOT BLISSFUL TO HIM. INCLINATION YEARNED BACK TOITS OLD EASIER CUSTOM. AND THE DEEPER HE WENT IN DOMESTICITY THE MOREDID THE SENSE OF ACQUITTING HIMSELF AND ACTING WITH PROPRIETYPREDOMINATE OVER ANY OTHER SATISFACTION. MARRIAGE LIKE RELIGION ANDERUDITION NAY LIKE AUTHORSHIP ITSELF WAS FATED TO BECOME AN OUTWARDREQUIREMENT AND EDWARD CASAUBON WAS BENT ON FULFILLING UNIMPEACHABLYALL REQUIREMENTS. EVEN DRAWING DOROTHEA INTO USE IN HIS STUDYACCORDING TO HIS OWN INTENTION BEFORE MARRIAGE WAS AN EFFORT WHICH HEWAS ALWAYS TEMPTED TO DEFER AND BUT FOR HER PLEADING INSISTENCE ITMIGHT NEVER HAVE BEGUN. BUT SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN MAKING IT A MATTER OFCOURSE THAT SHE SHOULD TAKE HER PLACE AT AN EARLY HOUR IN THE LIBRARYAND HAVE WORK EITHER OF READING ALOUD OR COPYING ASSIGNED HER. THE WORKHAD BEEN EASIER TO DEFINE BECAUSE MR. CASAUBON HAD ADOPTED AN IMMEDIATEINTENTION THERE WAS TO BE A NEW PARERGON A SMALL MONOGRAPH ON SOMELATELY TRACED INDICATIONS CONCERNING THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERIES WHEREBYCERTAIN ASSERTIONS OF WARBURTONS COULD BE CORRECTED. REFERENCES WEREEXTENSIVE EVEN HERE BUT NOT ALTOGETHER SHORELESS AND SENTENCES WEREACTUALLY TO BE WRITTEN IN THE SHAPE WHEREIN THEY WOULD BE SCANNED BYBRASENOSE AND A LESS FORMIDABLE POSTERITY. THESE MINOR MONUMENTALPRODUCTIONS WERE ALWAYS EXCITING TO MR. CASAUBON DIGESTION WAS MADEDIFFICULT BY THE INTERFERENCE OF CITATIONS OR BY THE RIVALRY OFDIALECTICAL PHRASES RINGING AGAINST EACH OTHER IN HIS BRAIN. AND FROMTHE FIRST THERE WAS TO BE A LATIN DEDICATION ABOUT WHICH EVERYTHING WASUNCERTAIN EXCEPT THAT IT WAS NOT TO BE ADDRESSED TO CARP IT WAS APOISONOUS REGRET TO MR. CASAUBON THAT HE HAD ONCE ADDRESSED ADEDICATION TO CARP IN WHICH HE HAD NUMBERED THAT MEMBER OF THE ANIMALKINGDOM AMONG THE VIROS NULLO VO PERITUROS A MISTAKE WHICH WOULDINFALLIBLY LAY THE DEDICATOR OPEN TO RIDICULE IN THE NEXT AGE ANDMIGHT EVEN BE CHUCKLED OVER BY PIKE AND TENCH IN THE PRESENT.THUS MR. CASAUBON WAS IN ONE OF HIS BUSIEST EPOCHS AND AS I BEGAN TOSAY A LITTLE WHILE AGO DOROTHEA JOINED HIM EARLY IN THE LIBRARY WHEREHE HAD BREAKFASTED ALONE. CELIA AT THIS TIME WAS ON A SECOND VISIT TOLOWICK PROBABLY THE LAST BEFORE HER MARRIAGE AND WAS IN THEDRAWINGROOM EXPECTING SIR JAMES.DOROTHEA HAD LEARNED TO READ THE SIGNS OF HER HUSBANDS MOOD AND SHESAW THAT THE MORNING HAD BECOME MORE FOGGY THERE DURING THE LAST HOUR.SHE WAS GOING SILENTLY TO HER DESK WHEN HE SAID IN THAT DISTANT TONEWHICH IMPLIED THAT HE WAS DISCHARGING A DISAGREEABLE DUTYDOROTHEA HERE IS A LETTER FOR YOU WHICH WAS ENCLOSED IN ONEADDRESSED TO ME.IT WAS A LETTER OF TWO PAGES AND SHE IMMEDIATELY LOOKED AT THESIGNATURE.MR. LADISLAW WHAT CAN HE HAVE TO SAY TO ME SHE EXCLAIMED IN A TONEOF PLEASED SURPRISE. BUT SHE ADDED LOOKING AT MR. CASAUBON I CANIMAGINE WHAT HE HAS WRITTEN TO YOU ABOUT.YOU CAN IF YOU PLEASE READ THE LETTER SAID MR. CASAUBON SEVERELYPOINTING TO IT WITH HIS PEN AND NOT LOOKING AT HER. BUT I MAY AS WELLSAY BEFOREHAND THAT I MUST DECLINE THE PROPOSAL IT CONTAINS TO PAY AVISIT HERE. I TRUST I MAY BE EXCUSED FOR DESIRING AN INTERVAL OFCOMPLETE FREEDOM FROM SUCH DISTRACTIONS AS HAVE BEEN HITHERTOINEVITABLE AND ESPECIALLY FROM GUESTS WHOSE DESULTORY VIVACITY MAKESTHEIR PRESENCE A FATIGUE.THERE HAD BEEN NO CLASHING OF TEMPER BETWEEN DOROTHEA AND HER HUSBANDSINCE THAT LITTLE EXPLOSION IN ROME WHICH HAD LEFT SUCH STRONG TRACESIN HER MIND THAT IT HAD BEEN EASIER EVER SINCE TO QUELL EMOTION THAN TOINCUR THE CONSEQUENCE OF VENTING IT. BUT THIS ILLTEMPERED ANTICIPATIONTHAT SHE COULD DESIRE VISITS WHICH MIGHT BE DISAGREEABLE TO HERHUSBAND THIS GRATUITOUS DEFENCE OF HIMSELF AGAINST SELFISH COMPLAINTON HER PART WAS TOO SHARP A STING TO BE MEDITATED ON UNTIL AFTER ITHAD BEEN RESENTED. DOROTHEA HAD THOUGHT THAT SHE COULD HAVE BEENPATIENT WITH JOHN MILTON BUT SHE HAD NEVER IMAGINED HIM BEHAVING INTHIS WAY AND FOR A MOMENT MR. CASAUBON SEEMED TO BE STUPIDLYUNDISCERNING AND ODIOUSLY UNJUST. PITY THAT NEWBORN BABE WHICH WASBYANDBY TO RULE MANY A STORM WITHIN HER DID NOT STRIDE THE BLASTON THIS OCCASION. WITH HER FIRST WORDS UTTERED IN A TONE THAT SHOOKHIM SHE STARTLED MR. CASAUBON INTO LOOKING AT HER AND MEETING THEFLASH OF HER EYES.WHY DO YOU ATTRIBUTE TO ME A WISH FOR ANYTHING THAT WOULD ANNOY YOUYOU SPEAK TO ME AS IF I WERE SOMETHING YOU HAD TO CONTEND AGAINST. WAITAT LEAST TILL I APPEAR TO CONSULT MY OWN PLEASURE APART FROM YOURS.DOROTHEA YOU ARE HASTY ANSWERED MR. CASAUBON NERVOUSLY.DECIDEDLY THIS WOMAN WAS TOO YOUNG TO BE ON THE FORMIDABLE LEVEL OFWIFEHOODUNLESS SHE HAD BEEN PALE AND FEATURELESS AND TAKEN EVERYTHINGFOR GRANTED.I THINK IT WAS YOU WHO WERE FIRST HASTY IN YOUR FALSE SUPPOSITIONSABOUT MY FEELING SAID DOROTHEA IN THE SAME TONE. THE FIRE WAS NOTDISSIPATED YET AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS IGNOBLE IN HER HUSBAND NOT TOAPOLOGIZE TO HER.WE WILL IF YOU PLEASE SAY NO MORE ON THIS SUBJECT DOROTHEA. I HAVENEITHER LEISURE NOR ENERGY FOR THIS KIND OF DEBATE.HERE MR. CASAUBON DIPPED HIS PEN AND MADE AS IF HE WOULD RETURN TO HISWRITING THOUGH HIS HAND TREMBLED SO MUCH THAT THE WORDS SEEMED TO BEWRITTEN IN AN UNKNOWN CHARACTER. THERE ARE ANSWERS WHICH IN TURNINGAWAY WRATH ONLY SEND IT TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM AND TO HAVE ADISCUSSION COOLLY WAIVED WHEN YOU FEEL THAT JUSTICE IS ALL ON YOUR OWNSIDE IS EVEN MORE EXASPERATING IN MARRIAGE THAN IN PHILOSOPHY.DOROTHEA LEFT LADISLAWS TWO LETTERS UNREAD ON HER HUSBANDSWRITINGTABLE AND WENT TO HER OWN PLACE THE SCORN AND INDIGNATIONWITHIN HER REJECTING THE READING OF THESE LETTERS JUST AS WE HURL AWAYANY TRASH TOWARDS WHICH WE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SUSPECTED OF MEANCUPIDITY. SHE DID NOT IN THE LEAST DIVINE THE SUBTLE SOURCES OF HERHUSBANDS BAD TEMPER ABOUT THESE LETTERS SHE ONLY KNEW THAT THEY HADCAUSED HIM TO OFFEND HER. SHE BEGAN TO WORK AT ONCE AND HER HAND DIDNOT TREMBLE ON THE CONTRARY IN WRITING OUT THE QUOTATIONS WHICH HADBEEN GIVEN TO HER THE DAY BEFORE SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS FORMING HERLETTERS BEAUTIFULLY AND IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE SAW THE CONSTRUCTIONOF THE LATIN SHE WAS COPYING AND WHICH SHE WAS BEGINNING TOUNDERSTAND MORE CLEARLY THAN USUAL. IN HER INDIGNATION THERE WAS ASENSE OF SUPERIORITY BUT IT WENT OUT FOR THE PRESENT IN FIRMNESS OFSTROKE AND DID NOT COMPRESS ITSELF INTO AN INWARD ARTICULATE VOICEPRONOUNCING THE ONCE AFFABLE ARCHANGEL A POOR CREATURE.THERE HAD BEEN THIS APPARENT QUIET FOR HALF AN HOUR AND DOROTHEA HADNOT LOOKED AWAY FROM HER OWN TABLE WHEN SHE HEARD THE LOUD BANG OF ABOOK ON THE FLOOR AND TURNING QUICKLY SAW MR. CASAUBON ON THE LIBRARYSTEPS CLINGING FORWARD AS IF HE WERE IN SOME BODILY DISTRESS. SHESTARTED UP AND BOUNDED TOWARDS HIM IN AN INSTANT HE WAS EVIDENTLY INGREAT STRAITS FOR BREATH. JUMPING ON A STOOL SHE GOT CLOSE TO HIS ELBOWAND SAID WITH HER WHOLE SOUL MELTED INTO TENDER ALARMCAN YOU LEAN ON ME DEARHE WAS STILL FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES WHICH SEEMED ENDLESS TO HERUNABLE TO SPEAK OR MOVE GASPING FOR BREATH. WHEN AT LAST HE DESCENDEDTHE THREE STEPS AND FELL BACKWARD IN THE LARGE CHAIR WHICH DOROTHEA HADDRAWN CLOSE TO THE FOOT OF THE LADDER HE NO LONGER GASPED BUT SEEMEDHELPLESS AND ABOUT TO FAINT. DOROTHEA RANG THE BELL VIOLENTLY ANDPRESENTLY MR. CASAUBON WAS HELPED TO THE COUCH HE DID NOT FAINT ANDWAS GRADUALLY REVIVING WHEN SIR JAMES CHETTAM CAME IN HAVING BEEN METIN THE HALL WITH THE NEWS THAT MR. CASAUBON HAD HAD A FIT IN THELIBRARY.GOOD GOD THIS IS JUST WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED WAS HISIMMEDIATE THOUGHT. IF HIS PROPHETIC SOUL HAD BEEN URGED TOPARTICULARIZE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT FITS WOULD HAVE BEEN THEDEFINITE EXPRESSION ALIGHTED UPON. HE ASKED HIS INFORMANT THE BUTLERWHETHER THE DOCTOR HAD BEEN SENT FOR. THE BUTLER NEVER KNEW HIS MASTERTO WANT THE DOCTOR BEFORE BUT WOULD IT NOT BE RIGHT TO SEND FOR APHYSICIANWHEN SIR JAMES ENTERED THE LIBRARY HOWEVER MR. CASAUBON COULD MAKESOME SIGNS OF HIS USUAL POLITENESS AND DOROTHEA WHO IN THE REACTIONFROM HER FIRST TERROR HAD BEEN KNEELING AND SOBBING BY HIS SIDE NOWROSE AND HERSELF PROPOSED THAT SOME ONE SHOULD RIDE OFF FOR A MEDICALMAN.I RECOMMEND YOU TO SEND FOR LYDGATE SAID SIR JAMES. MY MOTHER HASCALLED HIM IN AND SHE HAS FOUND HIM UNCOMMONLY CLEVER. SHE HAS HAD APOOR OPINION OF THE PHYSICIANS SINCE MY FATHERS DEATH.DOROTHEA APPEALED TO HER HUSBAND AND HE MADE A SILENT SIGN OFAPPROVAL. SO MR. LYDGATE WAS SENT FOR AND HE CAME WONDERFULLY SOON FORTHE MESSENGER WHO WAS SIR JAMES CHETTAMS MAN AND KNEW MR. LYDGATEMET HIM LEADING HIS HORSE ALONG THE LOWICK ROAD AND GIVING HIS ARM TOMISS VINCY.CELIA IN THE DRAWINGROOM HAD KNOWN NOTHING OF THE TROUBLE TILL SIRJAMES TOLD HER OF IT. AFTER DOROTHEAS ACCOUNT HE NO LONGER CONSIDEREDTHE ILLNESS A FIT BUT STILL SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE.POOR DEAR DODOHOW DREADFUL SAID CELIA FEELING AS MUCH GRIEVED ASHER OWN PERFECT HAPPINESS WOULD ALLOW. HER LITTLE HANDS WERE CLASPEDAND ENCLOSED BY SIR JAMESS AS A BUD IS ENFOLDED BY A LIBERAL CALYX.IT IS VERY SHOCKING THAT MR. CASAUBON SHOULD BE ILL BUT I NEVER DIDLIKE HIM. AND I THINK HE IS NOT HALF FOND ENOUGH OF DOROTHEA AND HEOUGHT TO BE FOR I AM SURE NO ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE HAD HIMDO YOU THINKTHEY WOULDI ALWAYS THOUGHT IT A HORRIBLE SACRIFICE OF YOUR SISTER SAID SIRJAMES.YES. BUT POOR DODO NEVER DID DO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DO AND I THINK SHENEVER WILL.SHE IS A NOBLE CREATURE SAID THE LOYALHEARTED SIR JAMES. HE HADJUST HAD A FRESH IMPRESSION OF THIS KIND AS HE HAD SEEN DOROTHEASTRETCHING HER TENDER ARM UNDER HER HUSBANDS NECK AND LOOKING AT HIMWITH UNSPEAKABLE SORROW. HE DID NOT KNOW HOW MUCH PENITENCE THERE WASIN THE SORROW.YES SAID CELIA THINKING IT WAS VERY WELL FOR SIR JAMES TO SAY SOBUT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN COMFORTABLE WITH DODO. SHALL I GO TO HERCOULD I HELP HER DO YOU THINKI THINK IT WOULD BE WELL FOR YOU JUST TO GO AND SEE HER BEFORE LYDGATECOMES SAID SIR JAMES MAGNANIMOUSLY. ONLY DONT STAY LONG.WHILE CELIA WAS GONE HE WALKED UP AND DOWN REMEMBERING WHAT HE HADORIGINALLY FELT ABOUT DOROTHEAS ENGAGEMENT AND FEELING A REVIVAL OFHIS DISGUST AT MR. BROOKES INDIFFERENCE. IF CADWALLADERIF EVERY ONEELSE HAD REGARDED THE AFFAIR AS HE SIR JAMES HAD DONE THE MARRIAGEMIGHT HAVE BEEN HINDERED. IT WAS WICKED TO LET A YOUNG GIRL BLINDLYDECIDE HER FATE IN THAT WAY WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SAVE HER. SIR JAMESHAD LONG CEASED TO HAVE ANY REGRETS ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT HIS HEART WASSATISFIED WITH HIS ENGAGEMENT TO CELIA. BUT HE HAD A CHIVALROUS NATUREWAS NOT THE DISINTERESTED SERVICE OF WOMAN AMONG THE IDEAL GLORIES OFOLD CHIVALRY HIS DISREGARDED LOVE HAD NOT TURNED TO BITTERNESS ITSDEATH HAD MADE SWEET ODORSFLOATING MEMORIES THAT CLUNG WITH ACONSECRATING EFFECT TO DOROTHEA. HE COULD REMAIN HER BROTHERLY FRIENDINTERPRETING HER ACTIONS WITH GENEROUS TRUSTFULNESS.CHAPTER XXX.QUI VEUT DLASSER HORS DE PROPOS LASSE.PASCAL.MR. CASAUBON HAD NO SECOND ATTACK OF EQUAL SEVERITY WITH THE FIRST ANDIN A FEW DAYS BEGAN TO RECOVER HIS USUAL CONDITION. BUT LYDGATE SEEMEDTO THINK THE CASE WORTH A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION. HE NOT ONLY USED HISSTETHOSCOPE WHICH HAD NOT BECOME A MATTER OF COURSE IN PRACTICE ATTHAT TIME BUT SAT QUIETLY BY HIS PATIENT AND WATCHED HIM. TO MR.CASAUBONS QUESTIONS ABOUT HIMSELF HE REPLIED THAT THE SOURCE OF THEILLNESS WAS THE COMMON ERROR OF INTELLECTUAL MENA TOO EAGER ANDMONOTONOUS APPLICATION THE REMEDY WAS TO BE SATISFIED WITH MODERATEWORK AND TO SEEK VARIETY OF RELAXATION. MR. BROOKE WHO SAT BY ON ONEOCCASION SUGGESTED THAT MR. CASAUBON SHOULD GO FISHING AS CADWALLADERDID AND HAVE A TURNINGROOM MAKE TOYS TABLELEGS AND THAT KIND OFTHING.IN SHORT YOU RECOMMEND ME TO ANTICIPATE THE ARRIVAL OF MY SECONDCHILDHOOD SAID POOR MR. CASAUBON WITH SOME BITTERNESS. THESETHINGS HE ADDED LOOKING AT LYDGATE WOULD BE TO ME SUCH RELAXATIONAS TOWPICKING IS TO PRISONERS IN A HOUSE OF CORRECTION.I CONFESS SAID LYDGATE SMILING AMUSEMENT IS RATHER ANUNSATISFACTORY PRESCRIPTION. IT IS SOMETHING LIKE TELLING PEOPLE TOKEEP UP THEIR SPIRITS. PERHAPS I HAD BETTER SAY THAT YOU MUST SUBMITTO BE MILDLY BORED RATHER THAN TO GO ON WORKING.YES YES SAID MR. BROOKE. GET DOROTHEA TO PLAY BACKGAMMON WITH YOUIN THE EVENINGS. AND SHUTTLECOCK NOWI DONT KNOW A FINER GAME THANSHUTTLECOCK FOR THE DAYTIME. I REMEMBER IT ALL THE FASHION. TO BE SUREYOUR EYES MIGHT NOT STAND THAT CASAUBON. BUT YOU MUST UNBEND YOUKNOW. WHY YOU MIGHT TAKE TO SOME LIGHT STUDY CONCHOLOGY NOW IALWAYS THINK THAT MUST BE A LIGHT STUDY. OR GET DOROTHEA TO READ YOULIGHT THINGS SMOLLETTRODERICK RANDOM HUMPHREY CLINKER THEY AREA LITTLE BROAD BUT SHE MAY READ ANYTHING NOW SHES MARRIED YOU KNOW.I REMEMBER THEY MADE ME LAUGH UNCOMMONLYTHERES A DROLL BIT ABOUT APOSTILIONS BREECHES. WE HAVE NO SUCH HUMOR NOW. I HAVE GONE THROUGHALL THESE THINGS BUT THEY MIGHT BE RATHER NEW TO YOU.AS NEW AS EATING THISTLES WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ANSWER TO REPRESENT MR.CASAUBONS FEELINGS. BUT HE ONLY BOWED RESIGNEDLY WITH DUE RESPECT TOHIS WIFES UNCLE AND OBSERVED THAT DOUBTLESS THE WORKS HE MENTIONEDHAD SERVED AS A RESOURCE TO A CERTAIN ORDER OF MINDS.YOU SEE SAID THE ABLE MAGISTRATE TO LYDGATE WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDETHE DOOR CASAUBON HAS BEEN A LITTLE NARROW IT LEAVES HIM RATHER AT ALOSS WHEN YOU FORBID HIM HIS PARTICULAR WORK WHICH I BELIEVE ISSOMETHING VERY DEEP INDEEDIN THE LINE OF RESEARCH YOU KNOW. I WOULDNEVER GIVE WAY TO THAT I WAS ALWAYS VERSATILE. BUT A CLERGYMAN IS TIEDA LITTLE TIGHT. IF THEY WOULD MAKE HIM A BISHOP NOWHE DID A VERYGOOD PAMPHLET FOR PEEL. HE WOULD HAVE MORE MOVEMENT THEN MORE SHOW HEMIGHT GET A LITTLE FLESH. BUT I RECOMMEND YOU TO TALK TO MRS. CASAUBON.SHE IS CLEVER ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING IS MY NIECE. TELL HER HER HUSBANDWANTS LIVELINESS DIVERSION PUT HER ON AMUSING TACTICS.WITHOUT MR. BROOKES ADVICE LYDGATE HAD DETERMINED ON SPEAKING TODOROTHEA. SHE HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT WHILE HER UNCLE WAS THROWING OUT HISPLEASANT SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE MODE IN WHICH LIFE AT LOWICK MIGHT BEENLIVENED BUT SHE WAS USUALLY BY HER HUSBANDS SIDE AND THEUNAFFECTED SIGNS OF INTENSE ANXIETY IN HER FACE AND VOICE ABOUTWHATEVER TOUCHED HIS MIND OR HEALTH MADE A DRAMA WHICH LYDGATE WASINCLINED TO WATCH. HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS ONLY DOING RIGHT INTELLING HER THE TRUTH ABOUT HER HUSBANDS PROBABLE FUTURE BUT HECERTAINLY THOUGHT ALSO THAT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO TALKCONFIDENTIALLY WITH HER. A MEDICAL MAN LIKES TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGICALOBSERVATIONS AND SOMETIMES IN THE PURSUIT OF SUCH STUDIES IS TOOEASILY TEMPTED INTO MOMENTOUS PROPHECY WHICH LIFE AND DEATH EASILY SETAT NOUGHT. LYDGATE HAD OFTEN BEEN SATIRICAL ON THIS GRATUITOUSPREDICTION AND HE MEANT NOW TO BE GUARDED.HE ASKED FOR MRS. CASAUBON BUT BEING TOLD THAT SHE WAS OUT WALKING HEWAS GOING AWAY WHEN DOROTHEA AND CELIA APPEARED BOTH GLOWING FROMTHEIR STRUGGLE WITH THE MARCH WIND. WHEN LYDGATE BEGGED TO SPEAK WITHHER ALONE DOROTHEA OPENED THE LIBRARY DOOR WHICH HAPPENED TO BE THENEAREST THINKING OF NOTHING AT THE MOMENT BUT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TOSAY ABOUT MR. CASAUBON. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD ENTERED THIS ROOMSINCE HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN TAKEN ILL AND THE SERVANT HAD CHOSEN NOT TOOPEN THE SHUTTERS. BUT THERE WAS LIGHT ENOUGH TO READ BY FROM THENARROW UPPER PANES OF THE WINDOWS.YOU WILL NOT MIND THIS SOMBRE LIGHT SAID DOROTHEA STANDING IN THEMIDDLE OF THE ROOM. SINCE YOU FORBADE BOOKS THE LIBRARY HAS BEEN OUTOF THE QUESTION. BUT MR. CASAUBON WILL SOON BE HERE AGAIN I HOPE. ISHE NOT MAKING PROGRESSYES MUCH MORE RAPID PROGRESS THAN I AT FIRST EXPECTED. INDEED HE ISALREADY NEARLY IN HIS USUAL STATE OF HEALTH.YOU DO NOT FEAR THAT THE ILLNESS WILL RETURN SAID DOROTHEA WHOSEQUICK EAR HAD DETECTED SOME SIGNIFICANCE IN LYDGATES TONE.SUCH CASES ARE PECULIARLY DIFFICULT TO PRONOUNCE UPON SAID LYDGATE.THE ONLY POINT ON WHICH I CAN BE CONFIDENT IS THAT IT WILL BEDESIRABLE TO BE VERY WATCHFUL ON MR. CASAUBONS ACCOUNT LEST HE SHOULDIN ANY WAY STRAIN HIS NERVOUS POWER.I BESEECH YOU TO SPEAK QUITE PLAINLY SAID DOROTHEA IN AN IMPLORINGTONE. I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING WHICH I DIDNOT KNOW AND WHICH IF I HAD KNOWN IT WOULD HAVE MADE ME ACTDIFFERENTLY. THE WORDS CAME OUT LIKE A CRY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEYWERE THE VOICE OF SOME MENTAL EXPERIENCE WHICH LAY NOT VERY FAR OFF.SIT DOWN SHE ADDED PLACING HERSELF ON THE NEAREST CHAIR ANDTHROWING OFF HER BONNET AND GLOVES WITH AN INSTINCTIVE DISCARDING OFFORMALITY WHERE A GREAT QUESTION OF DESTINY WAS CONCERNED.WHAT YOU SAY NOW JUSTIFIES MY OWN VIEW SAID LYDGATE. I THINK IT ISONES FUNCTION AS A MEDICAL MAN TO HINDER REGRETS OF THAT SORT AS FARAS POSSIBLE. BUT I BEG YOU TO OBSERVE THAT MR. CASAUBONS CASE ISPRECISELY OF THE KIND IN WHICH THE ISSUE IS MOST DIFFICULT TO PRONOUNCEUPON. HE MAY POSSIBLY LIVE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS OR MORE WITHOUT MUCHWORSE HEALTH THAN HE HAS HAD HITHERTO.DOROTHEA HAD TURNED VERY PALE AND WHEN LYDGATE PAUSED SHE SAID IN ALOW VOICE YOU MEAN IF WE ARE VERY CAREFUL.YESCAREFUL AGAINST MENTAL AGITATION OF ALL KINDS AND AGAINSTEXCESSIVE APPLICATION.HE WOULD BE MISERABLE IF HE HAD TO GIVE UP HIS WORK SAID DOROTHEAWITH A QUICK PREVISION OF THAT WRETCHEDNESS.I AM AWARE OF THAT. THE ONLY COURSE IS TO TRY BY ALL MEANS DIRECT ANDINDIRECT TO MODERATE AND VARY HIS OCCUPATIONS. WITH A HAPPYCONCURRENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS AS I SAID NO IMMEDIATE DANGERFROM THAT AFFECTION OF THE HEART WHICH I BELIEVE TO HAVE BEEN THECAUSE OF HIS LATE ATTACK. ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEDISEASE MAY DEVELOP ITSELF MORE RAPIDLY IT IS ONE OF THOSE CASES INWHICH DEATH IS SOMETIMES SUDDEN. NOTHING SHOULD BE NEGLECTED WHICHMIGHT BE AFFECTED BY SUCH AN ISSUE.THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A FEW MOMENTS WHILE DOROTHEA SAT AS IF SHE HADBEEN TURNED TO MARBLE THOUGH THE LIFE WITHIN HER WAS SO INTENSE THATHER MIND HAD NEVER BEFORE SWEPT IN BRIEF TIME OVER AN EQUAL RANGE OFSCENES AND MOTIVES.HELP ME PRAY SHE SAID AT LAST IN THE SAME LOW VOICE AS BEFORE.TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO.WHAT DO YOU THINK OF FOREIGN TRAVEL YOU HAVE BEEN LATELY IN ROME ITHINK.THE MEMORIES WHICH MADE THIS RESOURCE UTTERLY HOPELESS WERE A NEWCURRENT THAT SHOOK DOROTHEA OUT OF HER PALLID IMMOBILITY.OH THAT WOULD NOT DOTHAT WOULD BE WORSE THAN ANYTHING SHE SAIDWITH A MORE CHILDLIKE DESPONDENCY WHILE THE TEARS ROLLED DOWN.NOTHING WILL BE OF ANY USE THAT HE DOES NOT ENJOY.I WISH THAT I COULD HAVE SPARED YOU THIS PAIN SAID LYDGATE DEEPLYTOUCHED YET WONDERING ABOUT HER MARRIAGE. WOMEN JUST LIKE DOROTHEA HADNOT ENTERED INTO HIS TRADITIONS.IT WAS RIGHT OF YOU TO TELL ME. I THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME THE TRUTH.I WISH YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT I SHALL NOT SAY ANYTHING TO ENLIGHTENMR. CASAUBON HIMSELF. I THINK IT DESIRABLE FOR HIM TO KNOW NOTHING MORETHAN THAT HE MUST NOT OVERWORK HIMSELF AND MUST OBSERVE CERTAIN RULES.ANXIETY OF ANY KIND WOULD BE PRECISELY THE MOST UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONFOR HIM.LYDGATE ROSE AND DOROTHEA MECHANICALLY ROSE AT THE SAME TIMEUNCLASPING HER CLOAK AND THROWING IT OFF AS IF IT STIFLED HER. HE WASBOWING AND QUITTING HER WHEN AN IMPULSE WHICH IF SHE HAD BEEN ALONEWOULD HAVE TURNED INTO A PRAYER MADE HER SAY WITH A SOB IN HER VOICEOH YOU ARE A WISE MAN ARE YOU NOT YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT LIFE ANDDEATH. ADVISE ME. THINK WHAT I CAN DO. HE HAS BEEN LABORING ALL HISLIFE AND LOOKING FORWARD. HE MINDS ABOUT NOTHING ELSE. AND I MINDABOUT NOTHING ELSEFOR YEARS AFTER LYDGATE REMEMBERED THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED IN HIM BYTHIS INVOLUNTARY APPEALTHIS CRY FROM SOUL TO SOUL WITHOUT OTHERCONSCIOUSNESS THAN THEIR MOVING WITH KINDRED NATURES IN THE SAMEEMBROILED MEDIUM THE SAME TROUBLOUS FITFULLY ILLUMINATED LIFE. BUTWHAT COULD HE SAY NOW EXCEPT THAT HE SHOULD SEE MR. CASAUBON AGAINTOMORROWWHEN HE WAS GONE DOROTHEAS TEARS GUSHED FORTH AND RELIEVED HERSTIFLING OPPRESSION. THEN SHE DRIED HER EYES REMINDED THAT HERDISTRESS MUST NOT BE BETRAYED TO HER HUSBAND AND LOOKED ROUND THE ROOMTHINKING THAT SHE MUST ORDER THE SERVANT TO ATTEND TO IT AS USUALSINCE MR. CASAUBON MIGHT NOW AT ANY MOMENT WISH TO ENTER. ON HISWRITINGTABLE THERE WERE LETTERS WHICH HAD LAIN UNTOUCHED SINCE THEMORNING WHEN HE WAS TAKEN ILL AND AMONG THEM AS DOROTHEA WELLREMEMBERED THERE WERE YOUNG LADISLAWS LETTERS THE ONE ADDRESSED TOHER STILL UNOPENED. THE ASSOCIATIONS OF THESE LETTERS HAD BEEN MADE THEMORE PAINFUL BY THAT SUDDEN ATTACK OF ILLNESS WHICH SHE FELT THAT THEAGITATION CAUSED BY HER ANGER MIGHT HAVE HELPED TO BRING ON IT WOULDBE TIME ENOUGH TO READ THEM WHEN THEY WERE AGAIN THRUST UPON HER ANDSHE HAD HAD NO INCLINATION TO FETCH THEM FROM THE LIBRARY. BUT NOW ITOCCURRED TO HER THAT THEY SHOULD BE PUT OUT OF HER HUSBANDS SIGHTWHATEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE SOURCES OF HIS ANNOYANCE ABOUT THEM HEMUST IF POSSIBLE NOT BE ANNOYED AGAIN AND SHE RAN HER EYES FIRSTOVER THE LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIM TO ASSURE HERSELF WHETHER OR NOT ITWOULD BE NECESSARY TO WRITE IN ORDER TO HINDER THE OFFENSIVE VISIT.WILL WROTE FROM ROME AND BEGAN BY SAYING THAT HIS OBLIGATIONS TO MR.CASAUBON WERE TOO DEEP FOR ALL THANKS NOT TO SEEM IMPERTINENT. IT WASPLAIN THAT IF HE WERE NOT GRATEFUL HE MUST BE THE POORESTSPIRITEDRASCAL WHO HAD EVER FOUND A GENEROUS FRIEND. TO EXPAND IN WORDY THANKSWOULD BE LIKE SAYING I AM HONEST. BUT WILL HAD COME TO PERCEIVE THATHIS DEFECTSDEFECTS WHICH MR. CASAUBON HAD HIMSELF OFTEN POINTEDTONEEDED FOR THEIR CORRECTION THAT MORE STRENUOUS POSITION WHICH HISRELATIVES GENEROSITY HAD HITHERTO PREVENTED FROM BEING INEVITABLE. HETRUSTED THAT HE SHOULD MAKE THE BEST RETURN IF RETURN WERE POSSIBLEBY SHOWING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EDUCATION FOR WHICH HE WASINDEBTED AND BY CEASING IN FUTURE TO NEED ANY DIVERSION TOWARDSHIMSELF OF FUNDS ON WHICH OTHERS MIGHT HAVE A BETTER CLAIM. HE WASCOMING TO ENGLAND TO TRY HIS FORTUNE AS MANY OTHER YOUNG MEN WEREOBLIGED TO DO WHOSE ONLY CAPITAL WAS IN THEIR BRAINS. HIS FRIENDNAUMANN HAD DESIRED HIM TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE DISPUTETHE PICTUREPAINTED FOR MR. CASAUBON WITH WHOSE PERMISSION AND MRS. CASAUBONSWILL WOULD CONVEY IT TO LOWICK IN PERSON. A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THEPOSTE RESTANTE IN PARIS WITHIN THE FORTNIGHT WOULD HINDER HIM IFNECESSARY FROM ARRIVING AT AN INCONVENIENT MOMENT. HE ENCLOSED ALETTER TO MRS. CASAUBON IN WHICH HE CONTINUED A DISCUSSION ABOUT ARTBEGUN WITH HER IN ROME.OPENING HER OWN LETTER DOROTHEA SAW THAT IT WAS A LIVELY CONTINUATIONOF HIS REMONSTRANCE WITH HER FANATICAL SYMPATHY AND HER WANT OF STURDYNEUTRAL DELIGHT IN THINGS AS THEY WEREAN OUTPOURING OF HIS YOUNGVIVACITY WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO READ JUST NOW. SHE HAD IMMEDIATELYTO CONSIDER WHAT WAS TO BE DONE ABOUT THE OTHER LETTER THERE WAS STILLTIME PERHAPS TO PREVENT WILL FROM COMING TO LOWICK. DOROTHEA ENDED BYGIVING THE LETTER TO HER UNCLE WHO WAS STILL IN THE HOUSE AND BEGGINGHIM TO LET WILL KNOW THAT MR. CASAUBON HAD BEEN ILL AND THAT HISHEALTH WOULD NOT ALLOW THE RECEPTION OF ANY VISITORS.NO ONE MORE READY THAN MR. BROOKE TO WRITE A LETTER HIS ONLYDIFFICULTY WAS TO WRITE A SHORT ONE AND HIS IDEAS IN THIS CASEEXPANDED OVER THE THREE LARGE PAGES AND THE INWARD FOLDINGS. HE HADSIMPLY SAID TO DOROTHEATO BE SURE I WILL WRITE MY DEAR. HES A VERY CLEVER YOUNGFELLOWTHIS YOUNG LADISLAWI DARE SAY WILL BE A RISING YOUNG MAN. ITSA GOOD LETTERMARKS HIS SENSE OF THINGS YOU KNOW. HOWEVER I WILL TELLHIM ABOUT CASAUBON.BUT THE END OF MR. BROOKES PEN WAS A THINKING ORGAN EVOLVINGSENTENCES ESPECIALLY OF A BENEVOLENT KIND BEFORE THE REST OF HIS MINDCOULD WELL OVERTAKE THEM. IT EXPRESSED REGRETS AND PROPOSED REMEDIESWHICH WHEN MR. BROOKE READ THEM SEEMED FELICITOUSLYWORDEDSURPRISINGLY THE RIGHT THING AND DETERMINED A SEQUEL WHICH HEHAD NEVER BEFORE THOUGHT OF. IN THIS CASE HIS PEN FOUND IT SUCH A PITYYOUNG LADISLAW SHOULD NOT HAVE COME INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD JUST AT THATTIME IN ORDER THAT MR. BROOKE MIGHT MAKE HIS ACQUAINTANCE MORE FULLYAND THAT THEY MIGHT GO OVER THE LONGNEGLECTED ITALIAN DRAWINGSTOGETHERIT ALSO FELT SUCH AN INTEREST IN A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS STARTINGIN LIFE WITH A STOCK OF IDEASTHAT BY THE END OF THE SECOND PAGE IT HADPERSUADED MR. BROOKE TO INVITE YOUNG LADISLAW SINCE HE COULD NOT BERECEIVED AT LOWICK TO COME TO TIPTON GRANGE. WHY NOT THEY COULD FINDA GREAT MANY THINGS TO DO TOGETHER AND THIS WAS A PERIOD OF PECULIARGROWTHTHE POLITICAL HORIZON WAS EXPANDING ANDIN SHORT MR. BROOKESPEN WENT OFF INTO A LITTLE SPEECH WHICH IT HAD LATELY REPORTED FOR THATIMPERFECTLY EDITED ORGAN THE MIDDLEMARCH PIONEER. WHILE MR. BROOKEWAS SEALING THIS LETTER HE FELT ELATED WITH AN INFLUX OF DIMPROJECTSA YOUNG MAN CAPABLE OF PUTTING IDEAS INTO FORM THE PIONEERPURCHASED TO CLEAR THE PATHWAY FOR A NEW CANDIDATE DOCUMENTSUTILIZEDWHO KNEW WHAT MIGHT COME OF IT ALL SINCE CELIA WAS GOING TOMARRY IMMEDIATELY IT WOULD BE VERY PLEASANT TO HAVE A YOUNG FELLOW ATTABLE WITH HIM AT LEAST FOR A TIME.BUT HE WENT AWAY WITHOUT TELLING DOROTHEA WHAT HE HAD PUT INTO THELETTER FOR SHE WAS ENGAGED WITH HER HUSBAND ANDIN FACT THESE THINGSWERE OF NO IMPORTANCE TO HER.CHAPTER XXXI.HOW WILL YOU KNOW THE PITCH OF THAT GREAT BELLTOO LARGE FOR YOU TO STIR LET BUT A FLUTEPLAY NEATH THE FINEMIXED METAL LISTEN CLOSETILL THE RIGHT NOTE FLOWS FORTH A SILVERY RILLTHEN SHALL THE HUGE BELL TREMBLETHEN THE MASSWITH MYRIAD WAVES CONCURRENT SHALL RESPONDIN LOW SOFT UNISON.LYDGATE THAT EVENING SPOKE TO MISS VINCY OF MRS. CASAUBON AND LAIDSOME EMPHASIS ON THE STRONG FEELING SHE APPEARED TO HAVE FOR THATFORMAL STUDIOUS MAN THIRTY YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF.OF COURSE SHE IS DEVOTED TO HER HUSBAND SAID ROSAMOND IMPLYING ANOTION OF NECESSARY SEQUENCE WHICH THE SCIENTIFIC MAN REGARDED AS THEPRETTIEST POSSIBLE FOR A WOMAN BUT SHE WAS THINKING AT THE SAME TIMETHAT IT WAS NOT SO VERY MELANCHOLY TO BE MISTRESS OF LOWICK MANOR WITHA HUSBAND LIKELY TO DIE SOON. DO YOU THINK HER VERY HANDSOMESHE CERTAINLY IS HANDSOME BUT I HAVE NOT THOUGHT ABOUT IT SAIDLYDGATE.I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE UNPROFESSIONAL SAID ROSAMOND DIMPLING. BUTHOW YOUR PRACTICE IS SPREADING YOU WERE CALLED IN BEFORE TO THECHETTAMS I THINK AND NOW THE CASAUBONS.YES SAID LYDGATE IN A TONE OF COMPULSORY ADMISSION. BUT I DONTREALLY LIKE ATTENDING SUCH PEOPLE SO WELL AS THE POOR. THE CASES AREMORE MONOTONOUS AND ONE HAS TO GO THROUGH MORE FUSS AND LISTEN MOREDEFERENTIALLY TO NONSENSE.NOT MORE THAN IN MIDDLEMARCH SAID ROSAMOND. AND AT LEAST YOU GOTHROUGH WIDE CORRIDORS AND HAVE THE SCENT OF ROSELEAVES EVERYWHERE.THAT IS TRUE MADEMOISELLE DE MONTMORENCI SAID LYDGATE JUST BENDINGHIS HEAD TO THE TABLE AND LIFTING WITH HIS FOURTH FINGER HER DELICATEHANDKERCHIEF WHICH LAY AT THE MOUTH OF HER RETICULE AS IF TO ENJOY ITSSCENT WHILE HE LOOKED AT HER WITH A SMILE.BUT THIS AGREEABLE HOLIDAY FREEDOM WITH WHICH LYDGATE HOVERED ABOUT THEFLOWER OF MIDDLEMARCH COULD NOT CONTINUE INDEFINITELY. IT WAS NOT MOREPOSSIBLE TO FIND SOCIAL ISOLATION IN THAT TOWN THAN ELSEWHERE AND TWOPEOPLE PERSISTENTLY FLIRTING COULD BY NO MEANS ESCAPE FROM THE VARIOUSENTANGLEMENTS WEIGHTS BLOWS CLASHINGS MOTIONS BY WHICH THINGSSEVERALLY GO ON. WHATEVER MISS VINCY DID MUST BE REMARKED AND SHE WASPERHAPS THE MORE CONSPICUOUS TO ADMIRERS AND CRITICS BECAUSE JUST NOWMRS. VINCY AFTER SOME STRUGGLE HAD GONE WITH FRED TO STAY A LITTLEWHILE AT STONE COURT THERE BEING NO OTHER WAY OF AT ONCE GRATIFYINGOLD FEATHERSTONE AND KEEPING WATCH AGAINST MARY GARTH WHO APPEARED ALESS TOLERABLE DAUGHTERINLAW IN PROPORTION AS FREDS ILLNESSDISAPPEARED.AUNT BULSTRODE FOR EXAMPLE CAME A LITTLE OFTENER INTO LOWICK GATE TOSEE ROSAMOND NOW SHE WAS ALONE. FOR MRS. BULSTRODE HAD A TRUE SISTERLYFEELING FOR HER BROTHER ALWAYS THINKING THAT HE MIGHT HAVE MARRIEDBETTER BUT WISHING WELL TO THE CHILDREN. NOW MRS. BULSTRODE HAD ALONGSTANDING INTIMACY WITH MRS. PLYMDALE. THEY HAD NEARLY THE SAMEPREFERENCES IN SILKS PATTERNS FOR UNDERCLOTHING CHINAWARE ANDCLERGYMEN THEY CONFIDED THEIR LITTLE TROUBLES OF HEALTH AND HOUSEHOLDMANAGEMENT TO EACH OTHER AND VARIOUS LITTLE POINTS OF SUPERIORITY ONMRS. BULSTRODES SIDE NAMELY MORE DECIDED SERIOUSNESS MOREADMIRATION FOR MIND AND A HOUSE OUTSIDE THE TOWN SOMETIMES SERVED TOGIVE COLOR TO THEIR CONVERSATION WITHOUT DIVIDING THEMWELLMEANINGWOMEN BOTH KNOWING VERY LITTLE OF THEIR OWN MOTIVES.MRS. BULSTRODE PAYING A MORNING VISIT TO MRS. PLYMDALE HAPPENED TOSAY THAT SHE COULD NOT STAY LONGER BECAUSE SHE WAS GOING TO SEE POORROSAMOND.WHY DO YOU SAY POOR ROSAMOND SAID MRS. PLYMDALE A ROUNDEYEDSHARP LITTLE WOMAN LIKE A TAMED FALCON.SHE IS SO PRETTY AND HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP IN SUCH THOUGHTLESSNESS. THEMOTHER YOU KNOW HAD ALWAYS THAT LEVITY ABOUT HER WHICH MAKES MEANXIOUS FOR THE CHILDREN.WELL HARRIET IF I AM TO SPEAK MY MIND SAID MRS. PLYMDALE WITHEMPHASIS I MUST SAY ANYBODY WOULD SUPPOSE YOU AND MR. BULSTRODEWOULD BE DELIGHTED WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED FOR YOU HAVE DONE EVERYTHINGTO PUT MR. LYDGATE FORWARD.SELINA WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID MRS. BULSTRODE IN GENUINE SURPRISE.NOT BUT WHAT I AM TRULY THANKFUL FOR NEDS SAKE SAID MRS. PLYMDALE.HE COULD CERTAINLY BETTER AFFORD TO KEEP SUCH A WIFE THAN SOME PEOPLECAN BUT I SHOULD WISH HIM TO LOOK ELSEWHERE. STILL A MOTHER HASANXIETIES AND SOME YOUNG MEN WOULD TAKE TO A BAD LIFE IN CONSEQUENCE.BESIDES IF I WAS OBLIGED TO SPEAK I SHOULD SAY I WAS NOT FOND OFSTRANGERS COMING INTO A TOWN.I DONT KNOW SELINA SAID MRS. BULSTRODE WITH A LITTLE EMPHASIS INHER TURN. MR. BULSTRODE WAS A STRANGER HERE AT ONE TIME. ABRAHAM ANDMOSES WERE STRANGERS IN THE LAND AND WE ARE TOLD TO ENTERTAINSTRANGERS. AND ESPECIALLY SHE ADDED AFTER A SLIGHT PAUSE WHEN THEYARE UNEXCEPTIONABLE.I WAS NOT SPEAKING IN A RELIGIOUS SENSE HARRIET. I SPOKE AS AMOTHER.SELINA I AM SURE YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD ME SAY ANYTHING AGAINST A NIECEOF MINE MARRYING YOUR SON.OH IT IS PRIDE IN MISS VINCYI AM SURE IT IS NOTHING ELSE SAID MRS.PLYMDALE WHO HAD NEVER BEFORE GIVEN ALL HER CONFIDENCE TO HARRIET ONTHIS SUBJECT. NO YOUNG MAN IN MIDDLEMARCH WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER IHAVE HEARD HER MOTHER SAY AS MUCH. THAT IS NOT A CHRISTIAN SPIRIT ITHINK. BUT NOW FROM ALL I HEAR SHE HAS FOUND A MAN AS PROUD ASHERSELF.YOU DONT MEAN THAT THERE IS ANYTHING BETWEEN ROSAMOND AND MR.LYDGATE SAID MRS. BULSTRODE RATHER MORTIFIED AT FINDING OUT HER OWNIGNORANCE.IS IT POSSIBLE YOU DONT KNOW HARRIETOH I GO ABOUT SO LITTLE AND I AM NOT FOND OF GOSSIP I REALLY NEVERHEAR ANY. YOU SEE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT I DONT SEE. YOUR CIRCLE ISRATHER DIFFERENT FROM OURS.WELL BUT YOUR OWN NIECE AND MR. BULSTRODES GREAT FAVORITEAND YOURSTOO I AM SURE HARRIET I THOUGHT AT ONE TIME YOU MEANT HIM FORKATE WHEN SHE IS A LITTLE OLDER.I DONT BELIEVE THERE CAN BE ANYTHING SERIOUS AT PRESENT SAID MRS.BULSTRODE. MY BROTHER WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TOLD ME.WELL PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT NOBODY CAN SEEMISS VINCY AND MR. LYDGATE TOGETHER WITHOUT TAKING THEM TO BE ENGAGED.HOWEVER IT IS NOT MY BUSINESS. SHALL I PUT UP THE PATTERN OF MITTENSAFTER THIS MRS. BULSTRODE DROVE TO HER NIECE WITH A MIND NEWLYWEIGHTED. SHE WAS HERSELF HANDSOMELY DRESSED BUT SHE NOTICED WITH ALITTLE MORE REGRET THAN USUAL THAT ROSAMOND WHO WAS JUST COME IN ANDMET HER IN WALKINGDRESS WAS ALMOST AS EXPENSIVELY EQUIPPED. MRS.BULSTRODE WAS A FEMININE SMALLER EDITION OF HER BROTHER AND HAD NONEOF HER HUSBANDS LOWTONED PALLOR. SHE HAD A GOOD HONEST GLANCE ANDUSED NO CIRCUMLOCUTION.YOU ARE ALONE I SEE MY DEAR SHE SAID AS THEY ENTERED THEDRAWINGROOM TOGETHER LOOKING ROUND GRAVELY. ROSAMOND FELT SURE THATHER AUNT HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO SAY AND THEY SAT DOWN NEAR EACHOTHER. NEVERTHELESS THE QUILLING INSIDE ROSAMONDS BONNET WAS SOCHARMING THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO DESIRE THE SAME KIND OF THINGFOR KATE AND MRS. BULSTRODES EYES WHICH WERE RATHER FINE ROLLEDROUND THAT AMPLE QUILLED CIRCUIT WHILE SHE SPOKE.I HAVE JUST HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT YOU THAT HAS SURPRISED ME VERY MUCHROSAMOND.WHAT IS THAT AUNT ROSAMONDS EYES ALSO WERE ROAMING OVER HER AUNTSLARGE EMBROIDERED COLLAR.I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE ITTHAT YOU SHOULD BE ENGAGED WITHOUT MY KNOWINGITWITHOUT YOUR FATHERS TELLING ME. HERE MRS. BULSTRODES EYESFINALLY RESTED ON ROSAMONDS WHO BLUSHED DEEPLY AND SAIDI AM NOT ENGAGED AUNT.HOW IS IT THAT EVERY ONE SAYS SO THENTHAT IT IS THE TOWNS TALKTHE TOWNS TALK IS OF VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE I THINK SAIDROSAMOND INWARDLY GRATIFIED.OH MY DEAR BE MORE THOUGHTFUL DONT DESPISE YOUR NEIGHBORS SO.REMEMBER YOU ARE TURNED TWENTYTWO NOW AND YOU WILL HAVE NO FORTUNEYOUR FATHER I AM SURE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SPARE YOU ANYTHING. MR.LYDGATE IS VERY INTELLECTUAL AND CLEVER I KNOW THERE IS AN ATTRACTIONIN THAT. I LIKE TALKING TO SUCH MEN MYSELF AND YOUR UNCLE FINDS HIMVERY USEFUL. BUT THE PROFESSION IS A POOR ONE HERE. TO BE SURE THISLIFE IS NOT EVERYTHING BUT IT IS SELDOM A MEDICAL MAN HAS TRUERELIGIOUS VIEWSTHERE IS TOO MUCH PRIDE OF INTELLECT. AND YOU ARE NOTFIT TO MARRY A POOR MAN.MR. LYDGATE IS NOT A POOR MAN AUNT. HE HAS VERY HIGH CONNECTIONS.HE TOLD ME HIMSELF HE WAS POOR.THAT IS BECAUSE HE IS USED TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE A HIGH STYLE OF LIVING.MY DEAR ROSAMOND YOU MUST NOT THINK OF LIVING IN HIGH STYLE.ROSAMOND LOOKED DOWN AND PLAYED WITH HER RETICULE. SHE WAS NOT A FIERYYOUNG LADY AND HAD NO SHARP ANSWERS BUT SHE MEANT TO LIVE AS SHEPLEASED.THEN IT IS REALLY TRUE SAID MRS. BULSTRODE LOOKING VERY EARNESTLYAT HER NIECE. YOU ARE THINKING OF MR. LYDGATETHERE IS SOMEUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN YOU THOUGH YOUR FATHER DOESNT KNOW. BE OPEN MYDEAR ROSAMOND MR. LYDGATE HAS REALLY MADE YOU AN OFFERPOOR ROSAMONDS FEELINGS WERE VERY UNPLEASANT. SHE HAD BEEN QUITE EASYAS TO LYDGATES FEELING AND INTENTION BUT NOW WHEN HER AUNT PUT THISQUESTION SHE DID NOT LIKE BEING UNABLE TO SAY YES. HER PRIDE WAS HURTBUT HER HABITUAL CONTROL OF MANNER HELPED HER.PRAY EXCUSE ME AUNT. I WOULD RATHER NOT SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT.YOU WOULD NOT GIVE YOUR HEART TO A MAN WITHOUT A DECIDED PROSPECT ITRUST MY DEAR. AND THINK OF THE TWO EXCELLENT OFFERS I KNOW OF THATYOU HAVE REFUSEDAND ONE STILL WITHIN YOUR REACH IF YOU WILL NOTTHROW IT AWAY. I KNEW A VERY GREAT BEAUTY WHO MARRIED BADLY AT LAST BYDOING SO. MR. NED PLYMDALE IS A NICE YOUNG MANSOME MIGHT THINKGOODLOOKING AND AN ONLY SON AND A LARGE BUSINESS OF THAT KIND ISBETTER THAN A PROFESSION. NOT THAT MARRYING IS EVERYTHING. I WOULD HAVEYOU SEEK FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD. BUT A GIRL SHOULD KEEP HER HEARTWITHIN HER OWN POWER.I SHOULD NEVER GIVE IT TO MR. NED PLYMDALE IF IT WERE. I HAVE ALREADYREFUSED HIM. IF I LOVED I SHOULD LOVE AT ONCE AND WITHOUT CHANGESAID ROSAMOND WITH A GREAT SENSE OF BEING A ROMANTIC HEROINE ANDPLAYING THE PART PRETTILY.I SEE HOW IT IS MY DEAR SAID MRS. BULSTRODE IN A MELANCHOLY VOICERISING TO GO. YOU HAVE ALLOWED YOUR AFFECTIONS TO BE ENGAGED WITHOUTRETURN.NO INDEED AUNT SAID ROSAMOND WITH EMPHASIS.THEN YOU ARE QUITE CONFIDENT THAT MR. LYDGATE HAS A SERIOUS ATTACHMENTTO YOUROSAMONDS CHEEKS BY THIS TIME WERE PERSISTENTLY BURNING AND SHE FELTMUCH MORTIFICATION. SHE CHOSE TO BE SILENT AND HER AUNT WENT AWAY ALLTHE MORE CONVINCED.MR. BULSTRODE IN THINGS WORLDLY AND INDIFFERENT WAS DISPOSED TO DO WHATHIS WIFE BADE HIM AND SHE NOW WITHOUT TELLING HER REASONS DESIREDHIM ON THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OUT IN CONVERSATION WITH MR.LYDGATE WHETHER HE HAD ANY INTENTION OF MARRYING SOON. THE RESULT WAS ADECIDED NEGATIVE. MR. BULSTRODE ON BEING CROSSQUESTIONED SHOWED THATLYDGATE HAD SPOKEN AS NO MAN WOULD WHO HAD ANY ATTACHMENT THAT COULDISSUE IN MATRIMONY. MRS. BULSTRODE NOW FELT THAT SHE HAD A SERIOUS DUTYBEFORE HER AND SHE SOON MANAGED TO ARRANGE A TTETTE WITHLYDGATE IN WHICH SHE PASSED FROM INQUIRIES ABOUT FRED VINCYS HEALTHAND EXPRESSIONS OF HER SINCERE ANXIETY FOR HER BROTHERS LARGE FAMILYTO GENERAL REMARKS ON THE DANGERS WHICH LAY BEFORE YOUNG PEOPLE WITHREGARD TO THEIR SETTLEMENT IN LIFE. YOUNG MEN WERE OFTEN WILD ANDDISAPPOINTING MAKING LITTLE RETURN FOR THE MONEY SPENT ON THEM AND AGIRL WAS EXPOSED TO MANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MIGHT INTERFERE WITH HERPROSPECTS.ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE HAS GREAT ATTRACTIONS AND HER PARENTS SEE MUCHCOMPANY SAID MRS. BULSTRODE. GENTLEMEN PAY HER ATTENTION ANDENGROSS HER ALL TO THEMSELVES FOR THE MERE PLEASURE OF THE MOMENT ANDTHAT DRIVES OFF OTHERS. I THINK IT IS A HEAVY RESPONSIBILITY MR.LYDGATE TO INTERFERE WITH THE PROSPECTS OF ANY GIRL. HERE MRS.BULSTRODE FIXED HER EYES ON HIM WITH AN UNMISTAKABLE PURPOSE OFWARNING IF NOT OF REBUKE.CLEARLY SAID LYDGATE LOOKING AT HERPERHAPS EVEN STARING A LITTLEIN RETURN. ON THE OTHER HAND A MAN MUST BE A GREAT COXCOMB TO GOABOUT WITH A NOTION THAT HE MUST NOT PAY ATTENTION TO A YOUNG LADY LESTSHE SHOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM OR LEST OTHERS SHOULD THINK SHEMUST.OH MR. LYDGATE YOU KNOW WELL WHAT YOUR ADVANTAGES ARE. YOU KNOW THATOUR YOUNG MEN HERE CANNOT COPE WITH YOU. WHERE YOU FREQUENT A HOUSE ITMAY MILITATE VERY MUCH AGAINST A GIRLS MAKING A DESIRABLE SETTLEMENTIN LIFE AND PREVENT HER FROM ACCEPTING OFFERS EVEN IF THEY ARE MADE.LYDGATE WAS LESS FLATTERED BY HIS ADVANTAGE OVER THE MIDDLEMARCHORLANDOS THAN HE WAS ANNOYED BY THE PERCEPTION OF MRS. BULSTRODESMEANING. SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN AS IMPRESSIVELY AS IT WASNECESSARY TO DO AND THAT IN USING THE SUPERIOR WORD MILITATE SHE HADTHROWN A NOBLE DRAPERY OVER A MASS OF PARTICULARS WHICH WERE STILLEVIDENT ENOUGH.LYDGATE WAS FUMING A LITTLE PUSHED HIS HAIR BACK WITH ONE HAND FELTCURIOUSLY IN HIS WAISTCOATPOCKET WITH THE OTHER AND THEN STOOPED TOBECKON THE TINY BLACK SPANIEL WHICH HAD THE INSIGHT TO DECLINE HISHOLLOW CARESSES. IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DECENT TO GO AWAY BECAUSE HEHAD BEEN DINING WITH OTHER GUESTS AND HAD JUST TAKEN TEA. BUT MRS.BULSTRODE HAVING NO DOUBT THAT SHE HAD BEEN UNDERSTOOD TURNED THECONVERSATION.SOLOMONS PROVERBS I THINK HAVE OMITTED TO SAY THAT AS THE SOREPALATE FINDETH GRIT SO AN UNEASY CONSCIOUSNESS HEARETH INNUENDOES. THENEXT DAY MR. FAREBROTHER PARTING FROM LYDGATE IN THE STREET SUPPOSEDTHAT THEY SHOULD MEET AT VINCYS IN THE EVENING. LYDGATE ANSWEREDCURTLY NOHE HAD WORK TO DOHE MUST GIVE UP GOING OUT IN THE EVENING.WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET LASHED TO THE MAST EH AND ARE STOPPINGYOUR EARS SAID THE VICAR. WELL IF YOU DONT MEAN TO BE WON BY THESIRENS YOU ARE RIGHT TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS IN TIME.A FEW DAYS BEFORE LYDGATE WOULD HAVE TAKEN NO NOTICE OF THESE WORDS ASANYTHING MORE THAN THE VICARS USUAL WAY OF PUTTING THINGS. THEY SEEMEDNOW TO CONVEY AN INNUENDO WHICH CONFIRMED THE IMPRESSION THAT HE HADBEEN MAKING A FOOL OF HIMSELF AND BEHAVING SO AS TO BE MISUNDERSTOODNOT HE BELIEVED BY ROSAMOND HERSELF SHE HE FELT SURE TOOKEVERYTHING AS LIGHTLY AS HE INTENDED IT. SHE HAD AN EXQUISITE TACT ANDINSIGHT IN RELATION TO ALL POINTS OF MANNERS BUT THE PEOPLE SHE LIVEDAMONG WERE BLUNDERERS AND BUSYBODIES. HOWEVER THE MISTAKE SHOULD GO NOFARTHER. HE RESOLVEDAND KEPT HIS RESOLUTIONTHAT HE WOULD NOT GO TOMR. VINCYS EXCEPT ON BUSINESS.ROSAMOND BECAME VERY UNHAPPY. THE UNEASINESS FIRST STIRRED BY HERAUNTS QUESTIONS GREW AND GREW TILL AT THE END OF TEN DAYS THAT SHE HADNOT SEEN LYDGATE IT GREW INTO TERROR AT THE BLANK THAT MIGHT POSSIBLYCOMEINTO FOREBODING OF THAT READY FATAL SPONGE WHICH SO CHEAPLY WIPESOUT THE HOPES OF MORTALS. THE WORLD WOULD HAVE A NEW DREARINESS FORHER AS A WILDERNESS THAT A MAGICIANS SPELLS HAD TURNED FOR A LITTLEWHILE INTO A GARDEN. SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS BEGINNING TO KNOW THE PANGOF DISAPPOINTED LOVE AND THAT NO OTHER MAN COULD BE THE OCCASION OFSUCH DELIGHTFUL AERIAL BUILDING AS SHE HAD BEEN ENJOYING FOR THE LASTSIX MONTHS. POOR ROSAMOND LOST HER APPETITE AND FELT AS FORLORN ASARIADNEAS A CHARMING STAGE ARIADNE LEFT BEHIND WITH ALL HER BOXES FULLOF COSTUMES AND NO HOPE OF A COACH.THERE ARE MANY WONDERFUL MIXTURES IN THE WORLD WHICH ARE ALL ALIKECALLED LOVE AND CLAIM THE PRIVILEGES OF A SUBLIME RAGE WHICH IS ANAPOLOGY FOR EVERYTHING IN LITERATURE AND THE DRAMA. HAPPILY ROSAMONDDID NOT THINK OF COMMITTING ANY DESPERATE ACT SHE PLAITED HER FAIRHAIR AS BEAUTIFULLY AS USUAL AND KEPT HERSELF PROUDLY CALM. HER MOSTCHEERFUL SUPPOSITION WAS THAT HER AUNT BULSTRODE HAD INTERFERED IN SOMEWAY TO HINDER LYDGATES VISITS EVERYTHING WAS BETTER THAN ASPONTANEOUS INDIFFERENCE IN HIM. ANY ONE WHO IMAGINES TEN DAYS TOOSHORT A TIMENOT FOR FALLING INTO LEANNESS LIGHTNESS OR OTHERMEASURABLE EFFECTS OF PASSION BUTFOR THE WHOLE SPIRITUAL CIRCUIT OFALARMED CONJECTURE AND DISAPPOINTMENT IS IGNORANT OF WHAT CAN GO ON INTHE ELEGANT LEISURE OF A YOUNG LADYS MIND.ON THE ELEVENTH DAY HOWEVER LYDGATE WHEN LEAVING STONE COURT WASREQUESTED BY MRS. VINCY TO LET HER HUSBAND KNOW THAT THERE WAS A MARKEDCHANGE IN MR. FEATHERSTONES HEALTH AND THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO COME TOSTONE COURT ON THAT DAY. NOW LYDGATE MIGHT HAVE CALLED AT THEWAREHOUSE OR MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN A MESSAGE ON A LEAF OF HIS POCKETBOOKAND LEFT IT AT THE DOOR. YET THESE SIMPLE DEVICES APPARENTLY DID NOTOCCUR TO HIM FROM WHICH WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT HE HAD NO STRONGOBJECTION TO CALLING AT THE HOUSE AT AN HOUR WHEN MR. VINCY WAS NOT ATHOME AND LEAVING THE MESSAGE WITH MISS VINCY. A MAN MAY FROM VARIOUSMOTIVES DECLINE TO GIVE HIS COMPANY BUT PERHAPS NOT EVEN A SAGE WOULDBE GRATIFIED THAT NOBODY MISSED HIM. IT WOULD BE A GRACEFUL EASY WAYOF PIECING ON THE NEW HABITS TO THE OLD TO HAVE A FEW PLAYFUL WORDSWITH ROSAMOND ABOUT HIS RESISTANCE TO DISSIPATION AND HIS FIRM RESOLVETO TAKE LONG FASTS EVEN FROM SWEET SOUNDS. IT MUST BE CONFESSED ALSOTHAT MOMENTARY SPECULATIONS AS TO ALL THE POSSIBLE GROUNDS FOR MRS.BULSTRODES HINTS HAD MANAGED TO GET WOVEN LIKE SLIGHT CLINGING HAIRSINTO THE MORE SUBSTANTIAL WEB OF HIS THOUGHTS.MISS VINCY WAS ALONE AND BLUSHED SO DEEPLY WHEN LYDGATE CAME IN THATHE FELT A CORRESPONDING EMBARRASSMENT AND INSTEAD OF ANY PLAYFULNESSHE BEGAN AT ONCE TO SPEAK OF HIS REASON FOR CALLING AND TO BEG HERALMOST FORMALLY TO DELIVER THE MESSAGE TO HER FATHER. ROSAMOND WHO ATTHE FIRST MOMENT FELT AS IF HER HAPPINESS WERE RETURNING WAS KEENLYHURT BY LYDGATES MANNER HER BLUSH HAD DEPARTED AND SHE ASSENTEDCOLDLY WITHOUT ADDING AN UNNECESSARY WORD SOME TRIVIAL CHAINWORKWHICH SHE HAD IN HER HANDS ENABLING HER TO AVOID LOOKING AT LYDGATEHIGHER THAN HIS CHIN. IN ALL FAILURES THE BEGINNING IS CERTAINLY THEHALF OF THE WHOLE. AFTER SITTING TWO LONG MOMENTS WHILE HE MOVED HISWHIP AND COULD SAY NOTHING LYDGATE ROSE TO GO AND ROSAMOND MADENERVOUS BY HER STRUGGLE BETWEEN MORTIFICATION AND THE WISH NOT TOBETRAY IT DROPPED HER CHAIN AS IF STARTLED AND ROSE TOOMECHANICALLY. LYDGATE INSTANTANEOUSLY STOOPED TO PICK UP THE CHAIN.WHEN HE ROSE HE WAS VERY NEAR TO A LOVELY LITTLE FACE SET ON A FAIRLONG NECK WHICH HE HAD BEEN USED TO SEE TURNING ABOUT UNDER THE MOSTPERFECT MANAGEMENT OF SELFCONTENTED GRACE. BUT AS HE RAISED HIS EYESNOW HE SAW A CERTAIN HELPLESS QUIVERING WHICH TOUCHED HIM QUITE NEWLYAND MADE HIM LOOK AT ROSAMOND WITH A QUESTIONING FLASH. AT THIS MOMENTSHE WAS AS NATURAL AS SHE HAD EVER BEEN WHEN SHE WAS FIVE YEARS OLDSHE FELT THAT HER TEARS HAD RISEN AND IT WAS NO USE TO TRY TO DOANYTHING ELSE THAN LET THEM STAY LIKE WATER ON A BLUE FLOWER OR LETTHEM FALL OVER HER CHEEKS EVEN AS THEY WOULD.THAT MOMENT OF NATURALNESS WAS THE CRYSTALLIZING FEATHERTOUCH ITSHOOK FLIRTATION INTO LOVE. REMEMBER THAT THE AMBITIOUS MAN WHO WASLOOKING AT THOSE FORGETMENOTS UNDER THE WATER WAS VERY WARMHEARTEDAND RASH. HE DID NOT KNOW WHERE THE CHAIN WENT AN IDEA HAD THRILLEDTHROUGH THE RECESSES WITHIN HIM WHICH HAD A MIRACULOUS EFFECT INRAISING THE POWER OF PASSIONATE LOVE LYING BURIED THERE IN NO SEALEDSEPULCHRE BUT UNDER THE LIGHTEST EASILY PIERCED MOULD. HIS WORDS WEREQUITE ABRUPT AND AWKWARD BUT THE TONE MADE THEM SOUND LIKE AN ARDENTAPPEALING AVOWAL.WHAT IS THE MATTER YOU ARE DISTRESSED. TELL ME PRAY.ROSAMOND HAD NEVER BEEN SPOKEN TO IN SUCH TONES BEFORE. I AM NOT SURETHAT SHE KNEW WHAT THE WORDS WERE BUT SHE LOOKED AT LYDGATE AND THETEARS FELL OVER HER CHEEKS. THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NO MORE COMPLETEANSWER THAN THAT SILENCE AND LYDGATE FORGETTING EVERYTHING ELSECOMPLETELY MASTERED BY THE OUTRUSH OF TENDERNESS AT THE SUDDEN BELIEFTHAT THIS SWEET YOUNG CREATURE DEPENDED ON HIM FOR HER JOY ACTUALLYPUT HIS ARMS ROUND HER FOLDING HER GENTLY AND PROTECTINGLYHE WAS USEDTO BEING GENTLE WITH THE WEAK AND SUFFERINGAND KISSED EACH OF THE TWOLARGE TEARS. THIS WAS A STRANGE WAY OF ARRIVING AT AN UNDERSTANDINGBUT IT WAS A SHORT WAY. ROSAMOND WAS NOT ANGRY BUT SHE MOVED BACKWARDA LITTLE IN TIMID HAPPINESS AND LYDGATE COULD NOW SIT NEAR HER ANDSPEAK LESS INCOMPLETELY. ROSAMOND HAD TO MAKE HER LITTLE CONFESSIONAND HE POURED OUT WORDS OF GRATITUDE AND TENDERNESS WITH IMPULSIVELAVISHMENT. IN HALF AN HOUR HE LEFT THE HOUSE AN ENGAGED MAN WHOSESOUL WAS NOT HIS OWN BUT THE WOMANS TO WHOM HE HAD BOUND HIMSELF.HE CAME AGAIN IN THE EVENING TO SPEAK WITH MR. VINCY WHO JUSTRETURNED FROM STONE COURT WAS FEELING SURE THAT IT WOULD NOT BE LONGBEFORE HE HEARD OF MR. FEATHERSTONES DEMISE. THE FELICITOUS WORDDEMISE WHICH HAD SEASONABLY OCCURRED TO HIM HAD RAISED HIS SPIRITSEVEN ABOVE THEIR USUAL EVENING PITCH. THE RIGHT WORD IS ALWAYS A POWERAND COMMUNICATES ITS DEFINITENESS TO OUR ACTION. CONSIDERED AS ADEMISE OLD FEATHERSTONES DEATH ASSUMED A MERELY LEGAL ASPECT SO THATMR. VINCY COULD TAP HIS SNUFFBOX OVER IT AND BE JOVIAL WITHOUT EVENAN INTERMITTENT AFFECTATION OF SOLEMNITY AND MR. VINCY HATED BOTHSOLEMNITY AND AFFECTATION. WHO WAS EVER AWE STRUCK ABOUT A TESTATOR ORSANG A HYMN ON THE TITLE TO REAL PROPERTY MR. VINCY WAS INCLINED TOTAKE A JOVIAL VIEW OF ALL THINGS THAT EVENING HE EVEN OBSERVED TOLYDGATE THAT FRED HAD GOT THE FAMILY CONSTITUTION AFTER ALL AND WOULDSOON BE AS FINE A FELLOW AS EVER AGAIN AND WHEN HIS APPROBATION OFROSAMONDS ENGAGEMENT WAS ASKED FOR HE GAVE IT WITH ASTONISHINGFACILITY PASSING AT ONCE TO GENERAL REMARKS ON THE DESIRABLENESS OFMATRIMONY FOR YOUNG MEN AND MAIDENS AND APPARENTLY DEDUCING FROM THEWHOLE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF A LITTLE MORE PUNCH.CHAPTER XXXII.THEYLL TAKE SUGGESTION AS A CAT LAPS MILK.SHAKESPEARE TEMPEST.THE TRIUMPHANT CONFIDENCE OF THE MAYOR FOUNDED ON MR. FEATHERSTONESINSISTENT DEMAND THAT FRED AND HIS MOTHER SHOULD NOT LEAVE HIM WAS AFEEBLE EMOTION COMPARED WITH ALL THAT WAS AGITATING THE BREASTS OF THEOLD MANS BLOODRELATIONS WHO NATURALLY MANIFESTED MORE THEIR SENSE OFTHE FAMILY TIE AND WERE MORE VISIBLY NUMEROUS NOW THAT HE HAD BECOMEBEDRIDDEN. NATURALLY FOR WHEN POOR PETER HAD OCCUPIED HIS ARMCHAIRIN THE WAINSCOTED PARLOR NO ASSIDUOUS BEETLES FOR WHOM THE COOKPREPARES BOILING WATER COULD HAVE BEEN LESS WELCOME ON A HEARTH WHICHTHEY HAD REASONS FOR PREFERRING THAN THOSE PERSONS WHOSE FEATHERSTONEBLOOD WAS ILLNOURISHED NOT FROM PENURIOUSNESS ON THEIR PART BUT FROMPOVERTY. BROTHER SOLOMON AND SISTER JANE WERE RICH AND THE FAMILYCANDOR AND TOTAL ABSTINENCE FROM FALSE POLITENESS WITH WHICH THEY WEREALWAYS RECEIVED SEEMED TO THEM NO ARGUMENT THAT THEIR BROTHER IN THESOLEMN ACT OF MAKING HIS WILL WOULD OVERLOOK THE SUPERIOR CLAIMS OFWEALTH. THEMSELVES AT LEAST HE HAD NEVER BEEN UNNATURAL ENOUGH TOBANISH FROM HIS HOUSE AND IT SEEMED HARDLY ECCENTRIC THAT HE SHOULDHAVE KEPT AWAY BROTHER JONAH SISTER MARTHA AND THE REST WHO HAD NOSHADOW OF SUCH CLAIMS. THEY KNEW PETERS MAXIM THAT MONEY WAS A GOODEGG AND SHOULD BE LAID IN A WARM NEST.BUT BROTHER JONAH SISTER MARTHA AND ALL THE NEEDY EXILES HELD ADIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW. PROBABILITIES ARE AS VARIOUS AS THE FACES TOBE SEEN AT WILL IN FRETWORK OR PAPERHANGINGS EVERY FORM IS THEREFROM JUPITER TO JUDY IF YOU ONLY LOOK WITH CREATIVE INCLINATION. TOTHE POORER AND LEAST FAVORED IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT SINCE PETER HAD DONENOTHING FOR THEM IN HIS LIFE HE WOULD REMEMBER THEM AT THE LAST. JONAHARGUED THAT MEN LIKED TO MAKE A SURPRISE OF THEIR WILLS WHILE MARTHASAID THAT NOBODY NEED BE SURPRISED IF HE LEFT THE BEST PART OF HISMONEY TO THOSE WHO LEAST EXPECTED IT. ALSO IT WAS NOT TO BE THOUGHT BUTTHAT AN OWN BROTHER LYING THERE WITH DROPSY IN HIS LEGS MUST COME TOFEEL THAT BLOOD WAS THICKER THAN WATER AND IF HE DIDNT ALTER HISWILL HE MIGHT HAVE MONEY BY HIM. AT ANY RATE SOME BLOODRELATIONSSHOULD BE ON THE PREMISES AND ON THE WATCH AGAINST THOSE WHO WEREHARDLY RELATIONS AT ALL. SUCH THINGS HAD BEEN KNOWN AS FORGED WILLS ANDDISPUTED WILLS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE THE GOLDENHAZY ADVANTAGE OFSOMEHOW ENABLING NONLEGATEES TO LIVE OUT OF THEM. AGAIN THOSE WHOWERE NO BLOODRELATIONS MIGHT BE CAUGHT MAKING AWAY WITH THINGSANDPOOR PETER LYING THERE HELPLESS SOMEBODY SHOULD BE ON THE WATCH. BUTIN THIS CONCLUSION THEY WERE AT ONE WITH SOLOMON AND JANE ALSO SOMENEPHEWS NIECES AND COUSINS ARGUING WITH STILL GREATER SUBTILTY AS TOWHAT MIGHT BE DONE BY A MAN ABLE TO WILL AWAY HIS PROPERTY AND GIVEHIMSELF LARGE TREATS OF ODDITY FELT IN A HANDSOME SORT OF WAY THATTHERE WAS A FAMILY INTEREST TO BE ATTENDED TO AND THOUGHT OF STONECOURT AS A PLACE WHICH IT WOULD BE NOTHING BUT RIGHT FOR THEM TO VISIT.SISTER MARTHA OTHERWISE MRS. CRANCH LIVING WITH SOME WHEEZINESS INTHE CHALKY FLATS COULD NOT UNDERTAKE THE JOURNEY BUT HER SON ASBEING POOR PETERS OWN NEPHEW COULD REPRESENT HER ADVANTAGEOUSLY ANDWATCH LEST HIS UNCLE JONAH SHOULD MAKE AN UNFAIR USE OF THE IMPROBABLETHINGS WHICH SEEMED LIKELY TO HAPPEN. IN FACT THERE WAS A GENERAL SENSERUNNING IN THE FEATHERSTONE BLOOD THAT EVERYBODY MUST WATCH EVERYBODYELSE AND THAT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR EVERYBODY ELSE TO REFLECT THAT THEALMIGHTY WAS WATCHING HIM.THUS STONE COURT CONTINUALLY SAW ONE OR OTHER BLOODRELATION ALIGHTINGOR DEPARTING AND MARY GARTH HAD THE UNPLEASANT TASK OF CARRYING THEIRMESSAGES TO MR. FEATHERSTONE WHO WOULD SEE NONE OF THEM AND SENT HERDOWN WITH THE STILL MORE UNPLEASANT TASK OF TELLING THEM SO. AS MANAGEROF THE HOUSEHOLD SHE FELT BOUND TO ASK THEM IN GOOD PROVINCIAL FASHIONTO STAY AND EAT BUT SHE CHOSE TO CONSULT MRS. VINCY ON THE POINT OFEXTRA DOWNSTAIRS CONSUMPTION NOW THAT MR. FEATHERSTONE WAS LAID UP.OH MY DEAR YOU MUST DO THINGS HANDSOMELY WHERE THERES LAST ILLNESSAND A PROPERTY. GOD KNOWS I DONT GRUDGE THEM EVERY HAM IN THEHOUSEONLY SAVE THE BEST FOR THE FUNERAL. HAVE SOME STUFFED VEALALWAYS AND A FINE CHEESE IN CUT. YOU MUST EXPECT TO KEEP OPEN HOUSE INTHESE LAST ILLNESSES SAID LIBERAL MRS. VINCY ONCE MORE OF CHEERFULNOTE AND BRIGHT PLUMAGE.BUT SOME OF THE VISITORS ALIGHTED AND DID NOT DEPART AFTER THE HANDSOMETREATING TO VEAL AND HAM. BROTHER JONAH FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE SUCHUNPLEASANT PEOPLE IN MOST FAMILIES PERHAPS EVEN IN THE HIGHESTARISTOCRACY THERE ARE BROBDINGNAG SPECIMENS GIGANTICALLY IN DEBT ANDBLOATED AT GREATER EXPENSEBROTHER JONAH I SAY HAVING COME DOWN INTHE WORLD WAS MAINLY SUPPORTED BY A CALLING WHICH HE WAS MODEST ENOUGHNOT TO BOAST OF THOUGH IT WAS MUCH BETTER THAN SWINDLING EITHER ONEXCHANGE OR TURF BUT WHICH DID NOT REQUIRE HIS PRESENCE AT BRASSING SOLONG AS HE HAD A GOOD CORNER TO SIT IN AND A SUPPLY OF FOOD. HE CHOSETHE KITCHENCORNER PARTLY BECAUSE HE LIKED IT BEST AND PARTLY BECAUSEHE DID NOT WANT TO SIT WITH SOLOMON CONCERNING WHOM HE HAD A STRONGBROTHERLY OPINION. SEATED IN A FAMOUS ARMCHAIR AND IN HIS BEST SUITCONSTANTLY WITHIN SIGHT OF GOOD CHEER HE HAD A COMFORTABLECONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING ON THE PREMISES MINGLED WITH FLEETINGSUGGESTIONS OF SUNDAY AND THE BAR AT THE GREEN MAN AND HE INFORMEDMARY GARTH THAT HE SHOULD NOT GO OUT OF REACH OF HIS BROTHER PETERWHILE THAT POOR FELLOW WAS ABOVE GROUND. THE TROUBLESOME ONES IN AFAMILY ARE USUALLY EITHER THE WITS OR THE IDIOTS. JONAH WAS THE WITAMONG THE FEATHERSTONES AND JOKED WITH THE MAIDSERVANTS WHEN THEYCAME ABOUT THE HEARTH BUT SEEMED TO CONSIDER MISS GARTH A SUSPICIOUSCHARACTER AND FOLLOWED HER WITH COLD EYES.MARY WOULD HAVE BORNE THIS ONE PAIR OF EYES WITH COMPARATIVE EASE BUTUNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS YOUNG CRANCH WHO HAVING COME ALL THE WAY FROMTHE CHALKY FLATS TO REPRESENT HIS MOTHER AND WATCH HIS UNCLE JONAHALSO FELT IT HIS DUTY TO STAY AND TO SIT CHIEFLY IN THE KITCHEN TO GIVEHIS UNCLE COMPANY. YOUNG CRANCH WAS NOT EXACTLY THE BALANCING POINTBETWEEN THE WIT AND THE IDIOTVERGING SLIGHTLY TOWARDS THE LATTERTYPE AND SQUINTING SO AS TO LEAVE EVERYTHING IN DOUBT ABOUT HISSENTIMENTS EXCEPT THAT THEY WERE NOT OF A FORCIBLE CHARACTER. WHEN MARYGARTH ENTERED THE KITCHEN AND MR. JONAH FEATHERSTONE BEGAN TO FOLLOWHER WITH HIS COLD DETECTIVE EYES YOUNG CRANCH TURNING HIS HEAD IN THESAME DIRECTION SEEMED TO INSIST ON IT THAT SHE SHOULD REMARK HOW HE WASSQUINTING AS IF HE DID IT WITH DESIGN LIKE THE GYPSIES WHEN BORROWREAD THE NEW TESTAMENT TO THEM. THIS WAS RATHER TOO MUCH FOR POOR MARYSOMETIMES IT MADE HER BILIOUS SOMETIMES IT UPSET HER GRAVITY. ONE DAYTHAT SHE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY SHE COULD NOT RESIST DESCRIBING THE KITCHENSCENE TO FRED WHO WOULD NOT BE HINDERED FROM IMMEDIATELY GOING TO SEEIT AFFECTING SIMPLY TO PASS THROUGH. BUT NO SOONER DID HE FACE THEFOUR EYES THAN HE HAD TO RUSH THROUGH THE NEAREST DOOR WHICH HAPPENEDTO LEAD TO THE DAIRY AND THERE UNDER THE HIGH ROOF AND AMONG THE PANSHE GAVE WAY TO LAUGHTER WHICH MADE A HOLLOW RESONANCE PERFECTLY AUDIBLEIN THE KITCHEN. HE FLED BY ANOTHER DOORWAY BUT MR.

TOM LOOKED AT HIS LEGS BUT LEFT ITUNCERTAIN WHETHER HE PREFERRED HIS MORAL ADVANTAGES TO A MORE VICIOUSLENGTH OF LIMB AND REPREHENSIBLE GENTILITY OF TROUSER.IN THE LARGE WAINSCOTED PARLOR TOO THERE WERE CONSTANTLY PAIRS OF EYESON THE WATCH AND OWN RELATIVES EAGER TO BE SITTERSUP. MANY CAMELUNCHED AND DEPARTED BUT BROTHER SOLOMON AND THE LADY WHO HAD BEENJANE FEATHERSTONE FOR TWENTYFIVE YEARS BEFORE SHE WAS MRS. WAULE FOUNDIT GOOD TO BE THERE EVERY DAY FOR HOURS WITHOUT OTHER CALCULABLEOCCUPATION THAN THAT OF OBSERVING THE CUNNING MARY GARTH WHO WAS SODEEP THAT SHE COULD BE FOUND OUT IN NOTHING AND GIVING OCCASIONAL DRYWRINKLY INDICATIONS OF CRYINGAS IF CAPABLE OF TORRENTS IN A WETTERSEASONAT THE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO INTO MR.FEATHERSTONES ROOM. FOR THE OLD MANS DISLIKE OF HIS OWN FAMILY SEEMEDTO GET STRONGER AS HE GOT LESS ABLE TO AMUSE HIMSELF BY SAYING BITINGTHINGS TO THEM. TOO LANGUID TO STING HE HAD THE MORE VENOM REFLUENT INHIS BLOOD.NOT FULLY BELIEVING THE MESSAGE SENT THROUGH MARY GARTH THEY HADPRESENTED THEMSELVES TOGETHER WITHIN THE DOOR OF THE BEDROOM BOTH INBLACKMRS. WAULE HAVING A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF PARTIALLY UNFOLDED IN HERHANDAND BOTH WITH FACES IN A SORT OF HALFMOURNING PURPLE WHILE MRS.VINCY WITH HER PINK CHEEKS AND PINK RIBBONS FLYING WAS ACTUALLYADMINISTERING A CORDIAL TO THEIR OWN BROTHER AND THELIGHTCOMPLEXIONED FRED HIS SHORT HAIR CURLING AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED INA GAMBLERS WAS LOLLING AT HIS EASE IN A LARGE CHAIR.OLD FEATHERSTONE NO SOONER CAUGHT SIGHT OF THESE FUNEREAL FIGURESAPPEARING IN SPITE OF HIS ORDERS THAN RAGE CAME TO STRENGTHEN HIM MORESUCCESSFULLY THAN THE CORDIAL. HE WAS PROPPED UP ON A BEDREST ANDALWAYS HAD HIS GOLDHEADED STICK LYING BY HIM.

PETER MRS. WAULE BEGANBUT SOLOMON PUT HIS HAND BEFOREHER REPRESSINGLY. HE WAS A LARGECHEEKED MAN NEARLY SEVENTY WITHSMALL FURTIVE EYES AND WAS NOT ONLY OF MUCH BLANDER TEMPER BUT THOUGHTHIMSELF MUCH DEEPER THAN HIS BROTHER PETER INDEED NOT LIKELY TO BEDECEIVED IN ANY OF HIS FELLOWMEN INASMUCH AS THEY COULD NOT WELL BEMORE GREEDY AND DECEITFUL THAN HE SUSPECTED THEM OF BEING. EVEN THEINVISIBLE POWERS HE THOUGHT WERE LIKELY TO BE SOOTHED BY A BLANDPARENTHESIS HERE AND THERECOMING FROM A MAN OF PROPERTY WHO MIGHTHAVE BEEN AS IMPIOUS AS OTHERS.BROTHER PETER HE SAID IN A WHEEDLING YET GRAVELY OFFICIAL TONEITS NOTHING BUT RIGHT I SHOULD SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THE THREE CROFTSAND THE MANGANESE. THE ALMIGHTY KNOWS WHAT IVE GOT ON MY MINDTHEN HE KNOWS MORE THAN I WANT TO KNOW SAID PETER LAYING DOWN HISSTICK WITH A SHOW OF TRUCE WHICH HAD A THREAT IN IT TOO FOR HEREVERSED THE STICK SO AS TO MAKE THE GOLD HANDLE A CLUB IN CASE OFCLOSER FIGHTING AND LOOKED HARD AT SOLOMONS BALD HEAD.THERES THINGS YOU MIGHT REPENT OF BROTHER FOR WANT OF SPEAKING TOME SAID SOLOMON NOT ADVANCING HOWEVER. I COULD SIT UP WITH YOUTONIGHT AND JANE WITH ME WILLINGLY AND YOU MIGHT TAKE YOUR OWN TIMETO SPEAK OR LET ME SPEAK.YES I SHALL TAKE MY OWN TIMEYOU NEEDNT OFFER ME YOURS SAID PETER.BUT YOU CANT TAKE YOUR OWN TIME TO DIE IN BROTHER BEGAN MRS.WAULE WITH HER USUAL WOOLLY TONE. AND WHEN YOU LIE SPEECHLESS YOU MAYBE TIRED OF HAVING STRANGERS ABOUT YOU AND YOU MAY THINK OF ME AND MYCHILDRENBUT HERE HER VOICE BROKE UNDER THE TOUCHING THOUGHT WHICH SHEWAS ATTRIBUTING TO HER SPEECHLESS BROTHER THE MENTION OF OURSELVESBEING NATURALLY AFFECTING.NO I SHANT SAID OLD FEATHERSTONE CONTRADICTIOUSLY. I SHANTTHINK OF ANY OF YOU. IVE MADE MY WILL I TELL YOU IVE MADE MY WILL.HERE HE TURNED HIS HEAD TOWARDS MRS.

STOP WHEREYOU ARE. GOODBY SOLOMON HE ADDED TRYING TO WIELD HIS STICK AGAINBUT FAILING NOW THAT HE HAD REVERSED THE HANDLE. GOODBY MRS. WAULE.DONT YOU COME AGAIN.I SHALL BE DOWNSTAIRS BROTHER WHETHER OR NO SAID SOLOMON. ISHALL DO MY DUTY AND IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHAT THE ALMIGHTY WILLALLOW.YES IN PROPERTY GOING OUT OF FAMILIES SAID MRS. WAULE INCONTINUATIONAND WHERE THERES STEADY YOUNG MEN TO CARRY ON. BUT IPITY THEM WHO ARE NOT SUCH AND I PITY THEIR MOTHERS. GOODBY BROTHERPETER.REMEMBER IM THE ELDEST AFTER YOU BROTHER AND PROSPERED FROM THEFIRST JUST AS YOU DID AND HAVE GOT LAND ALREADY BY THE NAME OFFEATHERSTONE SAID SOLOMON RELYING MUCH ON THAT REFLECTION AS ONEWHICH MIGHT BE SUGGESTED IN THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT. BUT I BID YOUGOODBY FOR THE PRESENT.THEIR EXIT WAS HASTENED BY THEIR SEEING OLD MR. FEATHERSTONE PULL HISWIG ON EACH SIDE AND SHUT HIS EYES WITH HIS MOUTHWIDENING GRIMACE ASIF HE WERE DETERMINED TO BE DEAF AND BLIND.NONE THE LESS THEY CAME TO STONE COURT DAILY AND SAT BELOW AT THE POSTOF DUTY SOMETIMES CARRYING ON A SLOW DIALOGUE IN AN UNDERTONE IN WHICHTHE OBSERVATION AND RESPONSE WERE SO FAR APART THAT ANY ONE HEARINGTHEM MIGHT HAVE IMAGINED HIMSELF LISTENING TO SPEAKING AUTOMATA INSOME DOUBT WHETHER THE INGENIOUS MECHANISM WOULD REALLY WORK OR WINDITSELF UP FOR A LONG TIME IN ORDER TO STICK AND BE SILENT. SOLOMON ANDJANE WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY TO BE QUICK WHAT THAT LED TO MIGHT BE SEENON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL IN THE PERSON OF BROTHER JONAH.BUT THEIR WATCH IN THE WAINSCOTED PARLOR WAS SOMETIMES VARIED BY THEPRESENCE OF OTHER GUESTS FROM FAR OR NEAR. NOW THAT PETER FEATHERSTONEWAS UPSTAIRS HIS PROPERTY COULD BE DISCUSSED WITH ALL THAT LOCALENLIGHTENMENT TO BE FOUND ON THE SPOT SOME RURAL AND MIDDLEMARCHNEIGHBORS EXPRESSED MUCH AGREEMENT WITH THE FAMILY AND SYMPATHY WITHTHEIR INTEREST AGAINST THE VINCYS AND FEMININE VISITORS WERE EVENMOVED TO TEARS IN CONVERSATION WITH MRS. WAULE WHEN THEY RECALLED THEFACT THAT THEY THEMSELVES HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN TIMES PAST BYCODICILS AND MARRIAGES FOR SPITE ON THE PART OF UNGRATEFUL ELDERLYGENTLEMEN WHO IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED HAD BEEN SPARED FORSOMETHING BETTER. SUCH CONVERSATION PAUSED SUDDENLY LIKE AN ORGAN WHENTHE BELLOWS ARE LET DROP IF MARY GARTH CAME INTO THE ROOM AND ALLEYES WERE TURNED ON HER AS A POSSIBLE LEGATEE OR ONE WHO MIGHT GETACCESS TO IRON CHESTS.BUT THE YOUNGER MEN WHO WERE RELATIVES OR CONNECTIONS OF THE FAMILYWERE DISPOSED TO ADMIRE HER IN THIS PROBLEMATIC LIGHT AS A GIRL WHOSHOWED MUCH CONDUCT AND WHO AMONG ALL THE CHANCES THAT WERE FLYINGMIGHT TURN OUT TO BE AT LEAST A MODERATE PRIZE. HENCE SHE HAD HER SHAREOF COMPLIMENTS AND POLITE ATTENTIONS.ESPECIALLY FROM MR. BORTHROP TRUMBULL A DISTINGUISHED BACHELOR ANDAUCTIONEER OF THOSE PARTS MUCH CONCERNED IN THE SALE OF LAND ANDCATTLE A PUBLIC CHARACTER INDEED WHOSE NAME WAS SEEN ON WIDELYDISTRIBUTED PLACARDS AND WHO MIGHT REASONABLY BE SORRY FOR THOSE WHODID NOT KNOW OF HIM. HE WAS SECOND COUSIN TO PETER FEATHERSTONE ANDHAD BEEN TREATED BY HIM WITH MORE AMENITY THAN ANY OTHER RELATIVEBEING USEFUL IN MATTERS OF BUSINESS AND IN THAT PROGRAMME OF HISFUNERAL WHICH THE OLD MAN HAD HIMSELF DICTATED HE HAD BEEN NAMED AS ABEARER. THERE WAS NO ODIOUS CUPIDITY IN MR. BORTHROP TRUMBULLNOTHINGMORE THAN A SINCERE SENSE OF HIS OWN MERIT WHICH HE WAS AWARE INCASE OF RIVALRY MIGHT TELL AGAINST COMPETITORS SO THAT IF PETERFEATHERSTONE WHO SO FAR AS HE TRUMBULL WAS CONCERNED HAD BEHAVEDLIKE AS GOOD A SOUL AS EVER BREATHED SHOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHINGHANDSOME BY HIM ALL HE COULD SAY WAS THAT HE HAD NEVER FISHED ANDFAWNED BUT HAD ADVISED HIM TO THE BEST OF HIS EXPERIENCE WHICH NOWEXTENDED OVER TWENTY YEARS FROM THE TIME OF HIS APPRENTICESHIP ATFIFTEEN AND WAS LIKELY TO YIELD A KNOWLEDGE OF NO SURREPTITIOUS KIND.HIS ADMIRATION WAS FAR FROM BEING CONFINED TO HIMSELF BUT WASACCUSTOMED PROFESSIONALLY AS WELL AS PRIVATELY TO DELIGHT IN ESTIMATINGTHINGS AT A HIGH RATE. HE WAS AN AMATEUR OF SUPERIOR PHRASES AND NEVERUSED POOR LANGUAGE WITHOUT IMMEDIATELY CORRECTING HIMSELFWHICH WASFORTUNATE AS HE WAS RATHER LOUD AND GIVEN TO PREDOMINATE STANDING ORWALKING ABOUT FREQUENTLY PULLING DOWN HIS WAISTCOAT WITH THE AIR OF AMAN WHO IS VERY MUCH OF HIS OWN OPINION TRIMMING HIMSELF RAPIDLY WITHHIS FOREFINGER AND MARKING EACH NEW SERIES IN THESE MOVEMENTS BY ABUSY PLAY WITH HIS LARGE SEALS. THERE WAS OCCASIONALLY A LITTLEFIERCENESS IN HIS DEMEANOR BUT IT WAS DIRECTED CHIEFLY AGAINST FALSEOPINION OF WHICH THERE IS SO MUCH TO CORRECT IN THE WORLD THAT A MANOF SOME READING AND EXPERIENCE NECESSARILY HAS HIS PATIENCE TRIED. HEFELT THAT THE FEATHERSTONE FAMILY GENERALLY WAS OF LIMITEDUNDERSTANDING BUT BEING A MAN OF THE WORLD AND A PUBLIC CHARACTERTOOK EVERYTHING AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND EVEN WENT TO CONVERSE WITHMR. JONAH AND YOUNG CRANCH IN THE KITCHEN NOT DOUBTING THAT HE HADIMPRESSED THE LATTER GREATLY BY HIS LEADING QUESTIONS CONCERNING THECHALKY FLATS. IF ANYBODY HAD OBSERVED THAT MR. BORTHROP TRUMBULL BEINGAN AUCTIONEER WAS BOUND TO KNOW THE NATURE OF EVERYTHING HE WOULDHAVE SMILED AND TRIMMED HIMSELF SILENTLY WITH THE SENSE THAT HE CAMEPRETTY NEAR THAT. ON THE WHOLE IN AN AUCTIONEERING WAY HE WAS ANHONORABLE MAN NOT ASHAMED OF HIS BUSINESS AND FEELING THAT THECELEBRATED PEEL NOW SIR ROBERT IF INTRODUCED TO HIM WOULD NOT FAILTO RECOGNIZE HIS IMPORTANCE.I DONT MIND IF I HAVE A SLICE OF THAT HAM AND A GLASS OF THAT ALEMISS GARTH IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME HE SAID COMING INTO THE PARLOR ATHALFPAST ELEVEN AFTER HAVING HAD THE EXCEPTIONAL PRIVILEGE OF SEEINGOLD FEATHERSTONE AND STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE BETWEEN MRS.WAULE AND SOLOMON.ITS NOT NECESSARY FOR YOU TO GO OUTLET ME RING THE BELL.THANK YOU SAID MARY I HAVE AN ERRAND.WELL MR. TRUMBULL YOURE HIGHLY FAVORED SAID MRS. WAULE.WHAT SEEING THE OLD MAN SAID THE AUCTIONEER PLAYING WITH HIS SEALSDISPASSIONATELY. AH YOU SEE HE HAS RELIED ON ME CONSIDERABLY. HEREHE PRESSED HIS LIPS TOGETHER AND FROWNED MEDITATIVELY.MIGHT ANYBODY ASK WHAT THEIR BROTHER HAS BEEN SAYING SAID SOLOMONIN A SOFT TONE OF HUMILITY IN WHICH HE HAD A SENSE OF LUXURIOUSCUNNING HE BEING A RICH MAN AND NOT IN NEED OF IT.OH YES ANYBODY MAY ASK SAID MR. TRUMBULL WITH LOUD ANDGOODHUMORED THOUGH CUTTING SARCASM. ANYBODY MAY INTERROGATE. ANY ONEMAY GIVE THEIR REMARKS AN INTERROGATIVE TURN HE CONTINUED HISSONOROUSNESS RISING WITH HIS STYLE. THIS IS CONSTANTLY DONE BY GOODSPEAKERS EVEN WHEN THEY ANTICIPATE NO ANSWER. IT IS WHAT WE CALL AFIGURE OF SPEECHSPEECH AT A HIGH FIGURE AS ONE MAY SAY. THE ELOQUENTAUCTIONEER SMILED AT HIS OWN INGENUITY.I SHOULDNT BE SORRY TO HEAR HED REMEMBERED YOU MR. TRUMBULL SAIDSOLOMON. I NEVER WAS AGAINST THE DESERVING. ITS THE UNDESERVING IMAGAINST.AH THERE IT IS YOU SEE THERE IT IS SAID MR. TRUMBULLSIGNIFICANTLY. IT CANT BE DENIED THAT UNDESERVING PEOPLE HAVE BEENLEGATEES AND EVEN RESIDUARY LEGATEES. IT IS SO WITH TESTAMENTARYDISPOSITIONS. AGAIN HE PURSED UP HIS LIPS AND FROWNED A LITTLE.DO YOU MEAN TO SAY FOR CERTAIN MR. TRUMBULL THAT MY BROTHER HAS LEFTHIS LAND AWAY FROM OUR FAMILY SAID MRS. WAULE ON WHOM AS ANUNHOPEFUL WOMAN THOSE LONG WORDS HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT.A MAN MIGHT AS WELL TURN HIS LAND INTO CHARITY LAND AT ONCE AS LEAVEIT TO SOME PEOPLE OBSERVED SOLOMON HIS SISTERS QUESTION HAVINGDRAWN NO ANSWER.WHAT BLUECOAT LAND SAID MRS. WAULE AGAIN. OH MR. TRUMBULL YOUNEVER CAN MEAN TO SAY THAT. IT WOULD BE FLYING IN THE FACE OF THEALMIGHTY THATS PROSPERED HIM.WHILE MRS. WAULE WAS SPEAKING MR. BORTHROP TRUMBULL WALKED AWAY FROMTHE FIREPLACE TOWARDS THE WINDOW PATROLLING WITH HIS FOREFINGER ROUNDTHE INSIDE OF HIS STOCK THEN ALONG HIS WHISKERS AND THE CURVES OF HISHAIR. HE NOW WALKED TO MISS GARTHS WORKTABLE OPENED A BOOK WHICH LAYTHERE AND READ THE TITLE ALOUD WITH POMPOUS EMPHASIS AS IF HE WEREOFFERING IT FOR SALEANNE OF GEIERSTEIN PRONOUNCED JEERSTEEN OR THE MAIDEN OF THEMIST BY THE AUTHOR OF WAVERLEY. THEN TURNING THE PAGE HE BEGANSONOROUSLYTHE COURSE OF FOUR CENTURIES HAS WELLNIGH ELAPSED SINCETHE SERIES OF EVENTS WHICH ARE RELATED IN THE FOLLOWING CHAPTERS TOOKPLACE ON THE CONTINENT. HE PRONOUNCED THE LAST TRULY ADMIRABLE WORDWITH THE ACCENT ON THE LAST SYLLABLE NOT AS UNAWARE OF VULGAR USAGEBUT FEELING THAT THIS NOVEL DELIVERY ENHANCED THE SONOROUS BEAUTY WHICHHIS READING HAD GIVEN TO THE WHOLE.AND NOW THE SERVANT CAME IN WITH THE TRAY SO THAT THE MOMENTS FORANSWERING MRS. WAULES QUESTION HAD GONE BY SAFELY WHILE SHE ANDSOLOMON WATCHING MR. TRUMBULLS MOVEMENTS WERE THINKING THAT HIGHLEARNING INTERFERED SADLY WITH SERIOUS AFFAIRS. MR. BORTHROP TRUMBULLREALLY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT OLD FEATHERSTONES WILL BUT HE COULD HARDLYHAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO DECLARE ANY IGNORANCE UNLESS HE HAD BEEN ARRESTEDFOR MISPRISION OF TREASON.I SHALL TAKE A MERE MOUTHFUL OF HAM AND A GLASS OF ALE HE SAIDREASSURINGLY. AS A MAN WITH PUBLIC BUSINESS I TAKE A SNACK WHEN ICAN. I WILL BACK THIS HAM HE ADDED AFTER SWALLOWING SOME MORSELSWITH ALARMING HASTE AGAINST ANY HAM IN THE THREE KINGDOMS. IN MYOPINION IT IS BETTER THAN THE HAMS AT FRESHITT HALLAND I THINK I AM ATOLERABLE JUDGE.SOME DONT LIKE SO MUCH SUGAR IN THEIR HAMS SAID MRS. WAULE. BUT MYPOOR BROTHER WOULD ALWAYS HAVE SUGAR.IF ANY PERSON DEMANDS BETTER HE IS AT LIBERTY TO DO SO BUT GODBLESS ME WHAT AN AROMA I SHOULD BE GLAD TO BUY IN THAT QUALITY IKNOW.

HENRY VI.THAT NIGHT AFTER TWELVE OCLOCK MARY GARTH RELIEVED THE WATCH IN MR.FEATHERSTONES ROOM AND SAT THERE ALONE THROUGH THE SMALL HOURS. SHEOFTEN CHOSE THIS TASK IN WHICH SHE FOUND SOME PLEASURENOTWITHSTANDING THE OLD MANS TESTINESS WHENEVER HE DEMANDED HERATTENTIONS. THERE WERE INTERVALS IN WHICH SHE COULD SIT PERFECTLYSTILL ENJOYING THE OUTER STILLNESS AND THE SUBDUED LIGHT. THE RED FIREWITH ITS GENTLY AUDIBLE MOVEMENT SEEMED LIKE A SOLEMN EXISTENCE CALMLYINDEPENDENT OF THE PETTY PASSIONS THE IMBECILE DESIRES THE STRAININGAFTER WORTHLESS UNCERTAINTIES WHICH WERE DAILY MOVING HER CONTEMPT.MARY WAS FOND OF HER OWN THOUGHTS AND COULD AMUSE HERSELF WELL SITTINGIN TWILIGHT WITH HER HANDS IN HER LAP FOR HAVING EARLY HAD STRONGREASON TO BELIEVE THAT THINGS WERE NOT LIKELY TO BE ARRANGED FOR HERPECULIAR SATISFACTION SHE WASTED NO TIME IN ASTONISHMENT AND ANNOYANCEAT THAT FACT. AND SHE HAD ALREADY COME TO TAKE LIFE VERY MUCH AS ACOMEDY IN WHICH SHE HAD A PROUD NAY A GENEROUS RESOLUTION NOT TO ACTTHE MEAN OR TREACHEROUS PART.

YET THERE WERE SOME ILLUSIONS UNDER MARYS EYES WHICHWERE NOT QUITE COMIC TO HER. SHE WAS SECRETLY CONVINCED THOUGH SHE HADNO OTHER GROUNDS THAN HER CLOSE OBSERVATION OF OLD FEATHERSTONESNATURE THAT IN SPITE OF HIS FONDNESS FOR HAVING THE VINCYS ABOUT HIMTHEY WERE AS LIKELY TO BE DISAPPOINTED AS ANY OF THE RELATIONS WHOM HEKEPT AT A DISTANCE. SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF DISDAIN FOR MRS. VINCYSEVIDENT ALARM LEST SHE AND FRED SHOULD BE ALONE TOGETHER BUT IT DIDNOT HINDER HER FROM THINKING ANXIOUSLY OF THE WAY IN WHICH FRED WOULDBE AFFECTED IF IT SHOULD TURN OUT THAT HIS UNCLE HAD LEFT HIM AS POORAS EVER. SHE COULD MAKE A BUTT OF FRED WHEN HE WAS PRESENT BUT SHE DIDNOT ENJOY HIS FOLLIES WHEN HE WAS ABSENT.YET SHE LIKED HER THOUGHTS A VIGOROUS YOUNG MIND NOT OVERBALANCED BYPASSION FINDS A GOOD IN MAKING ACQUAINTANCE WITH LIFE AND WATCHES ITSOWN POWERS WITH INTEREST. MARY HAD PLENTY OF MERRIMENT WITHIN.HER THOUGHT WAS NOT VEINED BY ANY SOLEMNITY OR PATHOS ABOUT THE OLD MANON THE BED SUCH SENTIMENTS ARE EASIER TO AFFECT THAN TO FEEL ABOUT ANAGED CREATURE WHOSE LIFE IS NOT VISIBLY ANYTHING BUT A REMNANT OFVICES. SHE HAD ALWAYS SEEN THE MOST DISAGREEABLE SIDE OF MR.FEATHERSTONE HE WAS NOT PROUD OF HER AND SHE WAS ONLY USEFUL TO HIM.TO BE ANXIOUS ABOUT A SOUL THAT IS ALWAYS SNAPPING AT YOU MUST BE LEFTTO THE SAINTS OF THE EARTH AND MARY WAS NOT ONE OF THEM. SHE HAD NEVERRETURNED HIM A HARSH WORD AND HAD WAITED ON HIM FAITHFULLY THAT WASHER UTMOST. OLD FEATHERSTONE HIMSELF WAS NOT IN THE LEAST ANXIOUS ABOUTHIS SOUL AND HAD DECLINED TO SEE MR.

SHE NEVER FORGOTTHAT VISION OF A MAN WANTING TO DO AS HE LIKED AT THE LAST. BUT THE WAYIN WHICH HE HAD PUT THE OFFER OF THE MONEY URGED HER TO SPEAK WITHHARDER RESOLUTION THAN EVER.IT IS OF NO USE SIR. I WILL NOT DO IT. PUT UP YOUR MONEY. I WILL NOTTOUCH YOUR MONEY.

SHE SAW HIMDROPPING HIS KEYS AND TRYING TO GRASP HIS STICK WHILE HE LOOKED AT HERLIKE AN AGED HYENA THE MUSCLES OF HIS FACE GETTING DISTORTED WITH THEEFFORT OF HIS HAND. SHE PAUSED AT A SAFE DISTANCE.LET ME GIVE YOU SOME CORDIAL SHE SAID QUIETLY AND TRY TO COMPOSEYOURSELF. YOU WILL PERHAPS GO TO SLEEP. AND TOMORROW BY DAYLIGHT YOUCAN DO AS YOU LIKE.HE LIFTED THE STICK IN SPITE OF HER BEING BEYOND HIS REACH AND THREWIT WITH A HARD EFFORT WHICH WAS BUT IMPOTENCE. IT FELL SLIPPING OVERTHE FOOT OF THE BED. MARY LET IT LIE AND RETREATED TO HER CHAIR BY THEFIRE. BYANDBY SHE WOULD GO TO HIM WITH THE CORDIAL. FATIGUE WOULDMAKE HIM PASSIVE.

FEATHERSTONE MIGHT NOW FALL ASLEEP. IF SHE WENTNEAR HIM THE IRRITATION MIGHT BE KEPT UP. HE HAD SAID NOTHING AFTERTHROWING THE STICK BUT SHE HAD SEEN HIM TAKING HIS KEYS AGAIN ANDLAYING HIS RIGHT HAND ON THE MONEY. HE DID NOT PUT IT UP HOWEVER ANDSHE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS DROPPING OFF TO SLEEP.BUT MARY HERSELF BEGAN TO BE MORE AGITATED BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHATSHE HAD GONE THROUGH THAN SHE HAD BEEN BY THE REALITYQUESTIONINGTHOSE ACTS OF HERS WHICH HAD COME IMPERATIVELY AND EXCLUDED ALLQUESTION IN THE CRITICAL MOMENT.PRESENTLY THE DRY WOOD SENT OUT A FLAME WHICH ILLUMINATED EVERYCREVICE AND MARY SAW THAT THE OLD MAN WAS LYING QUIETLY WITH HIS HEADTURNED A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE. SHE WENT TOWARDS HIM WITH INAUDIBLE STEPSAND THOUGHT THAT HIS FACE LOOKED STRANGELY MOTIONLESS BUT THE NEXTMOMENT THE MOVEMENT OF THE FLAME COMMUNICATING ITSELF TO ALL OBJECTSMADE HER UNCERTAIN. THE VIOLENT BEATING OF HER HEART RENDERED HERPERCEPTIONS SO DOUBTFUL THAT EVEN WHEN SHE TOUCHED HIM AND LISTENED FORHIS BREATHING SHE COULD NOT TRUST HER CONCLUSIONS. SHE WENT TO THEWINDOW AND GENTLY PROPPED ASIDE THE CURTAIN AND BLIND SO THAT THESTILL LIGHT OF THE SKY FELL ON THE BED.THE NEXT MOMENT SHE RAN TO THE BELL AND RANG IT ENERGETICALLY.

SWIFTLY MOVING CLOUDS ONLY NOW AND THEN ALLOWED A GLEAM TOLIGHT UP ANY OBJECT WHETHER UGLY OR BEAUTIFUL THAT HAPPENED TO STANDWITHIN ITS GOLDEN SHOWER. IN THE CHURCHYARD THE OBJECTS WERE REMARKABLYVARIOUS FOR THERE WAS A LITTLE COUNTRY CROWD WAITING TO SEE THEFUNERAL. THE NEWS HAD SPREAD THAT IT WAS TO BE A BIG BURYING THE OLDGENTLEMAN HAD LEFT WRITTEN DIRECTIONS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND MEANT TOHAVE A FUNERAL BEYOND HIS BETTERS. THIS WAS TRUE FOR OLDFEATHERSTONE HAD NOT BEEN A HARPAGON WHOSE PASSIONS HAD ALL BEENDEVOURED BY THE EVERLEAN AND EVERHUNGRY PASSION OF SAVING AND WHOWOULD DRIVE A BARGAIN WITH HIS UNDERTAKER BEFOREHAND. HE LOVED MONEYBUT HE ALSO LOVED TO SPEND IT IN GRATIFYING HIS PECULIAR TASTES ANDPERHAPS HE LOVED IT BEST OF ALL AS A MEANS OF MAKING OTHERS FEEL HISPOWER MORE OR LESS UNCOMFORTABLY. IF ANY ONE WILL HERE CONTEND THATTHERE MUST HAVE BEEN TRAITS OF GOODNESS IN OLD FEATHERSTONE I WILL NOTPRESUME TO DENY THIS BUT I MUST OBSERVE THAT GOODNESS IS OF A MODESTNATURE EASILY DISCOURAGED AND WHEN MUCH PRIVACY ELBOWED IN EARLYLIFE BY UNABASHED VICES IS APT TO RETIRE INTO EXTREME PRIVACY SO THATIT IS MORE EASILY BELIEVED IN BY THOSE WHO CONSTRUCT A SELFISH OLDGENTLEMAN THEORETICALLY THAN BY THOSE WHO FORM THE NARROWER JUDGMENTSBASED ON HIS PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE. IN ANY CASE HE HAD BEEN BENT ONHAVING A HANDSOME FUNERAL AND ON HAVING PERSONS BID TO IT WHO WOULDRATHER HAVE STAYED AT HOME. HE HAD EVEN DESIRED THAT FEMALE RELATIVESSHOULD FOLLOW HIM TO THE GRAVE AND POOR SISTER MARTHA HAD TAKEN ADIFFICULT JOURNEY FOR THIS PURPOSE FROM THE CHALKY FLATS. SHE AND JANEWOULD HAVE BEEN ALTOGETHER CHEERED IN A TEARFUL MANNER BY THIS SIGNTHAT A BROTHER WHO DISLIKED SEEING THEM WHILE HE WAS LIVING HAD BEENPROSPECTIVELY FOND OF THEIR PRESENCE WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BECOME ATESTATOR IF THE SIGN HAD NOT BEEN MADE EQUIVOCAL BY BEING EXTENDED TOMRS. VINCY WHOSE EXPENSE IN HANDSOME CRAPE SEEMED TO IMPLY THE MOSTPRESUMPTUOUS HOPES AGGRAVATED BY A BLOOM OF COMPLEXION WHICH TOLDPRETTY PLAINLY THAT SHE WAS NOT A BLOODRELATION BUT OF THAT GENERALLYOBJECTIONABLE CLASS CALLED WIFES KIN.WE ARE ALL OF US IMAGINATIVE IN SOME FORM OR OTHER FOR IMAGES ARE THEBROOD OF DESIRE AND POOR OLD FEATHERSTONE WHO LAUGHED MUCH AT THE WAYIN WHICH OTHERS CAJOLED THEMSELVES DID NOT ESCAPE THE FELLOWSHIP OFILLUSION. IN WRITING THE PROGRAMME FOR HIS BURIAL HE CERTAINLY DID NOTMAKE CLEAR TO HIMSELF THAT HIS PLEASURE IN THE LITTLE DRAMA OF WHICH ITFORMED A PART WAS CONFINED TO ANTICIPATION. IN CHUCKLING OVER THEVEXATIONS HE COULD INFLICT BY THE RIGID CLUTCH OF HIS DEAD HAND HEINEVITABLY MINGLED HIS CONSCIOUSNESS WITH THAT LIVID STAGNANT PRESENCEAND SO FAR AS HE WAS PREOCCUPIED WITH A FUTURE LIFE IT WAS WITH ONE OFGRATIFICATION INSIDE HIS COFFIN. THUS OLD FEATHERSTONE WAS IMAGINATIVEAFTER HIS FASHION.HOWEVER THE THREE MOURNINGCOACHES WERE FILLED ACCORDING TO THEWRITTEN ORDERS OF THE DECEASED. THERE WERE PALLBEARERS ON HORSEBACKWITH THE RICHEST SCARFS AND HATBANDS AND EVEN THE UNDERBEARERS HADTRAPPINGS OF WOE WHICH WERE OF A GOOD WELLPRICED QUALITY. THE BLACKPROCESSION WHEN DISMOUNTED LOOKED THE LARGER FOR THE SMALLNESS OF THECHURCHYARD THE HEAVY HUMAN FACES AND THE BLACK DRAPERIES SHIVERING INTHE WIND SEEMED TO TELL OF A WORLD STRANGELY INCONGRUOUS WITH THELIGHTLY DROPPING BLOSSOMS AND THE GLEAMS OF SUNSHINE ON THE DAISIES.THE CLERGYMAN WHO MET THE PROCESSION WAS MR. CADWALLADERALSO ACCORDINGTO THE REQUEST OF PETER FEATHERSTONE PROMPTED AS USUAL BY PECULIARREASONS. HAVING A CONTEMPT FOR CURATES WHOM HE ALWAYS CALLEDUNDERSTRAPPERS HE WAS RESOLVED TO BE BURIED BY A BENEFICED CLERGYMAN.MR. CASAUBON WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOT MERELY BECAUSE HE DECLINEDDUTY OF THIS SORT BUT BECAUSE FEATHERSTONE HAD AN ESPECIAL DISLIKE TOHIM AS THE RECTOR OF HIS OWN PARISH WHO HAD A LIEN ON THE LAND IN THESHAPE OF TITHE ALSO AS THE DELIVERER OF MORNING SERMONS WHICH THE OLDMAN BEING IN HIS PEW AND NOT AT ALL SLEEPY HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO SITTHROUGH WITH AN INWARD SNARL. HE HAD AN OBJECTION TO A PARSON STUCK UPABOVE HIS HEAD PREACHING TO HIM. BUT HIS RELATIONS WITH MR. CADWALLADERHAD BEEN OF A DIFFERENT KIND THE TROUTSTREAM WHICH RAN THROUGH MR.CASAUBONS LAND TOOK ITS COURSE THROUGH FEATHERSTONES ALSO SO THATMR. CADWALLADER WAS A PARSON WHO HAD HAD TO ASK A FAVOR INSTEAD OFPREACHING. MOREOVER HE WAS ONE OF THE HIGH GENTRY LIVING FOUR MILESAWAY FROM LOWICK AND WAS THUS EXALTED TO AN EQUAL SKY WITH THE SHERIFFOF THE COUNTY AND OTHER DIGNITIES VAGUELY REGARDED AS NECESSARY TO THESYSTEM OF THINGS. THERE WOULD BE A SATISFACTION IN BEING BURIED BY MR.CADWALLADER WHOSE VERY NAME OFFERED A FINE OPPORTUNITY FOR PRONOUNCINGWRONGLY IF YOU LIKED.THIS DISTINCTION CONFERRED ON THE RECTOR OF TIPTON AND FRESHITT WAS THEREASON WHY MRS. CADWALLADER MADE ONE OF THE GROUP THAT WATCHED OLDFEATHERSTONES FUNERAL FROM AN UPPER WINDOW OF THE MANOR. SHE WAS NOTFOND OF VISITING THAT HOUSE BUT SHE LIKED AS SHE SAID TO SEECOLLECTIONS OF STRANGE ANIMALS SUCH AS THERE WOULD BE AT THIS FUNERALAND SHE HAD PERSUADED SIR JAMES AND THE YOUNG LADY CHETTAM TO DRIVE THERECTOR AND HERSELF TO LOWICK IN ORDER THAT THE VISIT MIGHT BEALTOGETHER PLEASANT.I WILL GO ANYWHERE WITH YOU MRS. CADWALLADER CELIA HAD SAID BUT IDONT LIKE FUNERALS.OH MY DEAR WHEN YOU HAVE A CLERGYMAN IN YOUR FAMILY YOU MUSTACCOMMODATE YOUR TASTES I DID THAT VERY EARLY. WHEN I MARRIED HUMPHREYI MADE UP MY MIND TO LIKE SERMONS AND I SET OUT BY LIKING THE END VERYMUCH. THAT SOON SPREAD TO THE MIDDLE AND THE BEGINNING BECAUSE ICOULDNT HAVE THE END WITHOUT THEM.NO TO BE SURE NOT SAID THE DOWAGER LADY CHETTAM WITH STATELYEMPHASIS.THE UPPER WINDOW FROM WHICH THE FUNERAL COULD BE WELL SEEN WAS IN THEROOM OCCUPIED BY MR. CASAUBON WHEN HE HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN TO WORK BUTHE HAD RESUMED NEARLY HIS HABITUAL STYLE OF LIFE NOW IN SPITE OFWARNINGS AND PRESCRIPTIONS AND AFTER POLITELY WELCOMING MRS.CADWALLADER HAD SLIPPED AGAIN INTO THE LIBRARY TO CHEW A CUD OF ERUDITEMISTAKE ABOUT CUSH AND MIZRAIM.BUT FOR HER VISITORS DOROTHEA TOO MIGHT HAVE BEEN SHUT UP IN THELIBRARY AND WOULD NOT HAVE WITNESSED THIS SCENE OF OLD FEATHERSTONESFUNERAL WHICH ALOOF AS IT SEEMED TO BE FROM THE TENOR OF HER LIFEALWAYS AFTERWARDS CAME BACK TO HER AT THE TOUCH OF CERTAIN SENSITIVEPOINTS IN MEMORY JUST AS THE VISION OF ST. PETERS AT ROME WAS INWOVENWITH MOODS OF DESPONDENCY. SCENES WHICH MAKE VITAL CHANGES IN OURNEIGHBORS LOT ARE BUT THE BACKGROUND OF OUR OWN YET LIKE APARTICULAR ASPECT OF THE FIELDS AND TREES THEY BECOME ASSOCIATED FORUS WITH THE EPOCHS OF OUR OWN HISTORY AND MAKE A PART OF THAT UNITYWHICH LIES IN THE SELECTION OF OUR KEENEST CONSCIOUSNESS.THE DREAMLIKE ASSOCIATION OF SOMETHING ALIEN AND ILLUNDERSTOOD WITHTHE DEEPEST SECRETS OF HER EXPERIENCE SEEMED TO MIRROR THAT SENSE OFLONELINESS WHICH WAS DUE TO THE VERY ARDOR OF DOROTHEAS NATURE. THECOUNTRY GENTRY OF OLD TIME LIVED IN A RAREFIED SOCIAL AIR DOTTED APARTON THEIR STATIONS UP THE MOUNTAIN THEY LOOKED DOWN WITH IMPERFECTDISCRIMINATION ON THE BELTS OF THICKER LIFE BELOW. AND DOROTHEA WAS NOTAT EASE IN THE PERSPECTIVE AND CHILLINESS OF THAT HEIGHT.I SHALL NOT LOOK ANY MORE SAID CELIA AFTER THE TRAIN HAD ENTEREDTHE CHURCH PLACING HERSELF A LITTLE BEHIND HER HUSBANDS ELBOW SO THATSHE COULD SLYLY TOUCH HIS COAT WITH HER CHEEK. I DARE SAY DODO LIKESIT SHE IS FOND OF MELANCHOLY THINGS AND UGLY PEOPLE.I AM FOND OF KNOWING SOMETHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE I LIVE AMONG SAIDDOROTHEA WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING EVERYTHING WITH THE INTEREST OF A MONKON HIS HOLIDAY TOUR. IT SEEMS TO ME WE KNOW NOTHING OF OUR NEIGHBORSUNLESS THEY ARE COTTAGERS. ONE IS CONSTANTLY WONDERING WHAT SORT OFLIVES OTHER PEOPLE LEAD AND HOW THEY TAKE THINGS. I AM QUITE OBLIGEDTO MRS. CADWALLADER FOR COMING AND CALLING ME OUT OF THE LIBRARY.QUITE RIGHT TO FEEL OBLIGED TO ME SAID MRS. CADWALLADER. YOUR RICHLOWICK FARMERS ARE AS CURIOUS AS ANY BUFFALOES OR BISONS AND I DARESAY YOU DONT HALF SEE THEM AT CHURCH. THEY ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROMYOUR UNCLES TENANTS OR SIR JAMESSMONSTERSFARMERS WITHOUTLANDLORDSONE CANT TELL HOW TO CLASS THEM.MOST OF THESE FOLLOWERS ARE NOT LOWICK PEOPLE SAID SIR JAMES ISUPPOSE THEY ARE LEGATEES FROM A DISTANCE OR FROM MIDDLEMARCH.LOVEGOOD TELLS ME THE OLD FELLOW HAS LEFT A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY AS WELLAS LAND.THINK OF THAT NOW WHEN SO MANY YOUNGER SONS CANT DINE AT THEIR OWNEXPENSE SAID MRS. CADWALLADER. AH TURNING ROUND AT THE SOUND OFTHE OPENING DOOR HERE IS MR. BROOKE. I FELT THAT WE WERE INCOMPLETEBEFORE AND HERE IS THE EXPLANATION. YOU ARE COME TO SEE THIS ODDFUNERAL OF COURSENO I CAME TO LOOK AFTER CASAUBONTO SEE HOW HE GOES ON YOU KNOW. ANDTO BRING A LITTLE NEWSA LITTLE NEWS MY DEAR SAID MR. BROOKENODDING AT DOROTHEA AS SHE CAME TOWARDS HIM. I LOOKED INTO THELIBRARY AND I SAW CASAUBON OVER HIS BOOKS. I TOLD HIM IT WOULDNT DOI SAID THIS WILL NEVER DO YOU KNOW THINK OF YOUR WIFE CASAUBON.AND HE PROMISED ME TO COME UP. I DIDNT TELL HIM MY NEWS I SAID HEMUST COME UP.AH NOW THEY ARE COMING OUT OF CHURCH MRS. CADWALLADER EXCLAIMED.DEAR ME WHAT A WONDERFULLY MIXED SET MR. LYDGATE AS DOCTOR ISUPPOSE. BUT THAT IS REALLY A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN AND THE FAIR YOUNGMAN MUST BE HER SON. WHO ARE THEY SIR JAMES DO YOU KNOWI SEE VINCY THE MAYOR OF MIDDLEMARCH THEY ARE PROBABLY HIS WIFE ANDSON SAID SIR JAMES LOOKING INTERROGATIVELY AT MR. BROOKE WHO NODDEDAND SAIDYES A VERY DECENT FAMILYA VERY GOOD FELLOW IS VINCY A CREDIT TO THEMANUFACTURING INTEREST. YOU HAVE SEEN HIM AT MY HOUSE YOU KNOW.AH YES ONE OF YOUR SECRET COMMITTEE SAID MRS. CADWALLADERPROVOKINGLY.A COURSING FELLOW THOUGH SAID SIR JAMES WITH A FOXHUNTERSDISGUST.AND ONE OF THOSE WHO SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF THE WRETCHED HANDLOOMWEAVERS IN TIPTON AND FRESHITT. THAT IS HOW HIS FAMILY LOOK SO FAIR ANDSLEEK SAID MRS. CADWALLADER. THOSE DARK PURPLEFACED PEOPLE ARE ANEXCELLENT FOIL. DEAR ME THEY ARE LIKE A SET OF JUGS DO LOOK ATHUMPHREY ONE MIGHT FANCY HIM AN UGLY ARCHANGEL TOWERING ABOVE THEM INHIS WHITE SURPLICE.ITS A SOLEMN THING THOUGH A FUNERAL SAID MR. BROOKE IF YOU TAKEIT IN THAT LIGHT YOU KNOW.BUT I AM NOT TAKING IT IN THAT LIGHT. I CANT WEAR MY SOLEMNITY TOOOFTEN ELSE IT WILL GO TO RAGS. IT WAS TIME THE OLD MAN DIED AND NONEOF THESE PEOPLE ARE SORRY.HOW PITEOUS SAID DOROTHEA. THIS FUNERAL SEEMS TO ME THE MOST DISMALTHING I EVER SAW. IT IS A BLOT ON THE MORNING. I CANNOT BEAR TO THINKTHAT ANY ONE SHOULD DIE AND LEAVE NO LOVE BEHIND.SHE WAS GOING TO SAY MORE BUT SHE SAW HER HUSBAND ENTER AND SEATHIMSELF A LITTLE IN THE BACKGROUND. THE DIFFERENCE HIS PRESENCE MADE TOHER WAS NOT ALWAYS A HAPPY ONE SHE FELT THAT HE OFTEN INWARDLYOBJECTED TO HER SPEECH.POSITIVELY EXCLAIMED MRS. CADWALLADER THERE IS A NEW FACE COME OUTFROM BEHIND THAT BROAD MAN QUEERER THAN ANY OF THEM A LITTLE ROUNDHEAD WITH BULGING EYESA SORT OF FROGFACEDO LOOK. HE MUST BE OFANOTHER BLOOD I THINK.LET ME SEE SAID CELIA WITH AWAKENED CURIOSITY STANDING BEHIND MRS.CADWALLADER AND LEANING FORWARD OVER HER HEAD. OH WHAT AN ODD FACETHEN WITH A QUICK CHANGE TO ANOTHER SORT OF SURPRISED EXPRESSION SHEADDED WHY DODO YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT MR. LADISLAW WAS COME AGAINDOROTHEA FELT A SHOCK OF ALARM EVERY ONE NOTICED HER SUDDEN PALENESSAS SHE LOOKED UP IMMEDIATELY AT HER UNCLE WHILE MR. CASAUBON LOOKED ATHER.HE CAME WITH ME YOU KNOW HE IS MY GUESTPUTS UP WITH ME AT THEGRANGE SAID MR. BROOKE IN HIS EASIEST TONE NODDING AT DOROTHEA ASIF THE ANNOUNCEMENT WERE JUST WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED. AND WEHAVE BROUGHT THE PICTURE AT THE TOP OF THE CARRIAGE. I KNEW YOU WOULDBE PLEASED WITH THE SURPRISE CASAUBON. THERE YOU ARE TO THE VERYLIFEAS AQUINAS YOU KNOW. QUITE THE RIGHT SORT OF THING. AND YOU WILLHEAR YOUNG LADISLAW TALK ABOUT IT. HE TALKS UNCOMMONLY WELLPOINTS OUTTHIS THAT AND THE OTHERKNOWS ART AND EVERYTHING OF THATKINDCOMPANIONABLE YOU KNOWIS UP WITH YOU IN ANY TRACKWHAT IVE BEENWANTING A LONG WHILE.MR. CASAUBON BOWED WITH COLD POLITENESS MASTERING HIS IRRITATION BUTONLY SO FAR AS TO BE SILENT. HE REMEMBERED WILLS LETTER QUITE AS WELLAS DOROTHEA DID HE HAD NOTICED THAT IT WAS NOT AMONG THE LETTERS WHICHHAD BEEN RESERVED FOR HIM ON HIS RECOVERY AND SECRETLY CONCLUDING THATDOROTHEA HAD SENT WORD TO WILL NOT TO COME TO LOWICK HE HAD SHRUNKWITH PROUD SENSITIVENESS FROM EVER RECURRING TO THE SUBJECT. HE NOWINFERRED THAT SHE HAD ASKED HER UNCLE TO INVITE WILL TO THE GRANGE ANDSHE FELT IT IMPOSSIBLE AT THAT MOMENT TO ENTER INTO ANY EXPLANATION.MRS. CADWALLADERS EYES DIVERTED FROM THE CHURCHYARD SAW A GOOD DEALOF DUMB SHOW WHICH WAS NOT SO INTELLIGIBLE TO HER AS SHE COULD HAVEDESIRED AND COULD NOT REPRESS THE QUESTION WHO IS MR. LADISLAWA YOUNG RELATIVE OF MR. CASAUBONS SAID SIR JAMES PROMPTLY. HISGOODNATURE OFTEN MADE HIM QUICK AND CLEARSEEING IN PERSONAL MATTERSAND HE HAD DIVINED FROM DOROTHEAS GLANCE AT HER HUSBAND THAT THERE WASSOME ALARM IN HER MIND.A VERY NICE YOUNG FELLOWCASAUBON HAS DONE EVERYTHING FOR HIMEXPLAINED MR. BROOKE. HE REPAYS YOUR EXPENSE IN HIM CASAUBON HEWENT ON NODDING ENCOURAGINGLY. I HOPE HE WILL STAY WITH ME A LONGWHILE AND WE SHALL MAKE SOMETHING OF MY DOCUMENTS. I HAVE PLENTY OFIDEAS AND FACTS YOU KNOW AND I CAN SEE HE IS JUST THE MAN TO PUT THEMINTO SHAPEREMEMBERS WHAT THE RIGHT QUOTATIONS ARE OMNE TULITPUNCTUM AND THAT SORT OF THINGGIVES SUBJECTS A KIND OF TURN. IINVITED HIM SOME TIME AGO WHEN YOU WERE ILL CASAUBON DOROTHEA SAIDYOU COULDNT HAVE ANYBODY IN THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND SHE ASKED ME TOWRITE.POOR DOROTHEA FELT THAT EVERY WORD OF HER UNCLES WAS ABOUT AS PLEASANTAS A GRAIN OF SAND IN THE EYE TO MR. CASAUBON. IT WOULD BE ALTOGETHERUNFITTING NOW TO EXPLAIN THAT SHE HAD NOT WISHED HER UNCLE TO INVITEWILL LADISLAW. SHE COULD NOT IN THE LEAST MAKE CLEAR TO HERSELF THEREASONS FOR HER HUSBANDS DISLIKE TO HIS PRESENCEA DISLIKE PAINFULLYIMPRESSED ON HER BY THE SCENE IN THE LIBRARY BUT SHE FELT THEUNBECOMINGNESS OF SAYING ANYTHING THAT MIGHT CONVEY A NOTION OF IT TOOTHERS. MR. CASAUBON INDEED HAD NOT THOROUGHLY REPRESENTED THOSEMIXED REASONS TO HIMSELF IRRITATED FEELING WITH HIM AS WITH ALL OFUS SEEKING RATHER FOR JUSTIFICATION THAN FOR SELFKNOWLEDGE. BUT HEWISHED TO REPRESS OUTWARD SIGNS AND ONLY DOROTHEA COULD DISCERN THECHANGES IN HER HUSBANDS FACE BEFORE HE OBSERVED WITH MORE OF DIGNIFIEDBENDING AND SINGSONG THAN USUALYOU ARE EXCEEDINGLY HOSPITABLE MY DEAR SIR AND I OWE YOUACKNOWLEDGMENTS FOR EXERCISING YOUR HOSPITALITY TOWARDS A RELATIVE OFMINE.THE FUNERAL WAS ENDED NOW AND THE CHURCHYARD WAS BEING CLEARED.NOW YOU CAN SEE HIM MRS.

I FEAR THEPART PLAYED BY THE VULTURES ON THAT OCCASION WOULD BE TOO PAINFUL FORART TO REPRESENT THOSE BIRDS BEING DISADVANTAGEOUSLY NAKED ABOUT THEGULLET AND APPARENTLY WITHOUT RITES AND CEREMONIES.THE SAME SORT OF TEMPTATION BEFELL THE CHRISTIAN CARNIVORA WHO FORMEDPETER FEATHERSTONES FUNERAL PROCESSION MOST OF THEM HAVING THEIRMINDS BENT ON A LIMITED STORE WHICH EACH WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THEMOST OF. THE LONGRECOGNIZED BLOODRELATIONS AND CONNECTIONS BYMARRIAGE MADE ALREADY A GOODLY NUMBER WHICH MULTIPLIED BYPOSSIBILITIES PRESENTED A FINE RANGE FOR JEALOUS CONJECTURE ANDPATHETIC HOPEFULNESS. JEALOUSY OF THE VINCYS HAD CREATED A FELLOWSHIPIN HOSTILITY AMONG ALL PERSONS OF THE FEATHERSTONE BLOOD SO THAT INTHE ABSENCE OF ANY DECIDED INDICATION THAT ONE OF THEMSELVES WAS TOHAVE MORE THAN THE REST THE DREAD LEST THAT LONGLEGGED FRED VINCYSHOULD HAVE THE LAND WAS NECESSARILY DOMINANT THOUGH IT LEFT ABUNDANTFEELING AND LEISURE FOR VAGUER JEALOUSIES SUCH AS WERE ENTERTAINEDTOWARDS MARY GARTH. SOLOMON FOUND TIME TO REFLECT THAT JONAH WASUNDESERVING AND JONAH TO ABUSE SOLOMON AS GREEDY JANE THE ELDERSISTER HELD THAT MARTHAS CHILDREN OUGHT NOT TO EXPECT SO MUCH AS THEYOUNG WAULES AND MARTHA MORE LAX ON THE SUBJECT OF PRIMOGENITURE WASSORRY TO THINK THAT JANE WAS SO HAVING. THESE NEAREST OF KIN WERENATURALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE UNREASONABLENESS OF EXPECTATIONS INCOUSINS AND SECOND COUSINS AND USED THEIR ARITHMETIC IN RECKONING THELARGE SUMS THAT SMALL LEGACIES MIGHT MOUNT TO IF THERE WERE TOO MANYOF THEM. TWO COUSINS WERE PRESENT TO HEAR THE WILL AND A SECOND COUSINBESIDES MR. TRUMBULL. THIS SECOND COUSIN WAS A MIDDLEMARCH MERCER OFPOLITE MANNERS AND SUPERFLUOUS ASPIRATES. THE TWO COUSINS WERE ELDERLYMEN FROM BRASSING ONE OF THEM CONSCIOUS OF CLAIMS ON THE SCORE OFINCONVENIENT EXPENSE SUSTAINED BY HIM IN PRESENTS OF OYSTERS AND OTHEREATABLES TO HIS RICH COUSIN PETER THE OTHER ENTIRELY SATURNINELEANING HIS HANDS AND CHIN ON A STICK AND CONSCIOUS OF CLAIMS BASED ONNO NARROW PERFORMANCE BUT ON MERIT GENERALLY BOTH BLAMELESS CITIZENSOF BRASSING WHO WISHED THAT JONAH FEATHERSTONE DID NOT LIVE THERE. THEWIT OF A FAMILY IS USUALLY BEST RECEIVED AMONG STRANGERS.WHY TRUMBULL HIMSELF IS PRETTY SURE OF FIVE HUNDREDTHAT YOU MAYDEPENDI SHOULDNT WONDER IF MY BROTHER PROMISED HIM SAID SOLOMONMUSING ALOUD WITH HIS SISTERS THE EVENING BEFORE THE FUNERAL.DEAR DEAR SAID POOR SISTER MARTHA WHOSE IMAGINATION OF HUNDREDSHAD BEEN HABITUALLY NARROWED TO THE AMOUNT OF HER UNPAID RENT.BUT IN THE MORNING ALL THE ORDINARY CURRENTS OF CONJECTURE WEREDISTURBED BY THE PRESENCE OF A STRANGE MOURNER WHO HAD PLASHED AMONGTHEM AS IF FROM THE MOON. THIS WAS THE STRANGER DESCRIBED BY MRS.CADWALLADER AS FROGFACED A MAN PERHAPS ABOUT TWO OR THREE AND THIRTYWHOSE PROMINENT EYES THINLIPPED DOWNWARDCURVED MOUTH AND HAIRSLEEKLY BRUSHED AWAY FROM A FOREHEAD THAT SANK SUDDENLY ABOVE THE RIDGEOF THE EYEBROWS CERTAINLY GAVE HIS FACE A BATRACHIAN UNCHANGEABLENESSOF EXPRESSION. HERE CLEARLY WAS A NEW LEGATEE ELSE WHY WAS HE BIDDENAS A MOURNER HERE WERE NEW POSSIBILITIES RAISING A NEW UNCERTAINTYWHICH ALMOST CHECKED REMARK IN THE MOURNINGCOACHES. WE ARE ALLHUMILIATED BY THE SUDDEN DISCOVERY OF A FACT WHICH HAS EXISTED VERYCOMFORTABLY AND PERHAPS BEEN STARING AT US IN PRIVATE WHILE WE HAVEBEEN MAKING UP OUR WORLD ENTIRELY WITHOUT IT. NO ONE HAD SEEN THISQUESTIONABLE STRANGER BEFORE EXCEPT MARY GARTH AND SHE KNEW NOTHINGMORE OF HIM THAN THAT HE HAD TWICE BEEN TO STONE COURT WHEN MR.FEATHERSTONE WAS DOWNSTAIRS AND HAD SAT ALONE WITH HIM FOR SEVERALHOURS. SHE HAD FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY OF MENTIONING THIS TO HER FATHERAND PERHAPS CALEBS WERE THE ONLY EYES EXCEPT THE LAWYERS WHICHEXAMINED THE STRANGER WITH MORE OF INQUIRY THAN OF DISGUST ORSUSPICION. CALEB GARTH HAVING LITTLE EXPECTATION AND LESS CUPIDITYWAS INTERESTED IN THE VERIFICATION OF HIS OWN GUESSES AND THE CALMNESSWITH WHICH HE HALF SMILINGLY RUBBED HIS CHIN AND SHOT INTELLIGENTGLANCES MUCH AS IF HE WERE VALUING A TREE MADE A FINE CONTRAST WITHTHE ALARM OR SCORN VISIBLE IN OTHER FACES WHEN THE UNKNOWN MOURNERWHOSE NAME WAS UNDERSTOOD TO BE RIGG ENTERED THE WAINSCOTED PARLOR ANDTOOK HIS SEAT NEAR THE DOOR TO MAKE PART OF THE AUDIENCE WHEN THE WILLSHOULD BE READ. JUST THEN MR. SOLOMON AND MR. JONAH WERE GONE UPSTAIRSWITH THE LAWYER TO SEARCH FOR THE WILL AND MRS. WAULE SEEING TWOVACANT SEATS BETWEEN HERSELF AND MR. BORTHROP TRUMBULL HAD THE SPIRITTO MOVE NEXT TO THAT GREAT AUTHORITY WHO WAS HANDLING HIS WATCHSEALSAND TRIMMING HIS OUTLINES WITH A DETERMINATION NOT TO SHOW ANYTHING SOCOMPROMISING TO A MAN OF ABILITY AS WONDER OR SURPRISE.I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT MY POOR BROTHERS DONE MR.TRUMBULL SAID MRS. WAULE IN THE LOWEST OF HER WOOLLY TONES WHILESHE TURNED HER CRAPESHADOWED BONNET TOWARDS MR. TRUMBULLS EAR.MY GOOD LADY WHATEVER WAS TOLD ME WAS TOLD IN CONFIDENCE SAID THEAUCTIONEER PUTTING HIS HAND UP TO SCREEN THAT SECRET.THEM WHOVE MADE SURE OF THEIR GOODLUCK MAY BE DISAPPOINTED YETMRS. WAULE CONTINUED FINDING SOME RELIEF IN THIS COMMUNICATION.HOPES ARE OFTEN DELUSIVE SAID MR. TRUMBULL STILL IN CONFIDENCE.AH SAID MRS. WAULE LOOKING ACROSS AT THE VINCYS AND THEN MOVINGBACK TO THE SIDE OF HER SISTER MARTHA.ITS WONDERFUL HOW CLOSE POOR PETER WAS SHE SAID IN THE SAMEUNDERTONES. WE NONE OF US KNOW WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE HAD ON HIS MIND. IONLY HOPE AND TRUST HE WASNT A WORSE LIVER THAN WE THINK OF MARTHA.POOR MRS. CRANCH WAS BULKY AND BREATHING ASTHMATICALLY HAD THEADDITIONAL MOTIVE FOR MAKING HER REMARKS UNEXCEPTIONABLE AND GIVINGTHEM A GENERAL BEARING THAT EVEN HER WHISPERS WERE LOUD AND LIABLE TOSUDDEN BURSTS LIKE THOSE OF A DERANGED BARRELORGAN.I NEVER WAS COVETOUS JANE SHE REPLIED BUT I HAVE SIX CHILDRENAND HAVE BURIED THREE AND I DIDNT MARRY INTO MONEY. THE ELDEST THATSITS THERE IS BUT NINETEENSO I LEAVE YOU TO GUESS. AND STOCK ALWAYSSHORT AND LAND MOST AWKWARD. BUT IF EVER IVE BEGGED AND PRAYED ITSBEEN TO GOD ABOVE THOUGH WHERE THERES ONE BROTHER A BACHELOR AND THEOTHER CHILDLESS AFTER TWICE MARRYINGANYBODY MIGHT THINKMEANWHILE MR. VINCY HAD GLANCED AT THE PASSIVE FACE OF MR. RIGG ANDHAD TAKEN OUT HIS SNUFFBOX AND TAPPED IT BUT HAD PUT IT AGAINUNOPENED AS AN INDULGENCE WHICH HOWEVER CLARIFYING TO THE JUDGMENTWAS UNSUITED TO THE OCCASION. I SHOULDNT WONDER IF FEATHERSTONE HADBETTER FEELINGS THAN ANY OF US GAVE HIM CREDIT FOR HE OBSERVED INTHE EAR OF HIS WIFE. THIS FUNERAL SHOWS A THOUGHT ABOUT EVERYBODY ITLOOKS WELL WHEN A MAN WANTS TO BE FOLLOWED BY HIS FRIENDS AND IF THEYARE HUMBLE NOT TO BE ASHAMED OF THEM. I SHOULD BE ALL THE BETTERPLEASED IF HED LEFT LOTS OF SMALL LEGACIES. THEY MAY BE UNCOMMONLYUSEFUL TO FELLOWS IN A SMALL WAY.EVERYTHING IS AS HANDSOME AS COULD BE CRAPE AND SILK AND EVERYTHINGSAID MRS. VINCY CONTENTEDLY.BUT I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT FRED WAS UNDER SOME DIFFICULTY IN REPRESSINGA LAUGH WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE UNSUITABLE THAN HIS FATHERSSNUFFBOX. FRED HAD OVERHEARD MR. JONAH SUGGESTING SOMETHING ABOUT ALOVECHILD AND WITH THIS THOUGHT IN HIS MIND THE STRANGERS FACEWHICH HAPPENED TO BE OPPOSITE HIM AFFECTED HIM TOO LUDICROUSLY. MARYGARTH DISCERNING HIS DISTRESS IN THE TWITCHINGS OF HIS MOUTH AND HISRECOURSE TO A COUGH CAME CLEVERLY TO HIS RESCUE BY ASKING HIM TOCHANGE SEATS WITH HER SO THAT HE GOT INTO A SHADOWY CORNER. FRED WASFEELING AS GOODNATUREDLY AS POSSIBLE TOWARDS EVERYBODY INCLUDINGRIGG AND HAVING SOME RELENTING TOWARDS ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE LESSLUCKY THAN HE WAS AWARE OF BEING HIMSELF HE WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLDHAVE BEHAVED AMISS STILL IT WAS PARTICULARLY EASY TO LAUGH.BUT THE ENTRANCE OF THE LAWYER AND THE TWO BROTHERS DREW EVERY ONESATTENTION. THE LAWYER WAS MR. STANDISH AND HE HAD COME TO STONE COURTTHIS MORNING BELIEVING THAT HE KNEW THOROUGHLY WELL WHO WOULD BEPLEASED AND WHO DISAPPOINTED BEFORE THE DAY WAS OVER. THE WILL HEEXPECTED TO READ WAS THE LAST OF THREE WHICH HE HAD DRAWN UP FOR MR.FEATHERSTONE. MR. STANDISH WAS NOT A MAN WHO VARIED HIS MANNERS HEBEHAVED WITH THE SAME DEEPVOICED OFFHAND CIVILITY TO EVERYBODY ASIF HE SAW NO DIFFERENCE IN THEM AND TALKED CHIEFLY OF THE HAYCROPWHICH WOULD BE VERY FINE BY GOD OF THE LAST BULLETINS CONCERNINGTHE KING AND OF THE DUKE OF CLARENCE WHO WAS A SAILOR EVERY INCH OFHIM AND JUST THE MAN TO RULE OVER AN ISLAND LIKE BRITAIN.OLD FEATHERSTONE HAD OFTEN REFLECTED AS HE SAT LOOKING AT THE FIRE THATSTANDISH WOULD BE SURPRISED SOME DAY IT IS TRUE THAT IF HE HAD DONE ASHE LIKED AT THE LAST AND BURNT THE WILL DRAWN UP BY ANOTHER LAWYER HEWOULD NOT HAVE SECURED THAT MINOR END STILL HE HAD HAD HIS PLEASURE INRUMINATING ON IT. AND CERTAINLY MR. STANDISH WAS SURPRISED BUT NOT ATALL SORRY ON THE CONTRARY HE RATHER ENJOYED THE ZEST OF A LITTLECURIOSITY IN HIS OWN MIND WHICH THE DISCOVERY OF A SECOND WILL ADDEDTO THE PROSPECTIVE AMAZEMENT ON THE PART OF THE FEATHERSTONE FAMILY.AS TO THE SENTIMENTS OF SOLOMON AND JONAH THEY WERE HELD IN UTTERSUSPENSE IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT THE OLD WILL WOULD HAVE A CERTAINVALIDITY AND THAT THERE MIGHT BE SUCH AN INTERLACEMENT OF POOR PETERSFORMER AND LATTER INTENTIONS AS TO CREATE ENDLESS LAWING BEFOREANYBODY CAME BY THEIR OWNAN INCONVENIENCE WHICH WOULD HAVE AT LEASTTHE ADVANTAGE OF GOING ALL ROUND. HENCE THE BROTHERS SHOWED ATHOROUGHLY NEUTRAL GRAVITY AS THEY REENTERED WITH MR. STANDISH BUTSOLOMON TOOK OUT HIS WHITE HANDKERCHIEF AGAIN WITH A SENSE THAT IN ANYCASE THERE WOULD BE AFFECTING PASSAGES AND CRYING AT FUNERALS HOWEVERDRY WAS CUSTOMARILY SERVED UP IN LAWN.PERHAPS THE PERSON WHO FELT THE MOST THROBBING EXCITEMENT AT THISMOMENT WAS MARY GARTH IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IT WAS SHE WHO HADVIRTUALLY DETERMINED THE PRODUCTION OF THIS SECOND WILL WHICH MIGHTHAVE MOMENTOUS EFFECTS ON THE LOT OF SOME PERSONS PRESENT. NO SOULEXCEPT HERSELF KNEW WHAT HAD PASSED ON THAT FINAL NIGHT.THE WILL I HOLD IN MY HAND SAID MR. STANDISH WHO SEATED AT THETABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM TOOK HIS TIME ABOUT EVERYTHINGINCLUDING THE COUGHS WITH WHICH HE SHOWED A DISPOSITION TO CLEAR HISVOICE WAS DRAWN UP BY MYSELF AND EXECUTED BY OUR DECEASED FRIEND ONTHE TH OF AUGUST . BUT I FIND THAT THERE IS A SUBSEQUENTINSTRUMENT HITHERTO UNKNOWN TO ME BEARING DATE THE TH OF JULY HARDLY A YEAR LATER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE. AND THERE IS FARTHER ISEEMR. STANDISH WAS CAUTIOUSLY TRAVELLING OVER THE DOCUMENT WITH HISSPECTACLESA CODICIL TO THIS LATTER WILL BEARING DATE MARCH  .DEAR DEAR SAID SISTER MARTHA NOT MEANING TO BE AUDIBLE BUT DRIVENTO SOME ARTICULATION UNDER THIS PRESSURE OF DATES.I SHALL BEGIN BY READING THE EARLIER WILL CONTINUED MR. STANDISHSINCE SUCH AS APPEARS BY HIS NOT HAVING DESTROYED THE DOCUMENT WASTHE INTENTION OF THE DECEASED.THE PREAMBLE WAS FELT TO BE RATHER LONG AND SEVERAL BESIDES SOLOMONSHOOK THEIR HEADS PATHETICALLY LOOKING ON THE GROUND ALL EYES AVOIDEDMEETING OTHER EYES AND WERE CHIEFLY FIXED EITHER ON THE SPOTS IN THETABLECLOTH OR ON MR. STANDISHS BALD HEAD EXCEPTING MARY GARTHS.WHEN ALL THE REST WERE TRYING TO LOOK NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR IT WASSAFE FOR HER TO LOOK AT THEM. AND AT THE SOUND OF THE FIRST GIVE ANDBEQUEATH SHE COULD SEE ALL COMPLEXIONS CHANGING SUBTLY AS IF SOMEFAINT VIBRATION WERE PASSING THROUGH THEM SAVE THAT OF MR. RIGG. HESAT IN UNALTERED CALM AND IN FACT THE COMPANY PREOCCUPIED WITH MOREIMPORTANT PROBLEMS AND WITH THE COMPLICATION OF LISTENING TO BEQUESTSWHICH MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE REVOKED HAD CEASED TO THINK OF HIM. FREDBLUSHED AND MR. VINCY FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO WITHOUT HIS SNUFFBOXIN HIS HAND THOUGH HE KEPT IT CLOSED.THE SMALL BEQUESTS CAME FIRST AND EVEN THE RECOLLECTION THAT THERE WASANOTHER WILL AND THAT POOR PETER MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT BETTER OF IT COULDNOT QUELL THE RISING DISGUST AND INDIGNATION. ONE LIKES TO BE DONE WELLBY IN EVERY TENSE PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE. AND HERE WAS PETERCAPABLE FIVE YEARS AGO OF LEAVING ONLY TWO HUNDRED APIECE TO HIS OWNBROTHERS AND SISTERS AND ONLY A HUNDRED APIECE TO HIS OWN NEPHEWS ANDNIECES THE GARTHS WERE NOT MENTIONED BUT MRS. VINCY AND ROSAMOND WEREEACH TO HAVE A HUNDRED. MR. TRUMBULL WAS TO HAVE THE GOLDHEADED CANEAND FIFTY POUNDS THE OTHER SECOND COUSINS AND THE COUSINS PRESENT WEREEACH TO HAVE THE LIKE HANDSOME SUM WHICH AS THE SATURNINE COUSINOBSERVED WAS A SORT OF LEGACY THAT LEFT A MAN NOWHERE AND THERE WASMUCH MORE OF SUCH OFFENSIVE DRIBBLING IN FAVOR OF PERSONS NOTPRESENTPROBLEMATICAL AND IT WAS TO BE FEARED LOW CONNECTIONS.ALTOGETHER RECKONING HASTILY HERE WERE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DISPOSEDOF. WHERE THEN HAD PETER MEANT THE REST OF THE MONEY TO GOAND WHERETHE LAND AND WHAT WAS REVOKED AND WHAT NOT REVOKEDAND WAS THEREVOCATION FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE ALL EMOTION MUST BE CONDITIONALAND MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE THE WRONG THING. THE MEN WERE STRONG ENOUGH TOBEAR UP AND KEEP QUIET UNDER THIS CONFUSED SUSPENSE SOME LETTING THEIRLOWER LIP FALL OTHERS PURSING IT UP ACCORDING TO THE HABIT OF THEIRMUSCLES. BUT JANE AND MARTHA SANK UNDER THE RUSH OF QUESTIONS ANDBEGAN TO CRY POOR MRS. CRANCH BEING HALF MOVED WITH THE CONSOLATION OFGETTING ANY HUNDREDS AT ALL WITHOUT WORKING FOR THEM AND HALF AWARETHAT HER SHARE WAS SCANTY WHEREAS MRS. WAULES MIND WAS ENTIRELYFLOODED WITH THE SENSE OF BEING AN OWN SISTER AND GETTING LITTLE WHILESOMEBODY ELSE WAS TO HAVE MUCH. THE GENERAL EXPECTATION NOW WAS THATTHE MUCH WOULD FALL TO FRED VINCY BUT THE VINCYS THEMSELVES WERESURPRISED WHEN TEN THOUSAND POUNDS IN SPECIFIED INVESTMENTS WEREDECLARED TO BE BEQUEATHED TO HIMWAS THE LAND COMING TOO FRED BIT HISLIPS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO HELP SMILING AND MRS. VINCY FELT HERSELF THEHAPPIEST OF WOMENPOSSIBLE REVOCATION SHRINKING OUT OF SIGHT IN THISDAZZLING VISION.THERE WAS STILL A RESIDUE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY AS WELL AS THE LAND BUTTHE WHOLE WAS LEFT TO ONE PERSON AND THAT PERSON WASO POSSIBILITIESO EXPECTATIONS FOUNDED ON THE FAVOR OF CLOSE OLD GENTLEMEN O ENDLESSVOCATIVES THAT WOULD STILL LEAVE EXPRESSION SLIPPING HELPLESS FROM THEMEASUREMENT OF MORTAL FOLLYTHAT RESIDUARY LEGATEE WAS JOSHUA RIGGWHO WAS ALSO SOLE EXECUTOR AND WHO WAS TO TAKE THENCEFORTH THE NAME OFFEATHERSTONE.THERE WAS A RUSTLING WHICH SEEMED LIKE A SHUDDER RUNNING ROUND THEROOM. EVERY ONE STARED AFRESH AT MR. RIGG WHO APPARENTLY EXPERIENCEDNO SURPRISE.A MOST SINGULAR TESTAMENTARY DISPOSITION EXCLAIMED MR. TRUMBULLPREFERRING FOR ONCE THAT HE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IGNORANT IN THE PAST.BUT THERE IS A SECOND WILLTHERE IS A FURTHER DOCUMENT. WE HAVE NOTYET HEARD THE FINAL WISHES OF THE DECEASED.MARY GARTH WAS FEELING THAT WHAT THEY HAD YET TO HEAR WERE NOT THEFINAL WISHES. THE SECOND WILL REVOKED EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE LEGACIES TOTHE LOW PERSONS BEFORE MENTIONED SOME ALTERATIONS IN THESE BEING THEOCCASION OF THE CODICIL AND THE BEQUEST OF ALL THE LAND LYING INLOWICK PARISH WITH ALL THE STOCK AND HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE TO JOSHUARIGG. THE RESIDUE OF THE PROPERTY WAS TO BE DEVOTED TO THE ERECTION ANDENDOWMENT OF ALMSHOUSES FOR OLD MEN TO BE CALLED FEATHERSTONESALMSHOUSES AND TO BE BUILT ON A PIECE OF LAND NEAR MIDDLEMARCHALREADY BOUGHT FOR THE PURPOSE BY THE TESTATOR HE WISHINGSO THEDOCUMENT DECLAREDTO PLEASE GOD ALMIGHTY. NOBODY PRESENT HAD AFARTHING BUT MR. TRUMBULL HAD THE GOLDHEADED CANE. IT TOOK SOME TIMEFOR THE COMPANY TO RECOVER THE POWER OF EXPRESSION. MARY DARED NOT LOOKAT FRED.MR. VINCY WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAKAFTER USING HIS SNUFFBOXENERGETICALLYAND HE SPOKE WITH LOUD INDIGNATION. THE MOSTUNACCOUNTABLE WILL I EVER HEARD I SHOULD SAY HE WAS NOT IN HIS RIGHTMIND WHEN HE MADE IT. I SHOULD SAY THIS LAST WILL WAS VOID ADDED MR.VINCY FEELING THAT THIS EXPRESSION PUT THE THING IN THE TRUE LIGHT.EH STANDISHOUR DECEASED FRIEND ALWAYS KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT I THINK SAID MR.STANDISH. EVERYTHING IS QUITE REGULAR. HERE IS A LETTER FROM CLEMMENSOF BRASSING TIED WITH THE WILL. HE DREW IT UP. A VERY RESPECTABLESOLICITOR.I NEVER NOTICED ANY ALIENATION OF MINDANY ABERRATION OF INTELLECT INTHE LATE MR. FEATHERSTONE SAID BORTHROP TRUMBULL BUT I CALL THISWILL ECCENTRIC. I WAS ALWAYS WILLINGLY OF SERVICE TO THE OLD SOUL ANDHE INTIMATED PRETTY PLAINLY A SENSE OF OBLIGATION WHICH WOULD SHOWITSELF IN HIS WILL. THE GOLDHEADED CANE IS FARCICAL CONSIDERED AS ANACKNOWLEDGMENT TO ME BUT HAPPILY I AM ABOVE MERCENARY CONSIDERATIONS.THERES NOTHING VERY SURPRISING IN THE MATTER THAT I CAN SEE SAIDCALEB GARTH. ANYBODY MIGHT HAVE HAD MORE REASON FOR WONDERING IF THEWILL HAD BEEN WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM AN OPENMINDED STRAIGHTFORWARDMAN. FOR MY PART I WISH THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS A WILL.THATS A STRANGE SENTIMENT TO COME FROM A CHRISTIAN MAN BY GOD SAIDTHE LAWYER. I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW YOU WILL BACK THAT UP GARTHOH SAID CALEB LEANING FORWARD ADJUSTING HIS FINGERTIPS WITHNICETY AND LOOKING MEDITATIVELY ON THE GROUND. IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO HIMTHAT WORDS WERE THE HARDEST PART OF BUSINESS.BUT HERE MR. JONAH FEATHERSTONE MADE HIMSELF HEARD. WELL HE ALWAYSWAS A FINE HYPOCRITE WAS MY BROTHER PETER. BUT THIS WILL CUTS OUTEVERYTHING. IF ID KNOWN A WAGON AND SIX HORSES SHOULDNT HAVE DRAWNME FROM BRASSING. ILL PUT A WHITE HAT AND DRAB COAT ON TOMORROW.DEAR DEAR WEPT MRS. CRANCH AND WEVE BEEN AT THE EXPENSE OFTRAVELLING AND THAT POOR LAD SITTING IDLE HERE SO LONG ITS THE FIRSTTIME I EVER HEARD MY BROTHER PETER WAS SO WISHFUL TO PLEASE GODALMIGHTY BUT IF I WAS TO BE STRUCK HELPLESS I MUST SAY ITS HARDI CANTHINK NO OTHER.ITLL DO HIM NO GOOD WHERE HES GONE THATS MY BELIEF SAID SOLOMONWITH A BITTERNESS WHICH WAS REMARKABLY GENUINE THOUGH HIS TONE COULDNOT HELP BEING SLY. PETER WAS A BAD LIVER AND ALMSHOUSES WONT COVERIT WHEN HES HAD THE IMPUDENCE TO SHOW IT AT THE LAST.AND ALL THE WHILE HAD GOT HIS OWN LAWFUL FAMILYBROTHERS AND SISTERSAND NEPHEWS AND NIECESAND HAS SAT IN CHURCH WITH EM WHENEVER HETHOUGHT WELL TO COME SAID MRS. WAULE. AND MIGHT HAVE LEFT HISPROPERTY SO RESPECTABLE TO THEM THATS NEVER BEEN USED TO EXTRAVAGANCEOR UNSTEADINESS IN NO MANNER OF WAYAND NOT SO POOR BUT WHAT THEY COULDHAVE SAVED EVERY PENNY AND MADE MORE OF IT. AND METHE TROUBLE IVEBEEN AT TIMES AND TIMES TO COME HERE AND BE SISTERLYAND HIM WITHTHINGS ON HIS MIND ALL THE WHILE THAT MIGHT MAKE ANYBODYS FLESH CREEP.BUT IF THE ALMIGHTYS ALLOWED IT HE MEANS TO PUNISH HIM FOR IT.BROTHER SOLOMON I SHALL BE GOING IF YOULL DRIVE ME.IVE NO DESIRE TO PUT MY FOOT ON THE PREMISES AGAIN SAID SOLOMON.IVE GOT LAND OF MY OWN AND PROPERTY OF MY OWN TO WILL AWAY.ITS A POOR TALE HOW LUCK GOES IN THE WORLD SAID JONAH. IT NEVERANSWERS TO HAVE A BIT OF SPIRIT IN YOU. YOUD BETTER BE A DOG IN THEMANGER. BUT THOSE ABOVE GROUND MIGHT LEARN A LESSON. ONE FOOLS WILL ISENOUGH IN A FAMILY.THERES MORE WAYS THAN ONE OF BEING A FOOL SAID SOLOMON. I SHANTLEAVE MY MONEY TO BE POURED DOWN THE SINK AND I SHANT LEAVE IT TOFOUNDLINGS FROM AFRICAY. I LIKE FEATHERSTONES THAT WERE BREWED SUCHAND NOT TURNED FEATHERSTONES WITH STICKING THE NAME ON EM.SOLOMON ADDRESSED THESE REMARKS IN A LOUD ASIDE TO MRS. WAULE AS HEROSE TO ACCOMPANY HER. BROTHER JONAH FELT HIMSELF CAPABLE OF MUCH MORESTINGING WIT THAN THIS BUT HE REFLECTED THAT THERE WAS NO USE INOFFENDING THE NEW PROPRIETOR OF STONE COURT UNTIL YOU WERE CERTAINTHAT HE WAS QUITE WITHOUT INTENTIONS OF HOSPITALITY TOWARDS WITTY MENWHOSE NAME HE WAS ABOUT TO BEAR.MR. JOSHUA RIGG IN FACT APPEARED TO TROUBLE HIMSELF LITTLE ABOUT ANYINNUENDOES BUT SHOWED A NOTABLE CHANGE OF MANNER WALKING COOLLY UP TOMR. STANDISH AND PUTTING BUSINESS QUESTIONS WITH MUCH COOLNESS. HE HADA HIGH CHIRPING VOICE AND A VILE ACCENT. FRED WHOM HE NO LONGER MOVEDTO LAUGHTER THOUGHT HIM THE LOWEST MONSTER HE HAD EVER SEEN. BUT FREDWAS FEELING RATHER SICK. THE MIDDLEMARCH MERCER WAITED FOR ANOPPORTUNITY OF ENGAGING MR. RIGG IN CONVERSATION THERE WAS NO KNOWINGHOW MANY PAIRS OF LEGS THE NEW PROPRIETOR MIGHT REQUIRE HOSE FOR ANDPROFITS WERE MORE TO BE RELIED ON THAN LEGACIES. ALSO THE MERCER AS ASECOND COUSIN WAS DISPASSIONATE ENOUGH TO FEEL CURIOSITY.MR. VINCY AFTER HIS ONE OUTBURST HAD REMAINED PROUDLY SILENT THOUGHTOO MUCH PREOCCUPIED WITH UNPLEASANT FEELINGS TO THINK OF MOVING TILLHE OBSERVED THAT HIS WIFE HAD GONE TO FREDS SIDE AND WAS CRYINGSILENTLY WHILE SHE HELD HER DARLINGS HAND. HE ROSE IMMEDIATELY ANDTURNING HIS BACK ON THE COMPANY WHILE HE SAID TO HER IN ANUNDERTONEDONT GIVE WAY LUCY DONT MAKE A FOOL OF YOURSELF MYDEAR BEFORE THESE PEOPLE HE ADDED IN HIS USUAL LOUD VOICEGO ANDORDER THE PHAETON FRED I HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE.MARY GARTH HAD BEFORE THIS BEEN GETTING READY TO GO HOME WITH HERFATHER. SHE MET FRED IN THE HALL AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME HAD THECOURAGE TO LOOK AT HIM. HE HAD THAT WITHERED SORT OF PALENESS WHICHWILL SOMETIMES COME ON YOUNG FACES AND HIS HAND WAS VERY COLD WHEN SHESHOOK IT. MARY TOO WAS AGITATED SHE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT FATALLYWITHOUT WILL OF HER OWN SHE HAD PERHAPS MADE A GREAT DIFFERENCE TOFREDS LOT.GOODBY SHE SAID WITH AFFECTIONATE SADNESS. BE BRAVE FRED. I DOBELIEVE YOU ARE BETTER WITHOUT THE MONEY. WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF IT TOMR. FEATHERSTONETHATS ALL VERY FINE SAID FRED PETTISHLY. WHAT IS A FELLOW TO DOI MUST GO INTO THE CHURCH NOW. HE KNEW THAT THIS WOULD VEX MARY VERYWELL THEN SHE MUST TELL HIM WHAT ELSE HE COULD DO. AND I THOUGHT ISHOULD BE ABLE TO PAY YOUR FATHER AT ONCE AND MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT.AND YOU HAVE NOT EVEN A HUNDRED POUNDS LEFT YOU. WHAT SHALL YOU DO NOWMARYTAKE ANOTHER SITUATION OF COURSE AS SOON AS I CAN GET ONE. MY FATHERHAS ENOUGH TO DO TO KEEP THE REST WITHOUT ME. GOODBY.IN A VERY SHORT TIME STONE COURT WAS CLEARED OF WELLBREWEDFEATHERSTONES AND OTHER LONGACCUSTOMED VISITORS. ANOTHER STRANGER HADBEEN BROUGHT TO SETTLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MIDDLEMARCH BUT IN THECASE OF MR. RIGG FEATHERSTONE THERE WAS MORE DISCONTENT WITH IMMEDIATEVISIBLE CONSEQUENCES THAN SPECULATION AS TO THE EFFECT WHICH HISPRESENCE MIGHT HAVE IN THE FUTURE. NO SOUL WAS PROPHETIC ENOUGH TO HAVEANY FOREBODING AS TO WHAT MIGHT APPEAR ON THE TRIAL OF JOSHUA RIGG.AND HERE I AM NATURALLY LED TO REFLECT ON THE MEANS OF ELEVATING A LOWSUBJECT. HISTORICAL PARALLELS ARE REMARKABLY EFFICIENT IN THIS WAY. THECHIEF OBJECTION TO THEM IS THAT THE DILIGENT NARRATOR MAY LACK SPACEOR WHAT IS OFTEN THE SAME THING MAY NOT BE ABLE TO THINK OF THEM WITHANY DEGREE OF PARTICULARITY THOUGH HE MAY HAVE A PHILOSOPHICALCONFIDENCE THAT IF KNOWN THEY WOULD BE ILLUSTRATIVE. IT SEEMS AN EASIERAND SHORTER WAY TO DIGNITY TO OBSERVE THATSINCE THERE NEVER WAS ATRUE STORY WHICH COULD NOT BE TOLD IN PARABLES WHERE YOU MIGHT PUT AMONKEY FOR A MARGRAVE AND VICE VERSAWHATEVER HAS BEEN OR IS TO BENARRATED BY ME ABOUT LOW PEOPLE MAY BE ENNOBLED BY BEING CONSIDERED APARABLE SO THAT IF ANY BAD HABITS AND UGLY CONSEQUENCES ARE BROUGHTINTO VIEW THE READER MAY HAVE THE RELIEF OF REGARDING THEM AS NOT MORETHAN FIGURATIVELY UNGENTEEL AND MAY FEEL HIMSELF VIRTUALLY IN COMPANYWITH PERSONS OF SOME STYLE. THUS WHILE I TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT LOOBIESMY READERS IMAGINATION NEED NOT BE ENTIRELY EXCLUDED FROM ANOCCUPATION WITH LORDS AND THE PETTY SUMS WHICH ANY BANKRUPT OF HIGHSTANDING WOULD BE SORRY TO RETIRE UPON MAY BE LIFTED TO THE LEVEL OFHIGH COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS BY THE INEXPENSIVE ADDITION OFPROPORTIONAL CIPHERS.AS TO ANY PROVINCIAL HISTORY IN WHICH THE AGENTS ARE ALL OF HIGH MORALRANK THAT MUST BE OF A DATE LONG POSTERIOR TO THE FIRST REFORM BILLAND PETER FEATHERSTONE YOU PERCEIVE WAS DEAD AND BURIED SOME MONTHSBEFORE LORD GREY CAME INTO OFFICE.CHAPTER XXXVI.T IS STRANGE TO SEE THE HUMORS OF THESE MENTHESE GREAT ASPIRING SPIRITS THAT SHOULD BE WISE. . . . . . . .FOR BEING THE NATURE OF GREAT SPIRITS TO LOVETO BE WHERE THEY MAY BE MOST EMINENTTHEY RATING OF THEMSELVES SO FARRE ABOVEUS IN CONCEIT WITH WHOM THEY DO FREQUENTIMAGINE HOW WE WONDER AND ESTEEMEALL THAT THEY DO OR SAY WHICH MAKES THEM STRIVETO MAKE OUR ADMIRATION MORE EXTREMEWHICH THEY SUPPOSE THEY CANNOT LESS THEY GIVENOTICE OF THEIR EXTREME AND HIGHEST THOUGHTS.DANIEL TRAGEDY OF PHILOTAS.MR. VINCY WENT HOME FROM THE READING OF THE WILL WITH HIS POINT OF VIEWCONSIDERABLY CHANGED IN RELATION TO MANY SUBJECTS. HE WAS ANOPENMINDED MAN BUT GIVEN TO INDIRECT MODES OF EXPRESSING HIMSELFWHEN HE WAS DISAPPOINTED IN A MARKET FOR HIS SILK BRAIDS HE SWORE ATTHE GROOM WHEN HIS BROTHERINLAW BULSTRODE HAD VEXED HIM HE MADECUTTING REMARKS ON METHODISM AND IT WAS NOW APPARENT THAT HE REGARDEDFREDS IDLENESS WITH A SUDDEN INCREASE OF SEVERITY BY HIS THROWING ANEMBROIDERED CAP OUT OF THE SMOKINGROOM ON TO THE HALLFLOOR.WELL SIR HE OBSERVED WHEN THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN WAS MOVING OFF TOBED I HOPE YOUVE MADE UP YOUR MIND NOW TO GO UP NEXT TERM AND PASSYOUR EXAMINATION. IVE TAKEN MY RESOLUTION SO I ADVISE YOU TO LOSE NOTIME IN TAKING YOURS.FRED MADE NO ANSWER HE WAS TOO UTTERLY DEPRESSED. TWENTYFOUR HOURSAGO HE HAD THOUGHT THAT INSTEAD OF NEEDING TO KNOW WHAT HE SHOULD DOHE SHOULD BY THIS TIME KNOW THAT HE NEEDED TO DO NOTHING THAT HESHOULD HUNT IN PINK HAVE A FIRSTRATE HUNTER RIDE TO COVER ON A FINEHACK AND BE GENERALLY RESPECTED FOR DOING SO MOREOVER THAT HE SHOULDBE ABLE AT ONCE TO PAY MR. GARTH AND THAT MARY COULD NO LONGER HAVEANY REASON FOR NOT MARRYING HIM. AND ALL THIS WAS TO HAVE COME WITHOUTSTUDY OR OTHER INCONVENIENCE PURELY BY THE FAVOR OF PROVIDENCE IN THESHAPE OF AN OLD GENTLEMANS CAPRICE. BUT NOW AT THE END OF THETWENTYFOUR HOURS ALL THOSE FIRM EXPECTATIONS WERE UPSET. IT WASRATHER HARD LINES THAT WHILE HE WAS SMARTING UNDER THISDISAPPOINTMENT HE SHOULD BE TREATED AS IF HE COULD HAVE HELPED IT. BUTHE WENT AWAY SILENTLY AND HIS MOTHER PLEADED FOR HIM.DONT BE HARD ON THE POOR BOY VINCY. HELL TURN OUT WELL YET THOUGHTHAT WICKED MAN HAS DECEIVED HIM. I FEEL AS SURE AS I SIT HERE FREDWILL TURN OUT WELLELSE WHY WAS HE BROUGHT BACK FROM THE BRINK OF THEGRAVE AND I CALL IT A ROBBERY IT WAS LIKE GIVING HIM THE LAND TOPROMISE IT AND WHAT IS PROMISING IF MAKING EVERYBODY BELIEVE IS NOTPROMISING AND YOU SEE HE DID LEAVE HIM TEN THOUSAND POUNDS AND THENTOOK IT AWAY AGAIN.TOOK IT AWAY AGAIN SAID MR. VINCY PETTISHLY. I TELL YOU THE LADSAN UNLUCKY LAD LUCY. AND YOUVE ALWAYS SPOILED HIM.WELL VINCY HE WAS MY FIRST AND YOU MADE A FINE FUSS WITH HIM WHENHE CAME. YOU WERE AS PROUD AS PROUD SAID MRS. VINCY EASILYRECOVERING HER CHEERFUL SMILE.WHO KNOWS WHAT BABIES WILL TURN TO I WAS FOOL ENOUGH I DARE SAYSAID THE HUSBANDMORE MILDLY HOWEVER.BUT WHO HAS HANDSOMER BETTER CHILDREN THAN OURS FRED IS FAR BEYONDOTHER PEOPLES SONS YOU MAY HEAR IT IN HIS SPEECH THAT HE HAS KEPTCOLLEGE COMPANY. AND ROSAMONDWHERE IS THERE A GIRL LIKE HER SHE MIGHTSTAND BESIDE ANY LADY IN THE LAND AND ONLY LOOK THE BETTER FOR IT. YOUSEEMR. LYDGATE HAS KEPT THE HIGHEST COMPANY AND BEEN EVERYWHERE ANDHE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER AT ONCE. NOT BUT WHAT I COULD HAVE WISHEDROSAMOND HAD NOT ENGAGED HERSELF. SHE MIGHT HAVE MET SOMEBODY ON AVISIT WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN A FAR BETTER MATCH I MEAN AT HERSCHOOLFELLOW MISS WILLOUGHBYS. THERE ARE RELATIONS IN THAT FAMILYQUITE AS HIGH AS MR. LYDGATES.DAMN RELATIONS SAID MR. VINCY IVE HAD ENOUGH OF THEM. I DONTWANT A SONINLAW WHO HAS GOT NOTHING BUT HIS RELATIONS TO RECOMMENDHIM.WHY MY DEAR SAID MRS. VINCY YOU SEEMED AS PLEASED AS COULD BEABOUT IT. ITS TRUE I WASNT AT HOME BUT ROSAMOND TOLD ME YOU HADNTA WORD TO SAY AGAINST THE ENGAGEMENT. AND SHE HAS BEGUN TO BUY IN THEBEST LINEN AND CAMBRIC FOR HER UNDERCLOTHING.NOT BY MY WILL SAID MR. VINCY. I SHALL HAVE ENOUGH TO DO THIS YEARWITH AN IDLE SCAMP OF A SON WITHOUT PAYING FOR WEDDINGCLOTHES. THETIMES ARE AS TIGHT AS CAN BE EVERYBODY IS BEING RUINED AND I DONTBELIEVE LYDGATE HAS GOT A FARTHING. I SHANT GIVE MY CONSENT TO THEIRMARRYING. LET EM WAIT AS THEIR ELDERS HAVE DONE BEFORE EM.ROSAMOND WILL TAKE IT HARD VINCY AND YOU KNOW YOU NEVER COULD BEARTO CROSS HER.YES I COULD. THE SOONER THE ENGAGEMENTS OFF THE BETTER. I DONTBELIEVE HELL EVER MAKE AN INCOME THE WAY HE GOES ON. HE MAKESENEMIES THATS ALL I HEAR OF HIS MAKING.BUT HE STANDS VERY HIGH WITH MR. BULSTRODE MY DEAR. THE MARRIAGEWOULD PLEASE HIM I SHOULD THINK.PLEASE THE DEUCE SAID MR. VINCY. BULSTRODE WONT PAY FOR THEIRKEEP. AND IF LYDGATE THINKS IM GOING TO GIVE MONEY FOR THEM TO SET UPHOUSEKEEPING HES MISTAKEN THATS ALL. I EXPECT I SHALL HAVE TO PUTDOWN MY HORSES SOON. YOUD BETTER TELL ROSY WHAT I SAY.THIS WAS A NOT INFREQUENT PROCEDURE WITH MR. VINCYTO BE RASH IN JOVIALASSENT AND ON BECOMING SUBSEQUENTLY CONSCIOUS THAT HE HAD BEEN RASHTO EMPLOY OTHERS IN MAKING THE OFFENSIVE RETRACTATION. HOWEVER MRS.VINCY WHO NEVER WILLINGLY OPPOSED HER HUSBAND LOST NO TIME THE NEXTMORNING IN LETTING ROSAMOND KNOW WHAT HE HAD SAID. ROSAMOND EXAMININGSOME MUSLINWORK LISTENED IN SILENCE AND AT THE END GAVE A CERTAINTURN OF HER GRACEFUL NECK OF WHICH ONLY LONG EXPERIENCE COULD TEACHYOU THAT IT MEANT PERFECT OBSTINACY.WHAT DO YOU SAY MY DEAR SAID HER MOTHER WITH AFFECTIONATEDEFERENCE.PAPA DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING OF THE KIND SAID ROSAMOND QUITE CALMLY.HE HAS ALWAYS SAID THAT HE WISHED ME TO MARRY THE MAN I LOVED. AND ISHALL MARRY MR. LYDGATE. IT IS SEVEN WEEKS NOW SINCE PAPA GAVE HISCONSENT. AND I HOPE WE SHALL HAVE MRS. BRETTONS HOUSE.WELL MY DEAR I SHALL LEAVE YOU TO MANAGE YOUR PAPA. YOU ALWAYS DOMANAGE EVERYBODY. BUT IF WE EVER DO GO AND GET DAMASK SADLERS IS THEPLACEFAR BETTER THAN HOPKINSS. MRS. BRETTONS IS VERY LARGE THOUGHI SHOULD LOVE YOU TO HAVE SUCH A HOUSE BUT IT WILL TAKE A GREAT DEALOF FURNITURECARPETING AND EVERYTHING BESIDES PLATE AND GLASS. AND YOUHEAR YOUR PAPA SAYS HE WILL GIVE NO MONEY. DO YOU THINK MR. LYDGATEEXPECTS ITYOU CANNOT IMAGINE THAT I SHOULD ASK HIM MAMMA. OF COURSE HEUNDERSTANDS HIS OWN AFFAIRS.BUT HE MAY HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR MONEY MY DEAR AND WE ALL THOUGHT OFYOUR HAVING A PRETTY LEGACY AS WELL AS FREDAND NOW EVERYTHING IS SODREADFULTHERES NO PLEASURE IN THINKING OF ANYTHING WITH THAT POORBOY DISAPPOINTED AS HE IS.THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY MARRIAGE MAMMA. FRED MUST LEAVE OFFBEING IDLE. I AM GOING UPSTAIRS TO TAKE THIS WORK TO MISS MORGAN SHEDOES THE OPEN HEMMING VERY WELL. MARY GARTH MIGHT DO SOME WORK FOR MENOW I SHOULD THINK. HER SEWING IS EXQUISITE IT IS THE NICEST THING IKNOW ABOUT MARY. I SHOULD SO LIKE TO HAVE ALL MY CAMBRIC FRILLINGDOUBLEHEMMED. AND IT TAKES A LONG TIME.MRS. VINCYS BELIEF THAT ROSAMOND COULD MANAGE HER PAPA WAS WELLFOUNDED. APART FROM HIS DINNERS AND HIS COURSING MR. VINCY BLUSTERINGAS HE WAS HAD AS LITTLE OF HIS OWN WAY AS IF HE HAD BEEN A PRIMEMINISTER THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES WAS EASILY TOO MUCH FOR HIM AS ITIS FOR MOST PLEASURELOVING FLORID MEN AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE CALLEDROSAMOND WAS PARTICULARLY FORCIBLE BY MEANS OF THAT MILD PERSISTENCEWHICH AS WE KNOW ENABLES A WHITE SOFT LIVING SUBSTANCE TO MAKE ITSWAY IN SPITE OF OPPOSING ROCK. PAPA WAS NOT A ROCK HE HAD NO OTHERFIXITY THAN THAT FIXITY OF ALTERNATING IMPULSES SOMETIMES CALLED HABITAND THIS WAS ALTOGETHER UNFAVORABLE TO HIS TAKING THE ONLY DECISIVELINE OF CONDUCT IN RELATION TO HIS DAUGHTERS ENGAGEMENTNAMELY TOINQUIRE THOROUGHLY INTO LYDGATES CIRCUMSTANCES DECLARE HIS OWNINABILITY TO FURNISH MONEY AND FORBID ALIKE EITHER A SPEEDY MARRIAGEOR AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH MUST BE TOO LENGTHY. THAT SEEMS VERY SIMPLE ANDEASY IN THE STATEMENT BUT A DISAGREEABLE RESOLVE FORMED IN THE CHILLHOURS OF THE MORNING HAD AS MANY CONDITIONS AGAINST IT AS THE EARLYFROST AND RARELY PERSISTED UNDER THE WARMING INFLUENCES OF THE DAY.THE INDIRECT THOUGH EMPHATIC EXPRESSION OF OPINION TO WHICH MR. VINCYWAS PRONE SUFFERED MUCH RESTRAINT IN THIS CASE LYDGATE WAS A PROUD MANTOWARDS WHOM INNUENDOES WERE OBVIOUSLY UNSAFE AND THROWING HIS HAT ONTHE FLOOR WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION. MR. VINCY WAS A LITTLE IN AWE OFHIM A LITTLE VAIN THAT HE WANTED TO MARRY ROSAMOND A LITTLEINDISPOSED TO RAISE A QUESTION OF MONEY IN WHICH HIS OWN POSITION WASNOT ADVANTAGEOUS A LITTLE AFRAID OF BEING WORSTED IN DIALOGUE WITH AMAN BETTER EDUCATED AND MORE HIGHLY BRED THAN HIMSELF AND A LITTLEAFRAID OF DOING WHAT HIS DAUGHTER WOULD NOT LIKE. THE PART MR. VINCYPREFERRED PLAYING WAS THAT OF THE GENEROUS HOST WHOM NOBODY CRITICISES.IN THE EARLIER HALF OF THE DAY THERE WAS BUSINESS TO HINDER ANY FORMALCOMMUNICATION OF AN ADVERSE RESOLVE IN THE LATER THERE WAS DINNERWINE WHIST AND GENERAL SATISFACTION. AND IN THE MEAN WHILE THE HOURSWERE EACH LEAVING THEIR LITTLE DEPOSIT AND GRADUALLY FORMING THE FINALREASON FOR INACTION NAMELY THAT ACTION WAS TOO LATE. THE ACCEPTEDLOVER SPENT MOST OF HIS EVENINGS IN LOWICK GATE AND A LOVEMAKING NOTAT ALL DEPENDENT ON MONEYADVANCES FROM FATHERSINLAW OR PROSPECTIVEINCOME FROM A PROFESSION WENT ON FLOURISHINGLY UNDER MR. VINCYS OWNEYES. YOUNG LOVEMAKINGTHAT GOSSAMER WEB EVEN THE POINTS IT CLINGSTOTHE THINGS WHENCE ITS SUBTLE INTERLACINGS ARE SWUNGARE SCARCELYPERCEPTIBLE MOMENTARY TOUCHES OF FINGERTIPS MEETINGS OF RAYS FROMBLUE AND DARK ORBS UNFINISHED PHRASES LIGHTEST CHANGES OF CHEEK ANDLIP FAINTEST TREMORS. THE WEB ITSELF IS MADE OF SPONTANEOUS BELIEFSAND INDEFINABLE JOYS YEARNINGS OF ONE LIFE TOWARDS ANOTHER VISIONS OFCOMPLETENESS INDEFINITE TRUST. AND LYDGATE FELL TO SPINNING THAT WEBFROM HIS INWARD SELF WITH WONDERFUL RAPIDITY IN SPITE OF EXPERIENCESUPPOSED TO BE FINISHED OFF WITH THE DRAMA OF LAUREIN SPITE TOO OFMEDICINE AND BIOLOGY FOR THE INSPECTION OF MACERATED MUSCLE OR OF EYESPRESENTED IN A DISH LIKE SANTA LUCIAS AND OTHER INCIDENTS OFSCIENTIFIC INQUIRY ARE OBSERVED TO BE LESS INCOMPATIBLE WITH POETICLOVE THAN A NATIVE DULNESS OR A LIVELY ADDICTION TO THE LOWEST PROSE.AS FOR ROSAMOND SHE WAS IN THE WATERLILYS EXPANDING WONDERMENT ATITS OWN FULLER LIFE AND SHE TOO WAS SPINNING INDUSTRIOUSLY AT THEMUTUAL WEB. ALL THIS WENT ON IN THE CORNER OF THE DRAWINGROOM WHERETHE PIANO STOOD AND SUBTLE AS IT WAS THE LIGHT MADE IT A SORT OFRAINBOW VISIBLE TO MANY OBSERVERS BESIDES MR. FAREBROTHER. THECERTAINTY THAT MISS VINCY AND MR. LYDGATE WERE ENGAGED BECAME GENERALIN MIDDLEMARCH WITHOUT THE AID OF FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT.AUNT BULSTRODE WAS AGAIN STIRRED TO ANXIETY BUT THIS TIME SHEADDRESSED HERSELF TO HER BROTHER GOING TO THE WAREHOUSE EXPRESSLY TOAVOID MRS. VINCYS VOLATILITY. HIS REPLIES WERE NOT SATISFACTORY.WALTER YOU NEVER MEAN TO TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE ALLOWED ALL THIS TO GOON WITHOUT INQUIRY INTO MR. LYDGATES PROSPECTS SAID MRS. BULSTRODEOPENING HER EYES WITH WIDER GRAVITY AT HER BROTHER WHO WAS IN HISPEEVISH WAREHOUSE HUMOR. THINK OF THIS GIRL BROUGHT UP IN LUXURYINTOO WORLDLY A WAY I AM SORRY TO SAYWHAT WILL SHE DO ON A SMALLINCOMEOH CONFOUND IT HARRIET WHAT CAN I DO WHEN MEN COME INTO THE TOWNWITHOUT ANY ASKING OF MINE DID YOU SHUT YOUR HOUSE UP AGAINST LYDGATEBULSTRODE HAS PUSHED HIM FORWARD MORE THAN ANYBODY. I NEVER MADE ANYFUSS ABOUT THE YOUNG FELLOW. YOU SHOULD GO AND TALK TO YOUR HUSBANDABOUT IT NOT ME.WELL REALLY WALTER HOW CAN MR. BULSTRODE BE TO BLAME I AM SURE HEDID NOT WISH FOR THE ENGAGEMENT.OH IF BULSTRODE HAD NOT TAKEN HIM BY THE HAND I SHOULD NEVER HAVEINVITED HIM.BUT YOU CALLED HIM IN TO ATTEND ON FRED AND I AM SURE THAT WAS AMERCY SAID MRS. BULSTRODE LOSING HER CLEW IN THE INTRICACIES OF THESUBJECT.I DONT KNOW ABOUT MERCY SAID MR. VINCY TESTILY. I KNOW I AMWORRIED MORE THAN I LIKE WITH MY FAMILY. I WAS A GOOD BROTHER TO YOUHARRIET BEFORE YOU MARRIED BULSTRODE AND I MUST SAY HE DOESNT ALWAYSSHOW THAT FRIENDLY SPIRIT TOWARDS YOUR FAMILY THAT MIGHT HAVE BEENEXPECTED OF HIM. MR. VINCY WAS VERY LITTLE LIKE A JESUIT BUT NOACCOMPLISHED JESUIT COULD HAVE TURNED A QUESTION MORE ADROITLY. HARRIETHAD TO DEFEND HER HUSBAND INSTEAD OF BLAMING HER BROTHER AND THECONVERSATION ENDED AT A POINT AS FAR FROM THE BEGINNING AS SOME RECENTSPARRING BETWEEN THE BROTHERSINLAW AT A VESTRY MEETING.MRS. BULSTRODE DID NOT REPEAT HER BROTHERS COMPLAINTS TO HER HUSBANDBUT IN THE EVENING SHE SPOKE TO HIM OF LYDGATE AND ROSAMOND. HE DID NOTSHARE HER WARM INTEREST HOWEVER AND ONLY SPOKE WITH RESIGNATION OFTHE RISKS ATTENDANT ON THE BEGINNING OF MEDICAL PRACTICE AND THEDESIRABILITY OF PRUDENCE.I AM SURE WE ARE BOUND TO PRAY FOR THAT THOUGHTLESS GIRLBROUGHT UP ASSHE HAS BEEN SAID MRS. BULSTRODE WISHING TO ROUSE HER HUSBANDSFEELINGS.TRULY MY DEAR SAID MR. BULSTRODE ASSENTINGLY. THOSE WHO ARE NOTOF THIS WORLD CAN DO LITTLE ELSE TO ARREST THE ERRORS OF THEOBSTINATELY WORLDLY. THAT IS WHAT WE MUST ACCUSTOM OURSELVES TORECOGNIZE WITH REGARD TO YOUR BROTHERS FAMILY. I COULD HAVE WISHEDTHAT MR. LYDGATE HAD NOT ENTERED INTO SUCH A UNION BUT MY RELATIONSWITH HIM ARE LIMITED TO THAT USE OF HIS GIFTS FOR GODS PURPOSES WHICHIS TAUGHT US BY THE DIVINE GOVERNMENT UNDER EACH DISPENSATION.MRS. BULSTRODE SAID NO MORE ATTRIBUTING SOME DISSATISFACTION WHICH SHEFELT TO HER OWN WANT OF SPIRITUALITY. SHE BELIEVED THAT HER HUSBAND WASONE OF THOSE MEN WHOSE MEMOIRS SHOULD BE WRITTEN WHEN THEY DIED.AS TO LYDGATE HIMSELF HAVING BEEN ACCEPTED HE WAS PREPARED TO ACCEPTALL THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO FORESEE WITH PERFECTCLEARNESS. OF COURSE HE MUST BE MARRIED IN A YEARPERHAPS EVEN IN HALFA YEAR. THIS WAS NOT WHAT HE HAD INTENDED BUT OTHER SCHEMES WOULD NOTBE HINDERED THEY WOULD SIMPLY ADJUST THEMSELVES ANEW. MARRIAGE OFCOURSE MUST BE PREPARED FOR IN THE USUAL WAY. A HOUSE MUST BE TAKENINSTEAD OF THE ROOMS HE AT PRESENT OCCUPIED AND LYDGATE HAVING HEARDROSAMOND SPEAK WITH ADMIRATION OF OLD MRS. BRETTONS HOUSE SITUATED INLOWICK GATE TOOK NOTICE WHEN IT FELL VACANT AFTER THE OLD LADYSDEATH AND IMMEDIATELY ENTERED INTO TREATY FOR IT.HE DID THIS IN AN EPISODIC WAY VERY MUCH AS HE GAVE ORDERS TO HISTAILOR FOR EVERY REQUISITE OF PERFECT DRESS WITHOUT ANY NOTION OFBEING EXTRAVAGANT. ON THE CONTRARY HE WOULD HAVE DESPISED ANYOSTENTATION OF EXPENSE HIS PROFESSION HAD FAMILIARIZED HIM WITH ALLGRADES OF POVERTY AND HE CARED MUCH FOR THOSE WHO SUFFERED HARDSHIPS.HE WOULD HAVE BEHAVED PERFECTLY AT A TABLE WHERE THE SAUCE WAS SERVEDIN A JUG WITH THE HANDLE OFF AND HE WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED NOTHINGABOUT A GRAND DINNER EXCEPT THAT A MAN WAS THERE WHO TALKED WELL. BUTIT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD LIVE IN ANY OTHER THAN WHATHE WOULD HAVE CALLED AN ORDINARY WAY WITH GREEN GLASSES FOR HOCK ANDEXCELLENT WAITING AT TABLE. IN WARMING HIMSELF AT FRENCH SOCIALTHEORIES HE HAD BROUGHT AWAY NO SMELL OF SCORCHING. WE MAY HANDLE EVENEXTREME OPINIONS WITH IMPUNITY WHILE OUR FURNITURE OUR DINNERGIVINGAND PREFERENCE FOR ARMORIAL BEARINGS IN OUR OWN CASE LINK USINDISSOLUBLY WITH THE ESTABLISHED ORDER. AND LYDGATES TENDENCY WAS NOTTOWARDS EXTREME OPINIONS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED NO BAREFOOTED DOCTRINESBEING PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS BOOTS HE WAS NO RADICAL IN RELATION TOANYTHING BUT MEDICAL REFORM AND THE PROSECUTION OF DISCOVERY. IN THEREST OF PRACTICAL LIFE HE WALKED BY HEREDITARY HABIT HALF FROM THATPERSONAL PRIDE AND UNREFLECTING EGOISM WHICH I HAVE ALREADY CALLEDCOMMONNESS AND HALF FROM THAT NAIVETE WHICH BELONGED TO PREOCCUPATIONWITH FAVORITE IDEAS.ANY INWARD DEBATE LYDGATE HAD AS TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS ENGAGEMENTWHICH HAD STOLEN UPON HIM TURNED ON THE PAUCITY OF TIME RATHER THAN OFMONEY. CERTAINLY BEING IN LOVE AND BEING EXPECTED CONTINUALLY BY SOMEONE WHO ALWAYS TURNED OUT TO BE PRETTIER THAN MEMORY COULD REPRESENTHER TO BE DID INTERFERE WITH THE DILIGENT USE OF SPARE HOURS WHICHMIGHT SERVE SOME PLODDING FELLOW OF A GERMAN TO MAKE THE GREATIMMINENT DISCOVERY. THIS WAS REALLY AN ARGUMENT FOR NOT DEFERRING THEMARRIAGE TOO LONG AS HE IMPLIED TO MR. FAREBROTHER ONE DAY THAT THEVICAR CAME TO HIS ROOM WITH SOME PONDPRODUCTS WHICH HE WANTED TOEXAMINE UNDER A BETTER MICROSCOPE THAN HIS OWN AND FINDING LYDGATESTABLEFUL OF APPARATUS AND SPECIMENS IN CONFUSION SAID SARCASTICALLYEROS HAS DEGENERATED HE BEGAN BY INTRODUCING ORDER AND HARMONY ANDNOW HE BRINGS BACK CHAOS.YES AT SOME STAGES SAID LYDGATE LIFTING HIS BROWS AND SMILINGWHILE HE BEGAN TO ARRANGE HIS MICROSCOPE. BUT A BETTER ORDER WILLBEGIN AFTER.SOON SAID THE VICAR.I HOPE SO REALLY. THIS UNSETTLED STATE OF AFFAIRS USES UP THE TIMEAND WHEN ONE HAS NOTIONS IN SCIENCE EVERY MOMENT IS AN OPPORTUNITY. IFEEL SURE THAT MARRIAGE MUST BE THE BEST THING FOR A MAN WHO WANTS TOWORK STEADILY. HE HAS EVERYTHING AT HOME THENNO TEASING WITH PERSONALSPECULATIONSHE CAN GET CALMNESS AND FREEDOM.YOU ARE AN ENVIABLE DOG SAID THE VICAR TO HAVE SUCH APROSPECTROSAMOND CALMNESS AND FREEDOM ALL TO YOUR SHARE. HERE AM IWITH NOTHING BUT MY PIPE AND PONDANIMALCULES. NOW ARE YOU READYLYDGATE DID NOT MENTION TO THE VICAR ANOTHER REASON HE HAD FOR WISHINGTO SHORTEN THE PERIOD OF COURTSHIP. IT WAS RATHER IRRITATING TO HIMEVEN WITH THE WINE OF LOVE IN HIS VEINS TO BE OBLIGED TO MINGLE SOOFTEN WITH THE FAMILY PARTY AT THE VINCYS AND TO ENTER SO MUCH INTOMIDDLEMARCH GOSSIP PROTRACTED GOOD CHEER WHISTPLAYING AND GENERALFUTILITY. HE HAD TO BE DEFERENTIAL WHEN MR. VINCY DECIDED QUESTIONSWITH TRENCHANT IGNORANCE ESPECIALLY AS TO THOSE LIQUORS WHICH WERE THEBEST INWARD PICKLE PRESERVING YOU FROM THE EFFECTS OF BAD AIR. MRS.VINCYS OPENNESS AND SIMPLICITY WERE QUITE UNSTREAKED WITH SUSPICION ASTO THE SUBTLE OFFENCE SHE MIGHT GIVE TO THE TASTE OF HER INTENDEDSONINLAW AND ALTOGETHER LYDGATE HAD TO CONFESS TO HIMSELF THAT HEWAS DESCENDING A LITTLE IN RELATION TO ROSAMONDS FAMILY. BUT THATEXQUISITE CREATURE HERSELF SUFFERED IN THE SAME SORT OF WAYIT WAS ATLEAST ONE DELIGHTFUL THOUGHT THAT IN MARRYING HER HE COULD GIVE HER AMUCHNEEDED TRANSPLANTATION.DEAR HE SAID TO HER ONE EVENING IN HIS GENTLEST TONE AS HE SATDOWN BY HER AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT HER FACEBUT I MUST FIRST SAY THAT HE HAD FOUND HER ALONE IN THE DRAWINGROOMWHERE THE GREAT OLDFASHIONED WINDOW ALMOST AS LARGE AS THE SIDE OFTHE ROOM WAS OPENED TO THE SUMMER SCENTS OF THE GARDEN AT THE BACK OFTHE HOUSE. HER FATHER AND MOTHER WERE GONE TO A PARTY AND THE RESTWERE ALL OUT WITH THE BUTTERFLIES.DEAR YOUR EYELIDS ARE RED.ARE THEY SAID ROSAMOND. I WONDER WHY. IT WAS NOT IN HER NATURE TOPOUR FORTH WISHES OR GRIEVANCES. THEY ONLY CAME FORTH GRACEFULLY ONSOLICITATION.AS IF YOU COULD HIDE IT FROM ME SAID LYDGATE LAYING HIS HANDTENDERLY ON BOTH OF HERS. DONT I SEE A TINY DROP ON ONE OF THELASHES THINGS TROUBLE YOU AND YOU DONT TELL ME. THAT IS UNLOVING.WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU WHAT YOU CANNOT ALTER THEY ARE EVERYDAYTHINGSPERHAPS THEY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE WORSE LATELY.FAMILY ANNOYANCES. DONT FEAR SPEAKING. I GUESS THEM.PAPA HAS BEEN MORE IRRITABLE LATELY. FRED MAKES HIM ANGRY AND THISMORNING THERE WAS A FRESH QUARREL BECAUSE FRED THREATENS TO THROW HISWHOLE EDUCATION AWAY AND DO SOMETHING QUITE BENEATH HIM. AND BESIDESROSAMOND HESITATED AND HER CHEEKS WERE GATHERING A SLIGHT FLUSH.LYDGATE HAD NEVER SEEN HER IN TROUBLE SINCE THE MORNING OF THEIRENGAGEMENT AND HE HAD NEVER FELT SO PASSIONATELY TOWARDS HER AS ATTHIS MOMENT. HE KISSED THE HESITATING LIPS GENTLY AS IF TO ENCOURAGETHEM.I FEEL THAT PAPA IS NOT QUITE PLEASED ABOUT OUR ENGAGEMENT ROSAMONDCONTINUED ALMOST IN A WHISPER AND HE SAID LAST NIGHT THAT HE SHOULDCERTAINLY SPEAK TO YOU AND SAY IT MUST BE GIVEN UP.WILL YOU GIVE IT UP SAID LYDGATE WITH QUICK ENERGYALMOST ANGRILY.I NEVER GIVE UP ANYTHING THAT I CHOOSE TO DO SAID ROSAMONDRECOVERING HER CALMNESS AT THE TOUCHING OF THIS CHORD.GOD BLESS YOU SAID LYDGATE KISSING HER AGAIN. THIS CONSTANCY OFPURPOSE IN THE RIGHT PLACE WAS ADORABLE. HE WENT ONIT IS TOO LATE NOW FOR YOUR FATHER TO SAY THAT OUR ENGAGEMENT MUST BEGIVEN UP. YOU ARE OF AGE AND I CLAIM YOU AS MINE. IF ANYTHING IS DONETO MAKE YOU UNHAPPYTHAT IS A REASON FOR HASTENING OUR MARRIAGE.AN UNMISTAKABLE DELIGHT SHONE FORTH FROM THE BLUE EYES THAT MET HISAND THE RADIANCE SEEMED TO LIGHT UP ALL HIS FUTURE WITH MILD SUNSHINE.IDEAL HAPPINESS OF THE KIND KNOWN IN THE ARABIAN NIGHTS IN WHICH YOUARE INVITED TO STEP FROM THE LABOR AND DISCORD OF THE STREET INTO APARADISE WHERE EVERYTHING IS GIVEN TO YOU AND NOTHING CLAIMED SEEMEDTO BE AN AFFAIR OF A FEW WEEKS WAITING MORE OR LESS.WHY SHOULD WE DEFER IT HE SAID WITH ARDENT INSISTENCE. I HAVETAKEN THE HOUSE NOW EVERYTHING ELSE CAN SOON BE GOT READYCAN IT NOTYOU WILL NOT MIND ABOUT NEW CLOTHES. THOSE CAN BE BOUGHT AFTERWARDS.WHAT ORIGINAL NOTIONS YOU CLEVER MEN HAVE SAID ROSAMOND DIMPLINGWITH MORE THOROUGH LAUGHTER THAN USUAL AT THIS HUMOROUS INCONGRUITY.THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I EVER HEARD OF WEDDINGCLOTHES BEING BOUGHTAFTER MARRIAGE.BUT YOU DONT MEAN TO SAY YOU WOULD INSIST ON MY WAITING MONTHS FORTHE SAKE OF CLOTHES SAID LYDGATE HALF THINKING THAT ROSAMOND WASTORMENTING HIM PRETTILY AND HALF FEARING THAT SHE REALLY SHRANK FROMSPEEDY MARRIAGE. REMEMBER WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO A BETTER SORT OFHAPPINESS EVEN THAN THISBEING CONTINUALLY TOGETHER INDEPENDENT OFOTHERS AND ORDERING OUR LIVES AS WE WILL. COME DEAR TELL ME HOW SOONYOU CAN BE ALTOGETHER MINE.THERE WAS A SERIOUS PLEADING IN LYDGATES TONE AS IF HE FELT THAT SHEWOULD BE INJURING HIM BY ANY FANTASTIC DELAYS. ROSAMOND BECAME SERIOUSTOO AND SLIGHTLY MEDITATIVE IN FACT SHE WAS GOING THROUGH MANYINTRICACIES OF LACEEDGING AND HOSIERY AND PETTICOATTUCKING IN ORDERTO GIVE AN ANSWER THAT WOULD AT LEAST BE APPROXIMATIVE.SIX WEEKS WOULD BE AMPLESAY SO ROSAMOND INSISTED LYDGATERELEASING HER HANDS TO PUT HIS ARM GENTLY ROUND HER.ONE LITTLE HAND IMMEDIATELY WENT TO PAT HER HAIR WHILE SHE GAVE HERNECK A MEDITATIVE TURN AND THEN SAID SERIOUSLYTHERE WOULD BE THE HOUSELINEN AND THE FURNITURE TO BE PREPARED.STILL MAMMA COULD SEE TO THOSE WHILE WE WERE AWAY.YES TO BE SURE. WE MUST BE AWAY A WEEK OR SO.OH MORE THAN THAT SAID ROSAMOND EARNESTLY. SHE WAS THINKING OF HEREVENING DRESSES FOR THE VISIT TO SIR GODWIN LYDGATES WHICH SHE HADLONG BEEN SECRETLY HOPING FOR AS A DELIGHTFUL EMPLOYMENT OF AT LEASTONE QUARTER OF THE HONEYMOON EVEN IF SHE DEFERRED HER INTRODUCTION TOTHE UNCLE WHO WAS A DOCTOR OF DIVINITY ALSO A PLEASING THOUGH SOBERKIND OF RANK WHEN SUSTAINED BY BLOOD. SHE LOOKED AT HER LOVER WITHSOME WONDERING REMONSTRANCE AS SHE SPOKE AND HE READILY UNDERSTOODTHAT SHE MIGHT WISH TO LENGTHEN THE SWEET TIME OF DOUBLE SOLITUDE.WHATEVER YOU WISH MY DARLING WHEN THE DAY IS FIXED. BUT LET US TAKEA DECIDED COURSE AND PUT AN END TO ANY DISCOMFORT YOU MAY BESUFFERING. SIX WEEKSI AM SURE THEY WOULD BE AMPLE.I COULD CERTAINLY HASTEN THE WORK SAID ROSAMOND. WILL YOU THENMENTION IT TO PAPAI THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WRITE TO HIM. SHEBLUSHED AND LOOKED AT HIM AS THE GARDEN FLOWERS LOOK AT US WHEN WE WALKFORTH HAPPILY AMONG THEM IN THE TRANSCENDENT EVENING LIGHT IS THERENOT A SOUL BEYOND UTTERANCE HALF NYMPH HALF CHILD IN THOSE DELICATEPETALS WHICH GLOW AND BREATHE ABOUT THE CENTRES OF DEEP COLORHE TOUCHED HER EAR AND A LITTLE BIT OF NECK UNDER IT WITH HIS LIPS ANDTHEY SAT QUITE STILL FOR MANY MINUTES WHICH FLOWED BY THEM LIKE A SMALLGURGLING BROOK WITH THE KISSES OF THE SUN UPON IT. ROSAMOND THOUGHTTHAT NO ONE COULD BE MORE IN LOVE THAN SHE WAS AND LYDGATE THOUGHTTHAT AFTER ALL HIS WILD MISTAKES AND ABSURD CREDULITY HE HAD FOUNDPERFECT WOMANHOODFELT AS IF ALREADY BREATHED UPON BY EXQUISITE WEDDEDAFFECTION SUCH AS WOULD BE BESTOWED BY AN ACCOMPLISHED CREATURE WHOVENERATED HIS HIGH MUSINGS AND MOMENTOUS LABORS AND WOULD NEVERINTERFERE WITH THEM WHO WOULD CREATE ORDER IN THE HOME AND ACCOUNTSWITH STILL MAGIC YET KEEP HER FINGERS READY TO TOUCH THE LUTE ANDTRANSFORM LIFE INTO ROMANCE AT ANY MOMENT WHO WAS INSTRUCTED TO THETRUE WOMANLY LIMIT AND NOT A HAIRSBREADTH BEYONDDOCILE THEREFOREAND READY TO CARRY OUT BEHESTS WHICH CAME FROM THAT LIMIT. IT WASPLAINER NOW THAN EVER THAT HIS NOTION OF REMAINING MUCH LONGER ABACHELOR HAD BEEN A MISTAKE MARRIAGE WOULD NOT BE AN OBSTRUCTION BUT AFURTHERANCE. AND HAPPENING THE NEXT DAY TO ACCOMPANY A PATIENT TOBRASSING HE SAW A DINNERSERVICE THERE WHICH STRUCK HIM AS SO EXACTLYTHE RIGHT THING THAT HE BOUGHT IT AT ONCE. IT SAVED TIME TO DO THESETHINGS JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT OF THEM AND LYDGATE HATED UGLY CROCKERY.THE DINNERSERVICE IN QUESTION WAS EXPENSIVE BUT THAT MIGHT BE IN THENATURE OF DINNERSERVICES. FURNISHING WAS NECESSARILY EXPENSIVE BUTTHEN IT HAD TO BE DONE ONLY ONCE.IT MUST BE LOVELY SAID MRS. VINCY WHEN LYDGATE MENTIONED HISPURCHASE WITH SOME DESCRIPTIVE TOUCHES. JUST WHAT ROSY OUGHT TO HAVE.I TRUST IN HEAVEN IT WONT BE BROKENONE MUST HIRE SERVANTS WHO WILL NOT BREAK THINGS SAID LYDGATE.CERTAINLY THIS WAS REASONING WITH AN IMPERFECT VISION OF SEQUENCES.BUT AT THAT PERIOD THERE WAS NO SORT OF REASONING WHICH WAS NOT MORE ORLESS SANCTIONED BY MEN OF SCIENCE.OF COURSE IT WAS UNNECESSARY TO DEFER THE MENTION OF ANYTHING TO MAMMAWHO DID NOT READILY TAKE VIEWS THAT WERE NOT CHEERFUL AND BEING AHAPPY WIFE HERSELF HAD HARDLY ANY FEELING BUT PRIDE IN HER DAUGHTERSMARRIAGE. BUT ROSAMOND HAD GOOD REASONS FOR SUGGESTING TO LYDGATE THATPAPA SHOULD BE APPEALED TO IN WRITING. SHE PREPARED FOR THE ARRIVAL OFTHE LETTER BY WALKING WITH HER PAPA TO THE WAREHOUSE THE NEXT MORNINGAND TELLING HIM ON THE WAY THAT MR. LYDGATE WISHED TO BE MARRIED SOON.NONSENSE MY DEAR SAID MR. VINCY. WHAT HAS HE GOT TO MARRY ONYOUD MUCH BETTER GIVE UP THE ENGAGEMENT. IVE TOLD YOU SO PRETTYPLAINLY BEFORE THIS. WHAT HAVE YOU HAD SUCH AN EDUCATION FOR IF YOUARE TO GO AND MARRY A POOR MAN ITS A CRUEL THING FOR A FATHER TOSEE.MR. LYDGATE IS NOT POOR PAPA. HE BOUGHT MR. PEACOCKS PRACTICEWHICH THEY SAY IS WORTH EIGHT OR NINE HUNDRED AYEAR.STUFF AND NONSENSE WHATS BUYING A PRACTICE HE MIGHT AS WELL BUYNEXT YEARS SWALLOWS. ITLL ALL SLIP THROUGH HIS FINGERS.ON THE CONTRARY PAPA HE WILL INCREASE THE PRACTICE. SEE HOW HE HASBEEN CALLED IN BY THE CHETTAMS AND CASAUBONS.I HOPE HE KNOWS I SHANT GIVE ANYTHINGWITH THIS DISAPPOINTMENT ABOUTFRED AND PARLIAMENT GOING TO BE DISSOLVED AND MACHINEBREAKINGEVERYWHERE AND AN ELECTION COMING ONDEAR PAPA WHAT CAN THAT HAVE TO DO WITH MY MARRIAGEA PRETTY DEAL TO DO WITH IT WE MAY ALL BE RUINED FOR WHAT I KNOWTHECOUNTRYS IN THAT STATE SOME SAY ITS THE END OF THE WORLD AND BEHANGED IF I DONT THINK IT LOOKS LIKE IT ANYHOW ITS NOT A TIME FORME TO BE DRAWING MONEY OUT OF MY BUSINESS AND I SHOULD WISH LYDGATE TOKNOW THAT.I AM SURE HE EXPECTS NOTHING PAPA. AND HE HAS SUCH VERY HIGHCONNECTIONS HE IS SURE TO RISE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. HE IS ENGAGED INMAKING SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES.MR. VINCY WAS SILENT.I CANNOT GIVE UP MY ONLY PROSPECT OF HAPPINESS PAPA. MR. LYDGATE IS AGENTLEMAN. I COULD NEVER LOVE ANY ONE WHO WAS NOT A PERFECT GENTLEMAN.YOU WOULD NOT LIKE ME TO GO INTO A CONSUMPTION AS ARABELLA HAWLEY DID.AND YOU KNOW THAT I NEVER CHANGE MY MIND.AGAIN PAPA WAS SILENT.PROMISE ME PAPA THAT YOU WILL CONSENT TO WHAT WE WISH. WE SHALLNEVER GIVE EACH OTHER UP AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS OBJECTED TOLONG COURTSHIPS AND LATE MARRIAGES.THERE WAS A LITTLE MORE URGENCY OF THIS KIND TILL MR. VINCY SAIDWELL WELL CHILD HE MUST WRITE TO ME FIRST BEFORE I CAN ANSWERHIMAND ROSAMOND WAS CERTAIN THAT SHE HAD GAINED HER POINT.MR. VINCYS ANSWER CONSISTED CHIEFLY IN A DEMAND THAT LYDGATE SHOULDINSURE HIS LIFEA DEMAND IMMEDIATELY CONCEDED. THIS WAS A DELIGHTFULLYREASSURING IDEA SUPPOSING THAT LYDGATE DIED BUT IN THE MEAN TIME NOT ASELFSUPPORTING IDEA. HOWEVER IT SEEMED TO MAKE EVERYTHING COMFORTABLEABOUT ROSAMONDS MARRIAGE AND THE NECESSARY PURCHASES WENT ON WITHMUCH SPIRIT. NOT WITHOUT PRUDENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS HOWEVER. A BRIDEWHO IS GOING TO VISIT AT A BARONETS MUST HAVE A FEW FIRSTRATEPOCKETHANDKERCHIEFS BUT BEYOND THE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY HALFDOZENROSAMOND CONTENTED HERSELF WITHOUT THE VERY HIGHEST STYLE OF EMBROIDERYAND VALENCIENNES. LYDGATE ALSO FINDING THAT HIS SUM OF EIGHT HUNDREDPOUNDS HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLY REDUCED SINCE HE HAD COME TO MIDDLEMARCHRESTRAINED HIS INCLINATION FOR SOME PLATE OF AN OLD PATTERN WHICH WASSHOWN TO HIM WHEN HE WENT INTO KIBBLES ESTABLISHMENT AT BRASSING TOBUY FORKS AND SPOONS. HE WAS TOO PROUD TO ACT AS IF HE PRESUPPOSED THATMR. VINCY WOULD ADVANCE MONEY TO PROVIDE FURNITURE AND THOUGH SINCEIT WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING AT ONCE SOME BILLSWOULD BE LEFT STANDING OVER HE DID NOT WASTE TIME IN CONJECTURING HOWMUCH HIS FATHERINLAW WOULD GIVE IN THE FORM OF DOWRY TO MAKE PAYMENTEASY. HE WAS NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING EXTRAVAGANT BUT THE REQUISITETHINGS MUST BE BOUGHT AND IT WOULD BE BAD ECONOMY TO BUY THEM OF APOOR QUALITY. ALL THESE MATTERS WERE BY THE BYE. LYDGATE FORESAW THATSCIENCE AND HIS PROFESSION WERE THE OBJECTS HE SHOULD ALONE PURSUEENTHUSIASTICALLY BUT HE COULD NOT IMAGINE HIMSELF PURSUING THEM INSUCH A HOME AS WRENCH HADTHE DOORS ALL OPEN THE OILCLOTH WORN THECHILDREN IN SOILED PINAFORES AND LUNCH LINGERING IN THE FORM OF BONESBLACKHANDLED KNIVES AND WILLOWPATTERN. BUT WRENCH HAD A WRETCHEDLYMPHATIC WIFE WHO MADE A MUMMY OF HERSELF INDOORS IN A LARGE SHAWLAND HE MUST HAVE ALTOGETHER BEGUN WITH AN ILLCHOSEN DOMESTICAPPARATUS.ROSAMOND HOWEVER WAS ON HER SIDE MUCH OCCUPIED WITH CONJECTURESTHOUGH HER QUICK IMITATIVE PERCEPTION WARNED HER AGAINST BETRAYING THEMTOO CRUDELY.I SHALL LIKE SO MUCH TO KNOW YOUR FAMILY SHE SAID ONE DAY WHEN THEWEDDING JOURNEY WAS BEING DISCUSSED. WE MIGHT PERHAPS TAKE A DIRECTIONTHAT WOULD ALLOW US TO SEE THEM AS WE RETURNED. WHICH OF YOUR UNCLES DOYOU LIKE BESTOHMY UNCLE GODWIN I THINK. HE IS A GOODNATURED OLD FELLOW.YOU WERE CONSTANTLY AT HIS HOUSE AT QUALLINGHAM WHEN YOU WERE A BOYWERE YOU NOT I SHOULD SO LIKE TO SEE THE OLD SPOT AND EVERYTHING YOUWERE USED TO. DOES HE KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO BE MARRIEDNO SAID LYDGATE CARELESSLY TURNING IN HIS CHAIR AND RUBBING HISHAIR UP.DO SEND HIM WORD OF IT YOU NAUGHTY UNDUTIFUL NEPHEW. HE WILL PERHAPSASK YOU TO TAKE ME TO QUALLINGHAM AND THEN YOU COULD SHOW ME ABOUT THEGROUNDS AND I COULD IMAGINE YOU THERE WHEN YOU WERE A BOY. REMEMBERYOU SEE ME IN MY HOME JUST AS IT HAS BEEN SINCE I WAS A CHILD. IT ISNOT FAIR THAT I SHOULD BE SO IGNORANT OF YOURS. BUT PERHAPS YOU WOULDBE A LITTLE ASHAMED OF ME. I FORGOT THAT.LYDGATE SMILED AT HER TENDERLY AND REALLY ACCEPTED THE SUGGESTION THATTHE PROUD PLEASURE OF SHOWING SO CHARMING A BRIDE WAS WORTH SOMETROUBLE. AND NOW HE CAME TO THINK OF IT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE OLDSPOTS WITH ROSAMOND.I WILL WRITE TO HIM THEN. BUT MY COUSINS ARE BORES.IT SEEMED MAGNIFICENT TO ROSAMOND TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK SO SLIGHTINGLY OFA BARONETS FAMILY AND SHE FELT MUCH CONTENTMENT IN THE PROSPECT OFBEING ABLE TO ESTIMATE THEM CONTEMPTUOUSLY ON HER OWN ACCOUNT.BUT MAMMA WAS NEAR SPOILING ALL A DAY OR TWO LATER BY SAYINGI HOPE YOUR UNCLE SIR GODWIN WILL NOT LOOK DOWN ON ROSY MR. LYDGATE.I SHOULD THINK HE WOULD DO SOMETHING HANDSOME. A THOUSAND OR TWO CAN BENOTHING TO A BARONET.MAMMA SAID ROSAMOND BLUSHING DEEPLY AND LYDGATE PITIED HER SO MUCHTHAT HE REMAINED SILENT AND WENT TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM TOEXAMINE A PRINT CURIOUSLY AS IF HE HAD BEEN ABSENTMINDED. MAMMA HAD ALITTLE FILIAL LECTURE AFTERWARDS AND WAS DOCILE AS USUAL. BUT ROSAMONDREFLECTED THAT IF ANY OF THOSE HIGHBRED COUSINS WHO WERE BORES SHOULDBE INDUCED TO VISIT MIDDLEMARCH THEY WOULD SEE MANY THINGS IN HER OWNFAMILY WHICH MIGHT SHOCK THEM. HENCE IT SEEMED DESIRABLE THAT LYDGATESHOULD BYANDBY GET SOME FIRSTRATE POSITION ELSEWHERE THAN INMIDDLEMARCH AND THIS COULD HARDLY BE DIFFICULT IN THE CASE OF A MANWHO HAD A TITLED UNCLE AND COULD MAKE DISCOVERIES. LYDGATE YOUPERCEIVE HAD TALKED FERVIDLY TO ROSAMOND OF HIS HOPES AS TO THEHIGHEST USES OF HIS LIFE AND HAD FOUND IT DELIGHTFUL TO BE LISTENED TOBY A CREATURE WHO WOULD BRING HIM THE SWEET FURTHERANCE OF SATISFYINGAFFECTIONBEAUTYREPOSESUCH HELP AS OUR THOUGHTS GET FROM THE SUMMERSKY AND THE FLOWERFRINGED MEADOWS.LYDGATE RELIED MUCH ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT FORTHE SAKE OF VARIETY I WILL CALL GOOSE AND GANDER ESPECIALLY ON THEINNATE SUBMISSIVENESS OF THE GOOSE AS BEAUTIFULLY CORRESPONDING TO THESTRENGTH OF THE GANDER.CHAPTER XXXVII.THRICE HAPPY SHE THAT IS SO WELL ASSUREDUNTO HERSELF AND SETTLED SO IN HEARTTHAT NEITHER WILL FOR BETTER BE ALLUREDNE FEARS TO WORSE WITH ANY CHANCE TO STARTBUT LIKE A STEDDY SHIP DOTH STRONGLY PARTTHE RAGING WAVES AND KEEPS HER COURSE ARIGHTNE AUGHT FOR TEMPEST DOTH FROM IT DEPARTNE AUGHT FOR FAIRER WEATHERS FALSE DELIGHT.SUCH SELFASSURANCE NEED NOT FEAR THE SPIGHTOF GRUDGING FOES NE FAVOUR SEEK OF FRIENDSBUT IN THE STAY OF HER OWN STEDFAST MIGHTNEITHER TO ONE HERSELF NOR OTHER BENDS.

HACKBUTT WHOSE FLUENT SPEECH WAS AT THAT TIME FLOATING MORE WIDELYTHAN USUAL AND LEAVING MUCH UNCERTAINTY AS TO ITS ULTIMATE CHANNELWAS HEARD TO SAY IN MR. HAWLEYS OFFICE THAT THE ARTICLE IN QUESTIONEMANATED FROM BROOKE OF TIPTON AND THAT BROOKE HAD SECRETLY BOUGHTTHE PIONEER SOME MONTHS AGO.THAT MEANS MISCHIEF EH SAID MR. HAWLEY. HES GOT THE FREAK OFBEING A POPULAR MAN NOW AFTER DANGLING ABOUT LIKE A STRAY TORTOISE. SOMUCH THE WORSE FOR HIM. IVE HAD MY EYE ON HIM FOR SOME TIME. HE SHALLBE PRETTILY PUMPED UPON. HES A DAMNED BAD LANDLORD. WHAT BUSINESS HASAN OLD COUNTY MAN TO COME CURRYING FAVOR WITH A LOW SET OF DARKBLUEFREEMEN AS TO HIS PAPER I ONLY HOPE HE MAY DO THE WRITING HIMSELF. ITWOULD BE WORTH OUR PAYING FOR.I UNDERSTAND HE HAS GOT A VERY BRILLIANT YOUNG FELLOW TO EDIT IT WHOCAN WRITE THE HIGHEST STYLE OF LEADING ARTICLE QUITE EQUAL TO ANYTHINGIN THE LONDON PAPERS. AND HE MEANS TO TAKE VERY HIGH GROUND ON REFORM.LET BROOKE REFORM HIS RENTROLL. HES A CURSED OLD SCREW AND THEBUILDINGS ALL OVER HIS ESTATE ARE GOING TO RACK. I SUPPOSE THIS YOUNGFELLOW IS SOME LOOSE FISH FROM LONDON.HIS NAME IS LADISLAW. HE IS SAID TO BE OF FOREIGN EXTRACTION.I KNOW THE SORT SAID MR. HAWLEY SOME EMISSARY. HELL BEGIN WITHFLOURISHING ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF MAN AND END WITH MURDERING A WENCH.THATS THE STYLE.YOU MUST CONCEDE THAT THERE ARE ABUSES HAWLEY SAID MR.

IMYSELF SHOULD NEVER FAVOR IMMODERATE VIEWSIN FACT I TAKE MY STAND WITHHUSKISSONBUT I CANNOT BLIND MYSELF TO THE CONSIDERATION THAT THENONREPRESENTATION OF LARGE TOWNSLARGE TOWNS BE DAMNED SAID MR. HAWLEY IMPATIENT OF EXPOSITION. IKNOW A LITTLE TOO MUCH ABOUT MIDDLEMARCH ELECTIONS. LET EM QUASH EVERYPOCKET BOROUGH TOMORROW AND BRING IN EVERY MUSHROOM TOWN IN THEKINGDOMTHEYLL ONLY INCREASE THE EXPENSE OF GETTING INTO PARLIAMENT. IGO UPON FACTS.MR. HAWLEYS DISGUST AT THE NOTION OF THE PIONEER BEING EDITED BY ANEMISSARY AND OF BROOKE BECOMING ACTIVELY POLITICALAS IF A TORTOISE OFDESULTORY PURSUITS SHOULD PROTRUDE ITS SMALL HEAD AMBITIOUSLY ANDBECOME RAMPANTWAS HARDLY EQUAL TO THE ANNOYANCE FELT BY SOME MEMBERSOF MR. BROOKES OWN FAMILY. THE RESULT HAD OOZED FORTH GRADUALLY LIKETHE DISCOVERY THAT YOUR NEIGHBOR HAS SET UP AN UNPLEASANT KIND OFMANUFACTURE WHICH WILL BE PERMANENTLY UNDER YOUR NOSTRILS WITHOUT LEGALREMEDY. THE PIONEER HAD BEEN SECRETLY BOUGHT EVEN BEFORE WILLLADISLAWS ARRIVAL THE EXPECTED OPPORTUNITY HAVING OFFERED ITSELF INTHE READINESS OF THE PROPRIETOR TO PART WITH A VALUABLE PROPERTY WHICHDID NOT PAY AND IN THE INTERVAL SINCE MR. BROOKE HAD WRITTEN HISINVITATION THOSE GERMINAL IDEAS OF MAKING HIS MIND TELL UPON THE WORLDAT LARGE WHICH HAD BEEN PRESENT IN HIM FROM HIS YOUNGER YEARS BUT HADHITHERTO LAIN IN SOME OBSTRUCTION HAD BEEN SPROUTING UNDER COVER.THE DEVELOPMENT WAS MUCH FURTHERED BY A DELIGHT IN HIS GUEST WHICHPROVED GREATER EVEN THAN HE HAD ANTICIPATED. FOR IT SEEMED THAT WILLWAS NOT ONLY AT HOME IN ALL THOSE ARTISTIC AND LITERARY SUBJECTS WHICHMR. BROOKE HAD GONE INTO AT ONE TIME BUT THAT HE WAS STRIKINGLY READYAT SEIZING THE POINTS OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION AND DEALING WITH THEMIN THAT LARGE SPIRIT WHICH AIDED BY ADEQUATE MEMORY LENDS ITSELF TOQUOTATION AND GENERAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TREATMENT.HE SEEMS TO ME A KIND OF SHELLEY YOU KNOW MR. BROOKE TOOK ANOPPORTUNITY OF SAYING FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF MR. CASAUBON. I DONTMEAN AS TO ANYTHING OBJECTIONABLELAXITIES OR ATHEISM OR ANYTHING OFTHAT KIND YOU KNOWLADISLAWS SENTIMENTS IN EVERY WAY I AM SURE AREGOODINDEED WE WERE TALKING A GREAT DEAL TOGETHER LAST NIGHT. BUT HEHAS THE SAME SORT OF ENTHUSIASM FOR LIBERTY FREEDOM EMANCIPATIONAFINE THING UNDER GUIDANCEUNDER GUIDANCE YOU KNOW. I THINK I SHALL BEABLE TO PUT HIM ON THE RIGHT TACK AND I AM THE MORE PLEASED BECAUSE HEIS A RELATION OF YOURS CASAUBON.IF THE RIGHT TACK IMPLIED ANYTHING MORE PRECISE THAN THE REST OF MR.BROOKES SPEECH MR. CASAUBON SILENTLY HOPED THAT IT REFERRED TO SOMEOCCUPATION AT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM LOWICK. HE HAD DISLIKED WILL WHILEHE HELPED HIM BUT HE HAD BEGUN TO DISLIKE HIM STILL MORE NOW THAT WILLHAD DECLINED HIS HELP. THAT IS THE WAY WITH US WHEN WE HAVE ANY UNEASYJEALOUSY IN OUR DISPOSITION IF OUR TALENTS ARE CHIEFLY OF THEBURROWING KIND OUR HONEYSIPPING COUSIN WHOM WE HAVE GRAVE REASONSFOR OBJECTING TO IS LIKELY TO HAVE A SECRET CONTEMPT FOR US AND ANYONE WHO ADMIRES HIM PASSES AN OBLIQUE CRITICISM ON OURSELVES. HAVINGTHE SCRUPLES OF RECTITUDE IN OUR SOULS WE ARE ABOVE THE MEANNESS OFINJURING HIMRATHER WE MEET ALL HIS CLAIMS ON US BY ACTIVE BENEFITSAND THE DRAWING OF CHEQUES FOR HIM BEING A SUPERIORITY WHICH HE MUSTRECOGNIZE GIVES OUR BITTERNESS A MILDER INFUSION. NOW MR. CASAUBON HADBEEN DEPRIVED OF THAT SUPERIORITY AS ANYTHING MORE THAN A REMEMBRANCEIN A SUDDEN CAPRICIOUS MANNER. HIS ANTIPATHY TO WILL DID NOT SPRINGFROM THE COMMON JEALOUSY OF A WINTERWORN HUSBAND IT WAS SOMETHINGDEEPER BRED BY HIS LIFELONG CLAIMS AND DISCONTENTS BUT DOROTHEA NOWTHAT SHE WAS PRESENTDOROTHEA AS A YOUNG WIFE WHO HERSELF HAD SHOWN ANOFFENSIVE CAPABILITY OF CRITICISM NECESSARILY GAVE CONCENTRATION TOTHE UNEASINESS WHICH HAD BEFORE BEEN VAGUE.WILL LADISLAW ON HIS SIDE FELT THAT HIS DISLIKE WAS FLOURISHING AT THEEXPENSE OF HIS GRATITUDE AND SPENT MUCH INWARD DISCOURSE IN JUSTIFYINGTHE DISLIKE. CASAUBON HATED HIMHE KNEW THAT VERY WELL ON HIS FIRSTENTRANCE HE COULD DISCERN A BITTERNESS IN THE MOUTH AND A VENOM IN THEGLANCE WHICH WOULD ALMOST JUSTIFY DECLARING WAR IN SPITE OF PASTBENEFITS. HE WAS MUCH OBLIGED TO CASAUBON IN THE PAST BUT REALLY THEACT OF MARRYING THIS WIFE WAS A SETOFF AGAINST THE OBLIGATION. IT WASA QUESTION WHETHER GRATITUDE WHICH REFERS TO WHAT IS DONE FOR ONESSELF OUGHT NOT TO GIVE WAY TO INDIGNATION AT WHAT IS DONE AGAINSTANOTHER. AND CASAUBON HAD DONE A WRONG TO DOROTHEA IN MARRYING HER. AMAN WAS BOUND TO KNOW HIMSELF BETTER THAN THAT AND IF HE CHOSE TO GROWGRAY CRUNCHING BONES IN A CAVERN HE HAD NO BUSINESS TO BE LURING AGIRL INTO HIS COMPANIONSHIP. IT IS THE MOST HORRIBLE OFVIRGINSACRIFICES SAID WILL AND HE PAINTED TO HIMSELF WHAT WEREDOROTHEAS INWARD SORROWS AS IF HE HAD BEEN WRITING A CHORIC WAIL. BUTHE WOULD NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF HER HE WOULD WATCH OVER HERIF HE GAVE UPEVERYTHING ELSE IN LIFE HE WOULD WATCH OVER HER AND SHE SHOULD KNOWTHAT SHE HAD ONE SLAVE IN THE WORLD. WILL HADTO USE SIR THOMASBROWNES PHRASEA PASSIONATE PRODIGALITY OF STATEMENT BOTH TO HIMSELFAND OTHERS. THE SIMPLE TRUTH WAS THAT NOTHING THEN INVITED HIM SOSTRONGLY AS THE PRESENCE OF DOROTHEA.INVITATIONS OF THE FORMAL KIND HAD BEEN WANTING HOWEVER FOR WILL HADNEVER BEEN ASKED TO GO TO LOWICK. MR. BROOKE INDEED CONFIDENT OFDOING EVERYTHING AGREEABLE WHICH CASAUBON POOR FELLOW WAS TOO MUCHABSORBED TO THINK OF HAD ARRANGED TO BRING LADISLAW TO LOWICK SEVERALTIMES NOT NEGLECTING MEANWHILE TO INTRODUCE HIM ELSEWHERE ON EVERYOPPORTUNITY AS A YOUNG RELATIVE OF CASAUBONS. AND THOUGH WILL HADNOT SEEN DOROTHEA ALONE THEIR INTERVIEWS HAD BEEN ENOUGH TO RESTOREHER FORMER SENSE OF YOUNG COMPANIONSHIP WITH ONE WHO WAS CLEVERER THANHERSELF YET SEEMED READY TO BE SWAYED BY HER. POOR DOROTHEA BEFORE HERMARRIAGE HAD NEVER FOUND MUCH ROOM IN OTHER MINDS FOR WHAT SHE CAREDMOST TO SAY AND SHE HAD NOT AS WE KNOW ENJOYED HER HUSBANDSSUPERIOR INSTRUCTION SO MUCH AS SHE HAD EXPECTED. IF SHE SPOKE WITH ANYKEENNESS OF INTEREST TO MR. CASAUBON HE HEARD HER WITH AN AIR OFPATIENCE AS IF SHE HAD GIVEN A QUOTATION FROM THE DELECTUS FAMILIAR TOHIM FROM HIS TENDER YEARS AND SOMETIMES MENTIONED CURTLY WHAT ANCIENTSECTS OR PERSONAGES HAD HELD SIMILAR IDEAS AS IF THERE WERE TOO MUCHOF THAT SORT IN STOCK ALREADY AT OTHER TIMES HE WOULD INFORM HER THATSHE WAS MISTAKEN AND REASSERT WHAT HER REMARK HAD QUESTIONED.BUT WILL LADISLAW ALWAYS SEEMED TO SEE MORE IN WHAT SHE SAID THAN SHEHERSELF SAW. DOROTHEA HAD LITTLE VANITY BUT SHE HAD THE ARDENT WOMANSNEED TO RULE BENEFICENTLY BY MAKING THE JOY OF ANOTHER SOUL. HENCE THEMERE CHANCE OF SEEING WILL OCCASIONALLY WAS LIKE A LUNETTE OPENED INTHE WALL OF HER PRISON GIVING HER A GLIMPSE OF THE SUNNY AIR AND THISPLEASURE BEGAN TO NULLIFY HER ORIGINAL ALARM AT WHAT HER HUSBAND MIGHTTHINK ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF WILL AS HER UNCLES GUEST. ON THISSUBJECT MR. CASAUBON HAD REMAINED DUMB.BUT WILL WANTED TO TALK WITH DOROTHEA ALONE AND WAS IMPATIENT OF SLOWCIRCUMSTANCE. HOWEVER SLIGHT THE TERRESTRIAL INTERCOURSE BETWEEN DANTEAND BEATRICE OR PETRARCH AND LAURA TIME CHANGES THE PROPORTION OFTHINGS AND IN LATER DAYS IT IS PREFERABLE TO HAVE FEWER SONNETS ANDMORE CONVERSATION. NECESSITY EXCUSED STRATAGEM BUT STRATAGEM WASLIMITED BY THE DREAD OF OFFENDING DOROTHEA. HE FOUND OUT AT LAST THATHE WANTED TO TAKE A PARTICULAR SKETCH AT LOWICK AND ONE MORNING WHENMR. BROOKE HAD TO DRIVE ALONG THE LOWICK ROAD ON HIS WAY TO THE COUNTYTOWN WILL ASKED TO BE SET DOWN WITH HIS SKETCHBOOK AND CAMPSTOOL ATLOWICK AND WITHOUT ANNOUNCING HIMSELF AT THE MANOR SETTLED HIMSELF TOSKETCH IN A POSITION WHERE HE MUST SEE DOROTHEA IF SHE CAME OUT TOWALKAND HE KNEW THAT SHE USUALLY WALKED AN HOUR IN THE MORNING.BUT THE STRATAGEM WAS DEFEATED BY THE WEATHER. CLOUDS GATHERED WITHTREACHEROUS QUICKNESS THE RAIN CAME DOWN AND WILL WAS OBLIGED TO TAKESHELTER IN THE HOUSE. HE INTENDED ON THE STRENGTH OF RELATIONSHIP TOGO INTO THE DRAWINGROOM AND WAIT THERE WITHOUT BEING ANNOUNCED ANDSEEING HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCE THE BUTLER IN THE HALL HE SAID DONTMENTION THAT I AM HERE PRATT I WILL WAIT TILL LUNCHEON I KNOW MR.CASAUBON DOES NOT LIKE TO BE DISTURBED WHEN HE IS IN THE LIBRARY.MASTER IS OUT SIR THERES ONLY MRS. CASAUBON IN THE LIBRARY. IDBETTER TELL HER YOURE HERE SIR SAID PRATT A REDCHEEKED MAN GIVENTO LIVELY CONVERSE WITH TANTRIPP AND OFTEN AGREEING WITH HER THAT ITMUST BE DULL FOR MADAM.OH VERY WELL THIS CONFOUNDED RAIN HAS HINDERED ME FROM SKETCHINGSAID WILL FEELING SO HAPPY THAT HE AFFECTED INDIFFERENCE WITHDELIGHTFUL EASE.IN ANOTHER MINUTE HE WAS IN THE LIBRARY AND DOROTHEA WAS MEETING HIMWITH HER SWEET UNCONSTRAINED SMILE.MR. CASAUBON HAS GONE TO THE ARCHDEACONS SHE SAID AT ONCE. IDONT KNOW WHETHER HE WILL BE AT HOME AGAIN LONG BEFORE DINNER. HE WASUNCERTAIN HOW LONG HE SHOULD BE. DID YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHINGPARTICULAR TO HIMNO I CAME TO SKETCH BUT THE RAIN DROVE ME IN. ELSE I WOULD NOT HAVEDISTURBED YOU YET. I SUPPOSED THAT MR. CASAUBON WAS HERE AND I KNOW HEDISLIKES INTERRUPTION AT THIS HOUR.I AM INDEBTED TO THE RAIN THEN. I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU. DOROTHEAUTTERED THESE COMMON WORDS WITH THE SIMPLE SINCERITY OF AN UNHAPPYCHILD VISITED AT SCHOOL.I REALLY CAME FOR THE CHANCE OF SEEING YOU ALONE SAID WILLMYSTERIOUSLY FORCED TO BE JUST AS SIMPLE AS SHE WAS. HE COULD NOT STAYTO ASK HIMSELF WHY NOT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THINGS AS WE DID INROME. IT ALWAYS MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE PRESENT.YES SAID DOROTHEA IN HER CLEAR FULL TONE OF ASSENT. SIT DOWN. SHESEATED HERSELF ON A DARK OTTOMAN WITH THE BROWN BOOKS BEHIND HERLOOKING IN HER PLAIN DRESS OF SOME THIN WOOLLENWHITE MATERIAL WITHOUTA SINGLE ORNAMENT ON HER BESIDES HER WEDDINGRING AS IF SHE WERE UNDERA VOW TO BE DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER WOMEN AND WILL SAT DOWN OPPOSITEHER AT TWO YARDS DISTANCE THE LIGHT FALLING ON HIS BRIGHT CURLS ANDDELICATE BUT RATHER PETULANT PROFILE WITH ITS DEFIANT CURVES OF LIPAND CHIN. EACH LOOKED AT THE OTHER AS IF THEY HAD BEEN TWO FLOWERSWHICH HAD OPENED THEN AND THERE. DOROTHEA FOR THE MOMENT FORGOT HERHUSBANDS MYSTERIOUS IRRITATION AGAINST WILL IT SEEMED FRESH WATER ATHER THIRSTY LIPS TO SPEAK WITHOUT FEAR TO THE ONE PERSON WHOM SHE HADFOUND RECEPTIVE FOR IN LOOKING BACKWARD THROUGH SADNESS SHEEXAGGERATED A PAST SOLACE.I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU AGAIN SHESAID IMMEDIATELY. IT SEEMS STRANGE TO ME HOW MANY THINGS I SAID TOYOU.I REMEMBER THEM ALL SAID WILL WITH THE UNSPEAKABLE CONTENT IN HISSOUL OF FEELING THAT HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF A CREATURE WORTHY TO BEPERFECTLY LOVED. I THINK HIS OWN FEELINGS AT THAT MOMENT WERE PERFECTFOR WE MORTALS HAVE OUR DIVINE MOMENTS WHEN LOVE IS SATISFIED IN THECOMPLETENESS OF THE BELOVED OBJECT.I HAVE TRIED TO LEARN A GREAT DEAL SINCE WE WERE IN ROME SAIDDOROTHEA. I CAN READ LATIN A LITTLE AND I AM BEGINNING TO UNDERSTANDJUST A LITTLE GREEK. I CAN HELP MR. CASAUBON BETTER NOW. I CAN FIND OUTREFERENCES FOR HIM AND SAVE HIS EYES IN MANY WAYS. BUT IT IS VERYDIFFICULT TO BE LEARNED IT SEEMS AS IF PEOPLE WERE WORN OUT ON THE WAYTO GREAT THOUGHTS AND CAN NEVER ENJOY THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE TOOTIRED.IF A MAN HAS A CAPACITY FOR GREAT THOUGHTS HE IS LIKELY TO OVERTAKETHEM BEFORE HE IS DECREPIT SAID WILL WITH IRREPRESSIBLE QUICKNESS.BUT THROUGH CERTAIN SENSIBILITIES DOROTHEA WAS AS QUICK AS HE ANDSEEING HER FACE CHANGE HE ADDED IMMEDIATELY BUT IT IS QUITE TRUETHAT THE BEST MINDS HAVE BEEN SOMETIMES OVERSTRAINED IN WORKING OUTTHEIR IDEAS.YOU CORRECT ME SAID DOROTHEA. I EXPRESSED MYSELF ILL. I SHOULD HAVESAID THAT THOSE WHO HAVE GREAT THOUGHTS GET TOO MUCH WORN IN WORKINGTHEM OUT. I USED TO FEEL ABOUT THAT EVEN WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL ANDIT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT THE USE I SHOULD LIKE TO MAKE OF MY LIFEWOULD BE TO HELP SOME ONE WHO DID GREAT WORKS SO THAT HIS BURTHENMIGHT BE LIGHTER.DOROTHEA WAS LED ON TO THIS BIT OF AUTOBIOGRAPHY WITHOUT ANY SENSE OFMAKING A REVELATION. BUT SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE SAID ANYTHING TO WILLWHICH THREW SO STRONG A LIGHT ON HER MARRIAGE. HE DID NOT SHRUG HISSHOULDERS AND FOR WANT OF THAT MUSCULAR OUTLET HE THOUGHT THE MOREIRRITABLY OF BEAUTIFUL LIPS KISSING HOLY SKULLS AND OTHER EMPTINESSESECCLESIASTICALLY ENSHRINED. ALSO HE HAD TO TAKE CARE THAT HIS SPEECHSHOULD NOT BETRAY THAT THOUGHT.BUT YOU MAY EASILY CARRY THE HELP TOO FAR HE SAID AND GETOVERWROUGHT YOURSELF. ARE YOU NOT TOO MUCH SHUT UP YOU ALREADY LOOKPALER. IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR MR. CASAUBON TO HAVE A SECRETARY HECOULD EASILY GET A MAN WHO WOULD DO HALF HIS WORK FOR HIM. IT WOULDSAVE HIM MORE EFFECTUALLY AND YOU NEED ONLY HELP HIM IN LIGHTER WAYS.HOW CAN YOU THINK OF THAT SAID DOROTHEA IN A TONE OF EARNESTREMONSTRANCE. I SHOULD HAVE NO HAPPINESS IF I DID NOT HELP HIM IN HISWORK. WHAT COULD I DO THERE IS NO GOOD TO BE DONE IN LOWICK. THE ONLYTHING I DESIRE IS TO HELP HIM MORE. AND HE OBJECTS TO A SECRETARYPLEASE NOT TO MENTION THAT AGAIN.CERTAINLY NOT NOW I KNOW YOUR FEELING. BUT I HAVE HEARD BOTH MR.BROOKE AND SIR JAMES CHETTAM EXPRESS THE SAME WISH.YES SAID DOROTHEA BUT THEY DONT UNDERSTANDTHEY WANT ME TO BE AGREAT DEAL ON HORSEBACK AND HAVE THE GARDEN ALTERED AND NEWCONSERVATORIES TO FILL UP MY DAYS. I THOUGHT YOU COULD UNDERSTAND THATONES MIND HAS OTHER WANTS SHE ADDED RATHER IMPATIENTLYBESIDESMR. CASAUBON CANNOT BEAR TO HEAR OF A SECRETARY.MY MISTAKE IS EXCUSABLE SAID WILL. IN OLD DAYS I USED TO HEAR MR.CASAUBON SPEAK AS IF HE LOOKED FORWARD TO HAVING A SECRETARY. INDEED HEHELD OUT THE PROSPECT OF THAT OFFICE TO ME. BUT I TURNED OUT TO BENOTGOOD ENOUGH FOR IT.DOROTHEA WAS TRYING TO EXTRACT OUT OF THIS AN EXCUSE FOR HER HUSBANDSEVIDENT REPULSION AS SHE SAID WITH A PLAYFUL SMILE YOU WERE NOT ASTEADY WORKER ENOUGH.NO SAID WILL SHAKING HIS HEAD BACKWARD SOMEWHAT AFTER THE MANNER OFA SPIRITED HORSE. AND THEN THE OLD IRRITABLE DEMON PROMPTING HIM TOGIVE ANOTHER GOOD PINCH AT THE MOTHWINGS OF POOR MR. CASAUBONS GLORYHE WENT ON AND I HAVE SEEN SINCE THAT MR. CASAUBON DOES NOT LIKE ANYONE TO OVERLOOK HIS WORK AND KNOW THOROUGHLY WHAT HE IS DOING. HE ISTOO DOUBTFULTOO UNCERTAIN OF HIMSELF. I MAY NOT BE GOOD FOR MUCH BUTHE DISLIKES ME BECAUSE I DISAGREE WITH HIM.WILL WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS INTENTIONS TO BE ALWAYS GENEROUS BUT OURTONGUES ARE LITTLE TRIGGERS WHICH HAVE USUALLY BEEN PULLED BEFOREGENERAL INTENTIONS CAN BE BROUGHT TO BEAR. AND IT WAS TOO INTOLERABLETHAT CASAUBONS DISLIKE OF HIM SHOULD NOT BE FAIRLY ACCOUNTED FOR TODOROTHEA. YET WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN HE WAS RATHER UNEASY AS TO THE EFFECTON HER.BUT DOROTHEA WAS STRANGELY QUIETNOT IMMEDIATELY INDIGNANT AS SHE HADBEEN ON A LIKE OCCASION IN ROME. AND THE CAUSE LAY DEEP. SHE WAS NOLONGER STRUGGLING AGAINST THE PERCEPTION OF FACTS BUT ADJUSTINGHERSELF TO THEIR CLEAREST PERCEPTION AND NOW WHEN SHE LOOKED STEADILYAT HER HUSBANDS FAILURE STILL MORE AT HIS POSSIBLE CONSCIOUSNESS OFFAILURE SHE SEEMED TO BE LOOKING ALONG THE ONE TRACK WHERE DUTY BECAMETENDERNESS. WILLS WANT OF RETICENCE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MET WITH MORESEVERITY IF HE HAD NOT ALREADY BEEN RECOMMENDED TO HER MERCY BY HERHUSBANDS DISLIKE WHICH MUST SEEM HARD TO HER TILL SHE SAW BETTERREASON FOR IT.SHE DID NOT ANSWER AT ONCE BUT AFTER LOOKING DOWN RUMINATINGLY SHESAID WITH SOME EARNESTNESS MR. CASAUBON MUST HAVE OVERCOME HISDISLIKE OF YOU SO FAR AS HIS ACTIONS WERE CONCERNED AND THAT ISADMIRABLE.YES HE HAS SHOWN A SENSE OF JUSTICE IN FAMILY MATTERS. IT WAS ANABOMINABLE THING THAT MY GRANDMOTHER SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISINHERITEDBECAUSE SHE MADE WHAT THEY CALLED A MESALLIANCE THOUGH THERE WASNOTHING TO BE SAID AGAINST HER HUSBAND EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A POLISHREFUGEE WHO GAVE LESSONS FOR HIS BREAD.I WISH I KNEW ALL ABOUT HER SAID DOROTHEA. I WONDER HOW SHE BORETHE CHANGE FROM WEALTH TO POVERTY I WONDER WHETHER SHE WAS HAPPY WITHHER HUSBAND DO YOU KNOW MUCH ABOUT THEMNO ONLY THAT MY GRANDFATHER WAS A PATRIOTA BRIGHT FELLOWCOULD SPEAKMANY LANGUAGESMUSICALGOT HIS BREAD BY TEACHING ALL SORTS OF THINGS.THEY BOTH DIED RATHER EARLY. AND I NEVER KNEW MUCH OF MY FATHER BEYONDWHAT MY MOTHER TOLD ME BUT HE INHERITED THE MUSICAL TALENTS. IREMEMBER HIS SLOW WALK AND HIS LONG THIN HANDS AND ONE DAY REMAINSWITH ME WHEN HE WAS LYING ILL AND I WAS VERY HUNGRY AND HAD ONLY ALITTLE BIT OF BREAD.AH WHAT A DIFFERENT LIFE FROM MINE SAID DOROTHEA WITH KEENINTEREST CLASPING HER HANDS ON HER LAP. I HAVE ALWAYS HAD TOO MUCH OFEVERYTHING. BUT TELL ME HOW IT WASMR. CASAUBON COULD NOT HAVE KNOWNABOUT YOU THEN.NO BUT MY FATHER HAD MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO MR. CASAUBON AND THAT WASMY LAST HUNGRY DAY. MY FATHER DIED SOON AFTER AND MY MOTHER AND I WEREWELL TAKEN CARE OF. MR. CASAUBON ALWAYS EXPRESSLY RECOGNIZED IT AS HISDUTY TO TAKE CARE OF US BECAUSE OF THE HARSH INJUSTICE WHICH HAD BEENSHOWN TO HIS MOTHERS SISTER. BUT NOW I AM TELLING YOU WHAT IS NOT NEWTO YOU.IN HIS INMOST SOUL WILL WAS CONSCIOUS OF WISHING TO TELL DOROTHEA WHATWAS RATHER NEW EVEN IN HIS OWN CONSTRUCTION OF THINGSNAMELY THAT MR.CASAUBON HAD NEVER DONE MORE THAN PAY A DEBT TOWARDS HIM. WILL WAS MUCHTOO GOOD A FELLOW TO BE EASY UNDER THE SENSE OF BEING UNGRATEFUL. ANDWHEN GRATITUDE HAS BECOME A MATTER OF REASONING THERE ARE MANY WAYS OFESCAPING FROM ITS BONDS.NO ANSWERED DOROTHEA MR. CASAUBON HAS ALWAYS AVOIDED DWELLING ONHIS OWN HONORABLE ACTIONS. SHE DID NOT FEEL THAT HER HUSBANDS CONDUCTWAS DEPRECIATED BUT THIS NOTION OF WHAT JUSTICE HAD REQUIRED IN HISRELATIONS WITH WILL LADISLAW TOOK STRONG HOLD ON HER MIND. AFTER AMOMENTS PAUSE SHE ADDED HE HAD NEVER TOLD ME THAT HE SUPPORTED YOURMOTHER. IS SHE STILL LIVINGNO SHE DIED BY AN ACCIDENTA FALLFOUR YEARS AGO. IT IS CURIOUS THATMY MOTHER TOO RAN AWAY FROM HER FAMILY BUT NOT FOR THE SAKE OF HERHUSBAND. SHE NEVER WOULD TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT HER FAMILY EXCEPT THATSHE FORSOOK THEM TO GET HER OWN LIVINGWENT ON THE STAGE IN FACT. SHEWAS A DARKEYED CREATURE WITH CRISP RINGLETS AND NEVER SEEMED TO BEGETTING OLD. YOU SEE I COME OF REBELLIOUS BLOOD ON BOTH SIDES WILLENDED SMILING BRIGHTLY AT DOROTHEA WHILE SHE WAS STILL LOOKING WITHSERIOUS INTENTNESS BEFORE HER LIKE A CHILD SEEING A DRAMA FOR THEFIRST TIME.BUT HER FACE TOO BROKE INTO A SMILE AS SHE SAID THAT IS YOURAPOLOGY I SUPPOSE FOR HAVING YOURSELF BEEN RATHER REBELLIOUS I MEANTO MR. CASAUBONS WISHES. YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE NOT DONE WHATHE THOUGHT BEST FOR YOU. AND IF HE DISLIKES YOUYOU WERE SPEAKING OFDISLIKE A LITTLE WHILE AGOBUT I SHOULD RATHER SAY IF HE HAS SHOWN ANYPAINFUL FEELINGS TOWARDS YOU YOU MUST CONSIDER HOW SENSITIVE HE HASBECOME FROM THE WEARING EFFECT OF STUDY. PERHAPS SHE CONTINUEDGETTING INTO A PLEADING TONE MY UNCLE HAS NOT TOLD YOU HOW SERIOUSMR. CASAUBONS ILLNESS WAS. IT WOULD BE VERY PETTY OF US WHO ARE WELLAND CAN BEAR THINGS TO THINK MUCH OF SMALL OFFENCES FROM THOSE WHOCARRY A WEIGHT OF TRIAL.YOU TEACH ME BETTER SAID WILL. I WILL NEVER GRUMBLE ON THAT SUBJECTAGAIN. THERE WAS A GENTLENESS IN HIS TONE WHICH CAME FROM THEUNUTTERABLE CONTENTMENT OF PERCEIVINGWHAT DOROTHEA WAS HARDLYCONSCIOUS OFTHAT SHE WAS TRAVELLING INTO THE REMOTENESS OF PURE PITYAND LOYALTY TOWARDS HER HUSBAND. WILL WAS READY TO ADORE HER PITY ANDLOYALTY IF SHE WOULD ASSOCIATE HIMSELF WITH HER IN MANIFESTING THEM.I HAVE REALLY SOMETIMES BEEN A PERVERSE FELLOW HE WENT ON BUT IWILL NEVER AGAIN IF I CAN HELP IT DO OR SAY WHAT YOU WOULDDISAPPROVE.THAT IS VERY GOOD OF YOU SAID DOROTHEA WITH ANOTHER OPEN SMILE. ISHALL HAVE A LITTLE KINGDOM THEN WHERE I SHALL GIVE LAWS. BUT YOU WILLSOON GO AWAY OUT OF MY RULE I IMAGINE. YOU WILL SOON BE TIRED OFSTAYING AT THE GRANGE.THAT IS A POINT I WANTED TO MENTION TO YOUONE OF THE REASONS WHY IWISHED TO SPEAK TO YOU ALONE. MR. BROOKE PROPOSES THAT I SHOULD STAY INTHIS NEIGHBORHOOD. HE HAS BOUGHT ONE OF THE MIDDLEMARCH NEWSPAPERS ANDHE WISHES ME TO CONDUCT THAT AND ALSO TO HELP HIM IN OTHER WAYS.WOULD NOT THAT BE A SACRIFICE OF HIGHER PROSPECTS FOR YOU SAIDDOROTHEA.PERHAPS BUT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BLAMED FOR THINKING OF PROSPECTS ANDNOT SETTLING TO ANYTHING. AND HERE IS SOMETHING OFFERED TO ME. IF YOUWOULD NOT LIKE ME TO ACCEPT IT I WILL GIVE IT UP. OTHERWISE I WOULDRATHER STAY IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY THAN GO AWAY. I BELONG TONOBODY ANYWHERE ELSE.I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO STAY VERY MUCH SAID DOROTHEA AT ONCE ASSIMPLY AND READILY AS SHE HAD SPOKEN AT ROME. THERE WAS NOT THE SHADOWOF A REASON IN HER MIND AT THE MOMENT WHY SHE SHOULD NOT SAY SO.THEN I WILL STAY SAID LADISLAW SHAKING HIS HEAD BACKWARD RISINGAND GOING TOWARDS THE WINDOW AS IF TO SEE WHETHER THE RAIN HAD CEASED.BUT THE NEXT MOMENT DOROTHEA ACCORDING TO A HABIT WHICH WAS GETTINGCONTINUALLY STRONGER BEGAN TO REFLECT THAT HER HUSBAND FELTDIFFERENTLY FROM HERSELF AND SHE COLORED DEEPLY UNDER THE DOUBLEEMBARRASSMENT OF HAVING EXPRESSED WHAT MIGHT BE IN OPPOSITION TO HERHUSBANDS FEELING AND OF HAVING TO SUGGEST THIS OPPOSITION TO WILL.HIS FACE WAS NOT TURNED TOWARDS HER AND THIS MADE IT EASIER TO SAYBUT MY OPINION IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE ON SUCH A SUBJECT. I THINK YOUSHOULD BE GUIDED BY MR. CASAUBON. I SPOKE WITHOUT THINKING OF ANYTHINGELSE THAN MY OWN FEELING WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REALQUESTION. BUT IT NOW OCCURS TO MEPERHAPS MR. CASAUBON MIGHT SEE THATTHE PROPOSAL WAS NOT WISE. CAN YOU NOT WAIT NOW AND MENTION IT TO HIMI CANT WAIT TODAY SAID WILL INWARDLY SEARED BY THE POSSIBILITYTHAT MR. CASAUBON WOULD ENTER. THE RAIN IS QUITE OVER NOW. I TOLD MR.BROOKE NOT TO CALL FOR ME I WOULD RATHER WALK THE FIVE MILES. I SHALLSTRIKE ACROSS HALSELL COMMON AND SEE THE GLEAMS ON THE WET GRASS. ILIKE THAT.HE APPROACHED HER TO SHAKE HANDS QUITE HURRIEDLY LONGING BUT NOTDARING TO SAY DONT MENTION THE SUBJECT TO MR. CASAUBON. NO HEDARED NOT COULD NOT SAY IT. TO ASK HER TO BE LESS SIMPLE AND DIRECTWOULD BE LIKE BREATHING ON THE CRYSTAL THAT YOU WANT TO SEE THE LIGHTTHROUGH. AND THERE WAS ALWAYS THE OTHER GREAT DREADOF HIMSELF BECOMINGDIMMED AND FOREVER RAYSHORN IN HER EYES.I WISH YOU COULD HAVE STAYED SAID DOROTHEA WITH A TOUCH OFMOURNFULNESS AS SHE ROSE AND PUT OUT HER HAND. SHE ALSO HAD HERTHOUGHT WHICH SHE DID NOT LIKE TO EXPRESSWILL CERTAINLY OUGHT TO LOSENO TIME IN CONSULTING MR. CASAUBONS WISHES BUT FOR HER TO URGE THISMIGHT SEEM AN UNDUE DICTATION.SO THEY ONLY SAID GOODBY AND WILL QUITTED THE HOUSE STRIKINGACROSS THE FIELDS SO AS NOT TO RUN ANY RISK OF ENCOUNTERING MR.CASAUBONS CARRIAGE WHICH HOWEVER DID NOT APPEAR AT THE GATE UNTILFOUR OCLOCK. THAT WAS AN UNPROPITIOUS HOUR FOR COMING HOME IT WAS TOOEARLY TO GAIN THE MORAL SUPPORT UNDER ENNUI OF DRESSING HIS PERSON FORDINNER AND TOO LATE TO UNDRESS HIS MIND OF THE DAYS FRIVOLOUSCEREMONY AND AFFAIRS SO AS TO BE PREPARED FOR A GOOD PLUNGE INTO THESERIOUS BUSINESS OF STUDY. ON SUCH OCCASIONS HE USUALLY THREW INTO ANEASYCHAIR IN THE LIBRARY AND ALLOWED DOROTHEA TO READ THE LONDONPAPERS TO HIM CLOSING HIS EYES THE WHILE. TODAY HOWEVER HE DECLINEDTHAT RELIEF OBSERVING THAT HE HAD ALREADY HAD TOO MANY PUBLIC DETAILSURGED UPON HIM BUT HE SPOKE MORE CHEERFULLY THAN USUAL WHEN DOROTHEAASKED ABOUT HIS FATIGUE AND ADDED WITH THAT AIR OF FORMAL EFFORT WHICHNEVER FORSOOK HIM EVEN WHEN HE SPOKE WITHOUT HIS WAISTCOAT AND CRAVATI HAVE HAD THE GRATIFICATION OF MEETING MY FORMER ACQUAINTANCE DR.SPANNING TODAY AND OF BEING PRAISED BY ONE WHO IS HIMSELF A WORTHYRECIPIENT OF PRAISE. HE SPOKE VERY HANDSOMELY OF MY LATE TRACTATE ONTHE EGYPTIAN MYSTERIESUSING IN FACT TERMS WHICH IT WOULD NOT BECOMEME TO REPEAT. IN UTTERING THE LAST CLAUSE MR. CASAUBON LEANED OVERTHE ELBOW OF HIS CHAIR AND SWAYED HIS HEAD UP AND DOWN APPARENTLY ASA MUSCULAR OUTLET INSTEAD OF THAT RECAPITULATION WHICH WOULD NOT HAVEBEEN BECOMING.I AM VERY GLAD YOU HAVE HAD THAT PLEASURE SAID DOROTHEA DELIGHTEDTO SEE HER HUSBAND LESS WEARY THAN USUAL AT THIS HOUR. BEFORE YOU CAMEI HAD BEEN REGRETTING THAT YOU HAPPENED TO BE OUT TODAY.WHY SO MY DEAR SAID MR. CASAUBON THROWING HIMSELF BACKWARD AGAIN.BECAUSE MR. LADISLAW HAS BEEN HERE AND HE HAS MENTIONED A PROPOSAL OFMY UNCLES WHICH I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR OPINION OF. HER HUSBANDSHE FELT WAS REALLY CONCERNED IN THIS QUESTION. EVEN WITH HER IGNORANCEOF THE WORLD SHE HAD A VAGUE IMPRESSION THAT THE POSITION OFFERED TOWILL WAS OUT OF KEEPING WITH HIS FAMILY CONNECTIONS AND CERTAINLY MR.CASAUBON HAD A CLAIM TO BE CONSULTED. HE DID NOT SPEAK BUT MERELYBOWED.DEAR UNCLE YOU KNOW HAS MANY PROJECTS. IT APPEARS THAT HE HAS BOUGHTONE OF THE MIDDLEMARCH NEWSPAPERS AND HE HAS ASKED MR. LADISLAW TOSTAY IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND CONDUCT THE PAPER FOR HIM BESIDESHELPING HIM IN OTHER WAYS.DOROTHEA LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND WHILE SHE SPOKE BUT HE HAD AT FIRSTBLINKED AND FINALLY CLOSED HIS EYES AS IF TO SAVE THEM WHILE HIS LIPSBECAME MORE TENSE. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION SHE ADDED RATHER TIMIDLYAFTER A SLIGHT PAUSE.DID MR. LADISLAW COME ON PURPOSE TO ASK MY OPINION SAID MR.CASAUBON OPENING HIS EYES NARROWLY WITH A KNIFEEDGED LOOK ATDOROTHEA. SHE WAS REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE ON THE POINT HE INQUIRED ABOUTBUT SHE ONLY BECAME A LITTLE MORE SERIOUS AND HER EYES DID NOT SWERVE.NO SHE ANSWERED IMMEDIATELY HE DID NOT SAY THAT HE CAME TO ASKYOUR OPINION. BUT WHEN HE MENTIONED THE PROPOSAL HE OF COURSE EXPECTEDME TO TELL YOU OF IT.MR. CASAUBON WAS SILENT.I FEARED THAT YOU MIGHT FEEL SOME OBJECTION. BUT CERTAINLY A YOUNG MANWITH SO MUCH TALENT MIGHT BE VERY USEFUL TO MY UNCLEMIGHT HELP HIM TODO GOOD IN A BETTER WAY. AND MR. LADISLAW WISHES TO HAVE SOME FIXEDOCCUPATION. HE HAS BEEN BLAMED HE SAYS FOR NOT SEEKING SOMETHING OFTHAT KIND AND HE WOULD LIKE TO STAY IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE NOONE CARES FOR HIM ELSEWHERE.DOROTHEA FELT THAT THIS WAS A CONSIDERATION TO SOFTEN HER HUSBAND.HOWEVER HE DID NOT SPEAK AND SHE PRESENTLY RECURRED TO DR. SPANNINGAND THE ARCHDEACONS BREAKFAST. BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER SUNSHINE ONTHESE SUBJECTS.THE NEXT MORNING WITHOUT DOROTHEAS KNOWLEDGE MR. CASAUBON DESPATCHEDTHE FOLLOWING LETTER BEGINNING DEAR MR. LADISLAW HE HAD ALWAYSBEFORE ADDRESSED HIM AS WILLMRS. CASAUBON INFORMS ME THAT A PROPOSAL HAS BEEN MADE TO YOU ANDACCORDING TO AN INFERENCE BY NO MEANS STRETCHED HAS ON YOUR PART BEENIN SOME DEGREE ENTERTAINED WHICH INVOLVES YOUR RESIDENCE IN THISNEIGHBORHOOD IN A CAPACITY WHICH I AM JUSTIFIED IN SAYING TOUCHES MYOWN POSITION IN SUCH A WAY AS RENDERS IT NOT ONLY NATURAL ANDWARRANTABLE IN ME WHEN THAT EFFECT IS VIEWED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OFLEGITIMATE FEELING BUT INCUMBENT ON ME WHEN THE SAME EFFECT ISCONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF MY RESPONSIBILITIES TO STATE AT ONCE THATYOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PROPOSAL ABOVE INDICATED WOULD BE HIGHLYOFFENSIVE TO ME. THAT I HAVE SOME CLAIM TO THE EXERCISE OF A VETO HEREWOULD NOT I BELIEVE BE DENIED BY ANY REASONABLE PERSON COGNIZANT OFTHE RELATIONS BETWEEN US RELATIONS WHICH THOUGH THROWN INTO THE PASTBY YOUR RECENT PROCEDURE ARE NOT THEREBY ANNULLED IN THEIR CHARACTEROF DETERMINING ANTECEDENTS. I WILL NOT HERE MAKE REFLECTIONS ON ANYPERSONS JUDGMENT. IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO POINT OUT TO YOURSELF THATTHERE ARE CERTAIN SOCIAL FITNESSES AND PROPRIETIES WHICH SHOULD HINDERA SOMEWHAT NEAR RELATIVE OF MINE FROM BECOMING ANY WISE CONSPICUOUS INTHIS VICINITY IN A STATUS NOT ONLY MUCH BENEATH MY OWN BUT ASSOCIATEDAT BEST WITH THE SCIOLISM OF LITERARY OR POLITICAL ADVENTURERS. AT ANYRATE THE CONTRARY ISSUE MUST EXCLUDE YOU FROM FURTHER RECEPTION AT MYHOUSE.YOURS FAITHFULLYEDWARD CASAUBON.MEANWHILE DOROTHEAS MIND WAS INNOCENTLY AT WORK TOWARDS THE FURTHEREMBITTERMENT OF HER HUSBAND DWELLING WITH A SYMPATHY THAT GREW TOAGITATION ON WHAT WILL HAD TOLD HER ABOUT HIS PARENTS ANDGRANDPARENTS. ANY PRIVATE HOURS IN HER DAY WERE USUALLY SPENT IN HERBLUEGREEN BOUDOIR AND SHE HAD COME TO BE VERY FOND OF ITS PALLIDQUAINTNESS. NOTHING HAD BEEN OUTWARDLY ALTERED THERE BUT WHILE THESUMMER HAD GRADUALLY ADVANCED OVER THE WESTERN FIELDS BEYOND THE AVENUEOF ELMS THE BARE ROOM HAD GATHERED WITHIN IT THOSE MEMORIES OF ANINWARD LIFE WHICH FILL THE AIR AS WITH A CLOUD OF GOOD OR BAD ANGELSTHE INVISIBLE YET ACTIVE FORMS OF OUR SPIRITUAL TRIUMPHS OR OURSPIRITUAL FALLS. SHE HAD BEEN SO USED TO STRUGGLE FOR AND TO FINDRESOLVE IN LOOKING ALONG THE AVENUE TOWARDS THE ARCH OF WESTERN LIGHTTHAT THE VISION ITSELF HAD GAINED A COMMUNICATING POWER. EVEN THE PALESTAG SEEMED TO HAVE REMINDING GLANCES AND TO MEAN MUTELY YES WEKNOW. AND THE GROUP OF DELICATELY TOUCHED MINIATURES HAD MADE ANAUDIENCE AS OF BEINGS NO LONGER DISTURBED ABOUT THEIR OWN EARTHLY LOTBUT STILL HUMANLY INTERESTED. ESPECIALLY THE MYSTERIOUS AUNT JULIAABOUT WHOM DOROTHEA HAD NEVER FOUND IT EASY TO QUESTION HER HUSBAND.AND NOW SINCE HER CONVERSATION WITH WILL MANY FRESH IMAGES HADGATHERED ROUND THAT AUNT JULIA WHO WAS WILLS GRANDMOTHER THE PRESENCEOF THAT DELICATE MINIATURE SO LIKE A LIVING FACE THAT SHE KNEWHELPING TO CONCENTRATE HER FEELINGS. WHAT A WRONG TO CUT OFF THE GIRLFROM THE FAMILY PROTECTION AND INHERITANCE ONLY BECAUSE SHE HAD CHOSENA MAN WHO WAS POOR DOROTHEA EARLY TROUBLING HER ELDERS WITH QUESTIONSABOUT THE FACTS AROUND HER HAD WROUGHT HERSELF INTO SOME INDEPENDENTCLEARNESS AS TO THE HISTORICAL POLITICAL REASONS WHY ELDEST SONS HADSUPERIOR RIGHTS AND WHY LAND SHOULD BE ENTAILED THOSE REASONSIMPRESSING HER WITH A CERTAIN AWE MIGHT BE WEIGHTIER THAN SHE KNEWBUT HERE WAS A QUESTION OF TIES WHICH LEFT THEM UNINFRINGED. HERE WAS ADAUGHTER WHOSE CHILDEVEN ACCORDING TO THE ORDINARY APING OFARISTOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS BY PEOPLE WHO ARE NO MORE ARISTOCRATIC THANRETIRED GROCERS AND WHO HAVE NO MORE LAND TO KEEP TOGETHER THAN ALAWN AND A PADDOCKWOULD HAVE A PRIOR CLAIM. WAS INHERITANCE A QUESTIONOF LIKING OR OF RESPONSIBILITY ALL THE ENERGY OF DOROTHEAS NATUREWENT ON THE SIDE OF RESPONSIBILITYTHE FULFILMENT OF CLAIMS FOUNDED ONOUR OWN DEEDS SUCH AS MARRIAGE AND PARENTAGE.IT WAS TRUE SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT MR. CASAUBON HAD A DEBT TO THELADISLAWSTHAT HE HAD TO PAY BACK WHAT THE LADISLAWS HAD BEEN WRONGEDOF. AND NOW SHE BEGAN TO THINK OF HER HUSBANDS WILL WHICH HAD BEENMADE AT THE TIME OF THEIR MARRIAGE LEAVING THE BULK OF HIS PROPERTY TOHER WITH PROVISO IN CASE OF HER HAVING CHILDREN. THAT OUGHT TO BEALTERED AND NO TIME OUGHT TO BE LOST. THIS VERY QUESTION WHICH HADJUST ARISEN ABOUT WILL LADISLAWS OCCUPATION WAS THE OCCASION FORPLACING THINGS ON A NEW RIGHT FOOTING. HER HUSBAND SHE FELT SUREACCORDING TO ALL HIS PREVIOUS CONDUCT WOULD BE READY TO TAKE THE JUSTVIEW IF SHE PROPOSED ITSHE IN WHOSE INTEREST AN UNFAIR CONCENTRATIONOF THE PROPERTY HAD BEEN URGED. HIS SENSE OF RIGHT HAD SURMOUNTED ANDWOULD CONTINUE TO SURMOUNT ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE CALLED ANTIPATHY. SHESUSPECTED THAT HER UNCLES SCHEME WAS DISAPPROVED BY MR. CASAUBON ANDTHIS MADE IT SEEM ALL THE MORE OPPORTUNE THAT A FRESH UNDERSTANDINGSHOULD BE BEGUN SO THAT INSTEAD OF WILLS STARTING PENNILESS ANDACCEPTING THE FIRST FUNCTION THAT OFFERED ITSELF HE SHOULD FINDHIMSELF IN POSSESSION OF A RIGHTFUL INCOME WHICH SHOULD BE PAID BY HERHUSBAND DURING HIS LIFE AND BY AN IMMEDIATE ALTERATION OF THE WILLSHOULD BE SECURED AT HIS DEATH. THE VISION OF ALL THIS AS WHAT OUGHT TOBE DONE SEEMED TO DOROTHEA LIKE A SUDDEN LETTING IN OF DAYLIGHT WAKINGHER FROM HER PREVIOUS STUPIDITY AND INCURIOUS SELFABSORBED IGNORANCEABOUT HER HUSBANDS RELATION TO OTHERS. WILL LADISLAW HAD REFUSED MR.CASAUBONS FUTURE AID ON A GROUND THAT NO LONGER APPEARED RIGHT TO HERAND MR. CASAUBON HAD NEVER HIMSELF SEEN FULLY WHAT WAS THE CLAIM UPONHIM. BUT HE WILL SAID DOROTHEA. THE GREAT STRENGTH OF HIS CHARACTERLIES HERE. AND WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH OUR MONEY WE MAKE NO USE OF HALFOF OUR INCOME. MY OWN MONEY BUYS ME NOTHING BUT AN UNEASY CONSCIENCE.THERE WAS A PECULIAR FASCINATION FOR DOROTHEA IN THIS DIVISION OFPROPERTY INTENDED FOR HERSELF AND ALWAYS REGARDED BY HER AS EXCESSIVE.SHE WAS BLIND YOU SEE TO MANY THINGS OBVIOUS TO OTHERSLIKELY TOTREAD IN THE WRONG PLACES AS CELIA HAD WARNED HER YET HER BLINDNESSTO WHATEVER DID NOT LIE IN HER OWN PURE PURPOSE CARRIED HER SAFELY BYTHE SIDE OF PRECIPICES WHERE VISION WOULD HAVE BEEN PERILOUS WITH FEAR.THE THOUGHTS WHICH HAD GATHERED VIVIDNESS IN THE SOLITUDE OF HERBOUDOIR OCCUPIED HER INCESSANTLY THROUGH THE DAY ON WHICH MR. CASAUBONHAD SENT HIS LETTER TO WILL. EVERYTHING SEEMED HINDRANCE TO HER TILLSHE COULD FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF OPENING HER HEART TO HER HUSBAND. TOHIS PREOCCUPIED MIND ALL SUBJECTS WERE TO BE APPROACHED GENTLY AND SHEHAD NEVER SINCE HIS ILLNESS LOST FROM HER CONSCIOUSNESS THE DREAD OFAGITATING HIM. BUT WHEN YOUNG ARDOR IS SET BROODING OVER THE CONCEPTIONOF A PROMPT DEED THE DEED ITSELF SEEMS TO START FORTH WITH INDEPENDENTLIFE MASTERING IDEAL OBSTACLES. THE DAY PASSED IN A SOMBRE FASHIONNOT UNUSUAL THOUGH MR. CASAUBON WAS PERHAPS UNUSUALLY SILENT BUTTHERE WERE HOURS OF THE NIGHT WHICH MIGHT BE COUNTED ON ASOPPORTUNITIES OF CONVERSATION FOR DOROTHEA WHEN AWARE OF HERHUSBANDS SLEEPLESSNESS HAD ESTABLISHED A HABIT OF RISING LIGHTING ACANDLE AND READING HIM TO SLEEP AGAIN. AND THIS NIGHT SHE WAS FROM THEBEGINNING SLEEPLESS EXCITED BY RESOLVES. HE SLEPT AS USUAL FOR A FEWHOURS BUT SHE HAD RISEN SOFTLY AND HAD SAT IN THE DARKNESS FOR NEARLYAN HOUR BEFORE HE SAIDDOROTHEA SINCE YOU ARE UP WILL YOU LIGHT A CANDLEDO YOU FEEL ILL DEAR WAS HER FIRST QUESTION AS SHE OBEYED HIM.NO NOT AT ALL BUT I SHALL BE OBLIGED SINCE YOU ARE UP IF YOU WILLREAD ME A FEW PAGES OF LOWTH.MAY I TALK TO YOU A LITTLE INSTEAD SAID DOROTHEA.CERTAINLY.I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT MONEY ALL DAYTHAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD TOOMUCH AND ESPECIALLY THE PROSPECT OF TOO MUCH.THESE MY DEAR DOROTHEA ARE PROVIDENTIAL ARRANGEMENTS.BUT IF ONE HAS TOO MUCH IN CONSEQUENCE OF OTHERS BEING WRONGED ITSEEMS TO ME THAT THE DIVINE VOICE WHICH TELLS US TO SET THAT WRONGRIGHT MUST BE OBEYED.WHAT MY LOVE IS THE BEARING OF YOUR REMARKTHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TOO LIBERAL IN ARRANGEMENTS FOR MEI MEAN WITHREGARD TO PROPERTY AND THAT MAKES ME UNHAPPY.HOW SO I HAVE NONE BUT COMPARATIVELY DISTANT CONNECTIONS.I HAVE BEEN LED TO THINK ABOUT YOUR AUNT JULIA AND HOW SHE WAS LEFTIN POVERTY ONLY BECAUSE SHE MARRIED A POOR MAN AN ACT WHICH WAS NOTDISGRACEFUL SINCE HE WAS NOT UNWORTHY. IT WAS ON THAT GROUND I KNOWTHAT YOU EDUCATED MR. LADISLAW AND PROVIDED FOR HIS MOTHER.DOROTHEA WAITED A FEW MOMENTS FOR SOME ANSWER THAT WOULD HELP HERONWARD. NONE CAME AND HER NEXT WORDS SEEMED THE MORE FORCIBLE TO HERFALLING CLEAR UPON THE DARK SILENCE.BUT SURELY WE SHOULD REGARD HIS CLAIM AS A MUCH GREATER ONE EVEN TOTHE HALF OF THAT PROPERTY WHICH I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE DESTINED FOR ME.AND I THINK HE OUGHT AT ONCE TO BE PROVIDED FOR ON THAT UNDERSTANDING.IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT HE SHOULD BE IN THE DEPENDENCE OF POVERTY WHILE WEARE RICH. AND IF THERE IS ANY OBJECTION TO THE PROPOSAL HE MENTIONEDTHE GIVING HIM HIS TRUE PLACE AND HIS TRUE SHARE WOULD SET ASIDE ANYMOTIVE FOR HIS ACCEPTING IT.MR. LADISLAW HAS PROBABLY BEEN SPEAKING TO YOU ON THIS SUBJECT SAIDMR. CASAUBON WITH A CERTAIN BITING QUICKNESS NOT HABITUAL TO HIM.INDEED NO SAID DOROTHEA EARNESTLY. HOW CAN YOU IMAGINE IT SINCEHE HAS SO LATELY DECLINED EVERYTHING FROM YOU I FEAR YOU THINK TOOHARDLY OF HIM DEAR. HE ONLY TOLD ME A LITTLE ABOUT HIS PARENTS ANDGRANDPARENTS AND ALMOST ALL IN ANSWER TO MY QUESTIONS. YOU ARE SOGOOD SO JUSTYOU HAVE DONE EVERYTHING YOU THOUGHT TO BE RIGHT. BUT ITSEEMS TO ME CLEAR THAT MORE THAN THAT IS RIGHT AND I MUST SPEAK ABOUTIT SINCE I AM THE PERSON WHO WOULD GET WHAT IS CALLED BENEFIT BY THATMORE NOT BEING DONE.THERE WAS A PERCEPTIBLE PAUSE BEFORE MR. CASAUBON REPLIED NOT QUICKLYAS BEFORE BUT WITH A STILL MORE BITING EMPHASIS.DOROTHEA MY LOVE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST OCCASION BUT IT WERE WELLTHAT IT SHOULD BE THE LAST ON WHICH YOU HAVE ASSUMED A JUDGMENT ONSUBJECTS BEYOND YOUR SCOPE. INTO THE QUESTION HOW FAR CONDUCTESPECIALLY IN THE MATTER OF ALLIANCES CONSTITUTES A FORFEITURE OFFAMILY CLAIMS I DO NOT NOW ENTER. SUFFICE IT THAT YOU ARE NOT HEREQUALIFIED TO DISCRIMINATE. WHAT I NOW WISH YOU TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT IACCEPT NO REVISION STILL LESS DICTATION WITHIN THAT RANGE OF AFFAIRSWHICH I HAVE DELIBERATED UPON AS DISTINCTLY AND PROPERLY MINE. IT ISNOT FOR YOU TO INTERFERE BETWEEN ME AND MR. LADISLAW AND STILL LESS TOENCOURAGE COMMUNICATIONS FROM HIM TO YOU WHICH CONSTITUTE A CRITICISMON MY PROCEDURE.POOR DOROTHEA SHROUDED IN THE DARKNESS WAS IN A TUMULT OF CONFLICTINGEMOTIONS. ALARM AT THE POSSIBLE EFFECT ON HIMSELF OF HER HUSBANDSSTRONGLY MANIFESTED ANGER WOULD HAVE CHECKED ANY EXPRESSION OF HER OWNRESENTMENT EVEN IF SHE HAD BEEN QUITE FREE FROM DOUBT AND COMPUNCTIONUNDER THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME JUSTICE IN HIS LASTINSINUATION. HEARING HIM BREATHE QUICKLY AFTER HE HAD SPOKEN SHE SATLISTENING FRIGHTENED WRETCHEDWITH A DUMB INWARD CRY FOR HELP TO BEARTHIS NIGHTMARE OF A LIFE IN WHICH EVERY ENERGY WAS ARRESTED BY DREAD.BUT NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED EXCEPT THAT THEY BOTH REMAINED A LONG WHILESLEEPLESS WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN.THE NEXT DAY MR. CASAUBON RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING ANSWER FROM WILLLADISLAWDEAR MR. CASAUBONI HAVE GIVEN ALL DUE CONSIDERATION TO YOUR LETTEROF YESTERDAY BUT I AM UNABLE TO TAKE PRECISELY YOUR VIEW OF OUR MUTUALPOSITION. WITH THE FULLEST ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF YOUR GENEROUS CONDUCT TOME IN THE PAST I MUST STILL MAINTAIN THAT AN OBLIGATION OF THIS KINDCANNOT FAIRLY FETTER ME AS YOU APPEAR TO EXPECT THAT IT SHOULD. GRANTEDTHAT A BENEFACTORS WISHES MAY CONSTITUTE A CLAIM THERE MUST ALWAYS BEA RESERVATION AS TO THE QUALITY OF THOSE WISHES. THEY MAY POSSIBLYCLASH WITH MORE IMPERATIVE CONSIDERATIONS. OR A BENEFACTORS VETO MIGHTIMPOSE SUCH A NEGATION ON A MANS LIFE THAT THE CONSEQUENT BLANK MIGHTBE MORE CRUEL THAN THE BENEFACTION WAS GENEROUS. I AM MERELY USINGSTRONG ILLUSTRATIONS. IN THE PRESENT CASE I AM UNABLE TO TAKE YOUR VIEWOF THE BEARING WHICH MY ACCEPTANCE OF OCCUPATIONNOT ENRICHINGCERTAINLY BUT NOT DISHONORABLEWILL HAVE ON YOUR OWN POSITION WHICHSEEMS TO ME TOO SUBSTANTIAL TO BE AFFECTED IN THAT SHADOWY MANNER. ANDTHOUGH I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY CHANGE IN OUR RELATIONS WILL OCCURCERTAINLY NONE HAS YET OCCURRED WHICH CAN NULLIFY THE OBLIGATIONSIMPOSED ON ME BY THE PAST PARDON ME FOR NOT SEEING THAT THOSEOBLIGATIONS SHOULD RESTRAIN ME FROM USING THE ORDINARY FREEDOM OFLIVING WHERE I CHOOSE AND MAINTAINING MYSELF BY ANY LAWFUL OCCUPATIONI MAY CHOOSE. REGRETTING THAT THERE EXISTS THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN USAS TO A RELATION IN WHICH THE CONFERRING OF BENEFITS HAS BEEN ENTIRELYON YOUR SIDEI REMAIN YOURS WITH PERSISTENT OBLIGATIONWILL LADISLAW.POOR MR. CASAUBON FELT AND MUST NOT WE BEING IMPARTIAL FEEL WITH HIMA LITTLE THAT NO MAN HAD JUSTER CAUSE FOR DISGUST AND SUSPICION THANHE. YOUNG LADISLAW HE WAS SURE MEANT TO DEFY AND ANNOY HIM MEANT TOWIN DOROTHEAS CONFIDENCE AND SOW HER MIND WITH DISRESPECT AND PERHAPSAVERSION TOWARDS HER HUSBAND. SOME MOTIVE BENEATH THE SURFACE HAD BEENNEEDED TO ACCOUNT FOR WILLS SUDDEN CHANGE OF COURSE IN REJECTING MR.CASAUBONS AID AND QUITTING HIS TRAVELS AND THIS DEFIANT DETERMINATIONTO FIX HIMSELF IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BY TAKING UP SOMETHING SO MUCH ATVARIANCE WITH HIS FORMER CHOICE AS MR. BROOKES MIDDLEMARCH PROJECTSREVEALED CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT THE UNDECLARED MOTIVE HAD RELATION TODOROTHEA. NOT FOR ONE MOMENT DID MR. CASAUBON SUSPECT DOROTHEA OF ANYDOUBLENESS HE HAD NO SUSPICIONS OF HER BUT HE HAD WHAT WAS LITTLELESS UNCOMFORTABLE THE POSITIVE KNOWLEDGE THAT HER TENDENCY TO FORMOPINIONS ABOUT HER HUSBANDS CONDUCT WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH A DISPOSITIONTO REGARD WILL LADISLAW FAVORABLY AND BE INFLUENCED BY WHAT HE SAID.HIS OWN PROUD RETICENCE HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM EVER BEING UNDECEIVED INTHE SUPPOSITION THAT DOROTHEA HAD ORIGINALLY ASKED HER UNCLE TO INVITEWILL TO HIS HOUSE.AND NOW ON RECEIVING WILLS LETTER MR. CASAUBON HAD TO CONSIDER HISDUTY. HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN EASY TO CALL HIS ACTION ANYTHING ELSETHAN DUTY BUT IN THIS CASE CONTENDING MOTIVES THRUST HIM BACK INTONEGATIONS.SHOULD HE APPLY DIRECTLY TO MR. BROOKE AND DEMAND OF THAT TROUBLESOMEGENTLEMAN TO REVOKE HIS PROPOSAL OR SHOULD HE CONSULT SIR JAMESCHETTAM AND GET HIM TO CONCUR IN REMONSTRANCE AGAINST A STEP WHICHTOUCHED THE WHOLE FAMILY IN EITHER CASE MR. CASAUBON WAS AWARE THATFAILURE WAS JUST AS PROBABLE AS SUCCESS. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TOMENTION DOROTHEAS NAME IN THE MATTER AND WITHOUT SOME ALARMINGURGENCY MR. BROOKE WAS AS LIKELY AS NOT AFTER MEETING ALLREPRESENTATIONS WITH APPARENT ASSENT TO WIND UP BY SAYING NEVERFEAR CASAUBON DEPEND UPON IT YOUNG LADISLAW WILL DO YOU CREDIT.DEPEND UPON IT I HAVE PUT MY FINGER ON THE RIGHT THING. AND MR.CASAUBON SHRANK NERVOUSLY FROM COMMUNICATING ON THE SUBJECT WITH SIRJAMES CHETTAM BETWEEN WHOM AND HIMSELF THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANYCORDIALITY AND WHO WOULD IMMEDIATELY THINK OF DOROTHEA WITHOUT ANYMENTION OF HER.POOR MR. CASAUBON WAS DISTRUSTFUL OF EVERYBODYS FEELING TOWARDS HIMESPECIALLY AS A HUSBAND. TO LET ANY ONE SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS JEALOUSWOULD BE TO ADMIT THEIR SUSPECTED VIEW OF HIS DISADVANTAGES TO LETTHEM KNOW THAT HE DID NOT FIND MARRIAGE PARTICULARLY BLISSFUL WOULDIMPLY HIS CONVERSION TO THEIR PROBABLY EARLIER DISAPPROVAL. IT WOULDBE AS BAD AS LETTING CARP AND BRASENOSE GENERALLY KNOW HOW BACKWARDHE WAS IN ORGANIZING THE MATTER FOR HIS KEY TO ALL MYTHOLOGIES. ALLTHROUGH HIS LIFE MR. CASAUBON HAD BEEN TRYING NOT TO ADMIT EVEN TOHIMSELF THE INWARD SORES OF SELFDOUBT AND JEALOUSY. AND ON THE MOSTDELICATE OF ALL PERSONAL SUBJECTS THE HABIT OF PROUD SUSPICIOUSRETICENCE TOLD DOUBLY.THUS MR. CASAUBON REMAINED PROUDLY BITTERLY SILENT. BUT HE HADFORBIDDEN WILL TO COME TO LOWICK MANOR AND HE WAS MENTALLY PREPARINGOTHER MEASURES OF FRUSTRATION.CHAPTER XXXVIII.CEST BEAUCOUP QUE LE JUGEMENT DES HOMMES SUR LES ACTIONS HUMAINESTT OU TARD IL DEVIENT EFFICACE.GUIZOT.SIR JAMES CHETTAM COULD NOT LOOK WITH ANY SATISFACTION ON MR.

SIR JAMESACCOUNTED FOR HIS HAVING COME IN ALONE ONE DAY TO LUNCH WITH THECADWALLADERS BY SAYINGI CANT TALK TO YOU AS I WANT BEFORE CELIA IT MIGHT HURT HER.INDEED IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT.I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANTHE PIONEER AT THE GRANGE DARTED IN MRS.CADWALLADER ALMOST BEFORE THE LAST WORD WAS OFF HER FRIENDS TONGUE.IT IS FRIGHTFULTHIS TAKING TO BUYING WHISTLES AND BLOWING THEM INEVERYBODYS HEARING. LYING IN BED ALL DAY AND PLAYING AT DOMINOES LIKEPOOR LORD PLESSY WOULD BE MORE PRIVATE AND BEARABLE.I SEE THEY ARE BEGINNING TO ATTACK OUR FRIEND BROOKE IN THETRUMPET SAID THE RECTOR LOUNGING BACK AND SMILING EASILY AS HEWOULD HAVE DONE IF HE HAD BEEN ATTACKED HIMSELF. THERE ARE TREMENDOUSSARCASMS AGAINST A LANDLORD NOT A HUNDRED MILES FROM MIDDLEMARCH WHORECEIVES HIS OWN RENTS AND MAKES NO RETURNS.I DO WISH BROOKE WOULD LEAVE THAT OFF SAID SIR JAMES WITH HISLITTLE FROWN OF ANNOYANCE.IS HE REALLY GOING TO BE PUT IN NOMINATION THOUGH SAID MR.CADWALLADER. I SAW FAREBROTHER YESTERDAYHES WHIGGISH HIMSELF HOISTSBROUGHAM AND USEFUL KNOWLEDGE THATS THE WORST I KNOW OF HIMAND HESAYS THAT BROOKE IS GETTING UP A PRETTY STRONG PARTY. BULSTRODE THEBANKER IS HIS FOREMOST MAN. BUT HE THINKS BROOKE WOULD COME OFF BADLYAT A NOMINATION.EXACTLY SAID SIR JAMES WITH EARNESTNESS.

HAWLEYSRATHER ROUGH HE FORGOT THAT HE WAS SPEAKING TO ME. HE SAID IF BROOKEWANTED A PELTING HE COULD GET IT CHEAPER THAN BY GOING TO THEHUSTINGS.I WARNED YOU ALL OF IT SAID MRS. CADWALLADER WAVING HER HANDSOUTWARD. I SAID TO HUMPHREY LONG AGO MR. BROOKE IS GOING TO MAKE ASPLASH IN THE MUD. AND NOW HE HAS DONE IT.WELL HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN IT INTO HIS HEAD TO MARRY SAID THE RECTOR.THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAVER MESS THAN A LITTLE FLIRTATION WITHPOLITICS.HE MAY DO THAT AFTERWARDS SAID MRS. CADWALLADERWHEN HE HAS COMEOUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MUD WITH AN AGUE.WHAT I CARE FOR MOST IS HIS OWN DIGNITY SAID SIR JAMES. OF COURSE ICARE THE MORE BECAUSE OF THE FAMILY. BUT HES GETTING ON IN LIFE NOWAND I DONT LIKE TO THINK OF HIS EXPOSING HIMSELF. THEY WILL BE RAKINGUP EVERYTHING AGAINST HIM.I SUPPOSE ITS NO USE TRYING ANY PERSUASION SAID THE RECTOR.THERES SUCH AN ODD MIXTURE OF OBSTINACY AND CHANGEABLENESS IN BROOKE.HAVE YOU TRIED HIM ON THE SUBJECTWELL NO SAID SIR JAMES I FEEL A DELICACY IN APPEARING TO DICTATE.BUT I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO THIS YOUNG LADISLAW THAT BROOKE IS MAKING AFACTOTUM OF. LADISLAW SEEMS CLEVER ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING. I THOUGHT IT ASWELL TO HEAR WHAT HE HAD TO SAY AND HE IS AGAINST BROOKES STANDINGTHIS TIME. I THINK HELL TURN HIM ROUND I THINK THE NOMINATION MAY BESTAVED OFF.I KNOW SAID MRS. CADWALLADER NODDING. THE INDEPENDENT MEMBERHASNT GOT HIS SPEECHES WELL ENOUGH BY HEART.BUT THIS LADISLAWTHERE AGAIN IS A VEXATIOUS BUSINESS SAID SIRJAMES. WE HAVE HAD HIM TWO OR THREE TIMES TO DINE AT THE HALL YOUHAVE MET HIM BY THE BYE AS BROOKES GUEST AND A RELATION OFCASAUBONS THINKING HE WAS ONLY ON A FLYING VISIT. AND NOW I FIND HESIN EVERYBODYS MOUTH IN MIDDLEMARCH AS THE EDITOR OF THE PIONEER.THERE ARE STORIES GOING ABOUT HIM AS A QUILLDRIVING ALIEN A FOREIGNEMISSARY AND WHAT NOT.CASAUBON WONT LIKE THAT SAID THE RECTOR.THERE IS SOME FOREIGN BLOOD IN LADISLAW RETURNED SIR JAMES. IHOPE HE WONT GO INTO EXTREME OPINIONS AND CARRY BROOKE ON.OH HES A DANGEROUS YOUNG SPRIG THAT MR. LADISLAW SAID MRS.CADWALLADER WITH HIS OPERA SONGS AND HIS READY TONGUE. A SORT OFBYRONIC HEROAN AMOROUS CONSPIRATOR IT STRIKES ME. AND THOMAS AQUINASIS NOT FOND OF HIM. I COULD SEE THAT THE DAY THE PICTURE WAS BROUGHT.I DONT LIKE TO BEGIN ON THE SUBJECT WITH CASAUBON SAID SIR JAMES.HE HAS MORE RIGHT TO INTERFERE THAN I. BUT ITS A DISAGREEABLE AFFAIRALL ROUND. WHAT A CHARACTER FOR ANYBODY WITH DECENT CONNECTIONS TO SHOWHIMSELF INONE OF THOSE NEWSPAPER FELLOWS YOU HAVE ONLY TO LOOK ATKECK WHO MANAGES THE TRUMPET. I SAW HIM THE OTHER DAY WITH HAWLEY.HIS WRITING IS SOUND ENOUGH I BELIEVE BUT HES SUCH A LOW FELLOWTHAT I WISHED HE HAD BEEN ON THE WRONG SIDE.WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT WITH THESE PEDDLING MIDDLEMARCH PAPERS SAID THERECTOR. I DONT SUPPOSE YOU COULD GET A HIGH STYLE OF MAN ANYWHERE TOBE WRITING UP INTERESTS HE DOESNT REALLY CARE ABOUT AND FOR PAY THATHARDLY KEEPS HIM IN AT ELBOWS.EXACTLY THAT MAKES IT SO ANNOYING THAT BROOKE SHOULD HAVE PUT A MANWHO HAS A SORT OF CONNECTION WITH THE FAMILY IN A POSITION OF THATKIND. FOR MY PART I THINK LADISLAW IS RATHER A FOOL FOR ACCEPTING.IT IS AQUINASS FAULT SAID MRS. CADWALLADER. WHY DIDNT HE USE HISINTEREST TO GET LADISLAW MADE AN ATTACHE OR SENT TO INDIA THAT ISHOW FAMILIES GET RID OF TROUBLESOME SPRIGS.THERE IS NO KNOWING TO WHAT LENGTHS THE MISCHIEF MAY GO SAID SIRJAMES ANXIOUSLY. BUT IF CASAUBON SAYS NOTHING WHAT CAN I DOOH MY DEAR SIR JAMES SAID THE RECTOR DONT LET US MAKE TOO MUCH OFALL THIS. IT IS LIKELY ENOUGH TO END IN MERE SMOKE. AFTER A MONTH ORTWO BROOKE AND THIS MASTER LADISLAW WILL GET TIRED OF EACH OTHERLADISLAW WILL TAKE WING BROOKE WILL SELL THE PIONEER AND EVERYTHINGWILL SETTLE DOWN AGAIN AS USUAL.THERE IS ONE GOOD CHANCETHAT HE WILL NOT LIKE TO FEEL HIS MONEYOOZING AWAY SAID MRS. CADWALLADER. IF I KNEW THE ITEMS OF ELECTIONEXPENSES I COULD SCARE HIM. ITS NO USE PLYING HIM WITH WIDE WORDS LIKEEXPENDITURE I WOULDNT TALK OF PHLEBOTOMY I WOULD EMPTY A POT OFLEECHES UPON HIM. WHAT WE GOOD STINGY PEOPLE DONT LIKE IS HAVING OURSIXPENCES SUCKED AWAY FROM US.AND HE WILL NOT LIKE HAVING THINGS RAKED UP AGAINST HIM SAID SIRJAMES. THERE IS THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS ESTATE. THEY HAVE BEGUN UPONTHAT ALREADY. AND IT REALLY IS PAINFUL FOR ME TO SEE. IT IS A NUISANCEUNDER ONES VERY NOSE. I DO THINK ONE IS BOUND TO DO THE BEST FOR ONESLAND AND TENANTS ESPECIALLY IN THESE HARD TIMES.PERHAPS THE TRUMPET MAY ROUSE HIM TO MAKE A CHANGE AND SOME GOODMAY COME OF IT ALL SAID THE RECTOR. I KNOW I SHOULD BE GLAD. ISHOULD HEAR LESS GRUMBLING WHEN MY TITHE IS PAID. I DONT KNOW WHAT ISHOULD DO IF THERE WERE NOT A MODUS IN TIPTON.I WANT HIM TO HAVE A PROPER MAN TO LOOK AFTER THINGSI WANT HIM TOTAKE ON GARTH AGAIN SAID SIR JAMES. HE GOT RID OF GARTH TWELVE YEARSAGO AND EVERYTHING HAS BEEN GOING WRONG SINCE. I THINK OF GETTINGGARTH TO MANAGE FOR MEHE HAS MADE SUCH A CAPITAL PLAN FOR MYBUILDINGS AND LOVEGOOD IS HARDLY UP TO THE MARK. BUT GARTH WOULD NOTUNDERTAKE THE TIPTON ESTATE AGAIN UNLESS BROOKE LEFT IT ENTIRELY TOHIM.IN THE RIGHT OF IT TOO SAID THE RECTOR. GARTH IS AN INDEPENDENTFELLOW AN ORIGINAL SIMPLEMINDED FELLOW. ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS DOINGSOME VALUATION FOR ME HE TOLD ME POINTBLANK THAT CLERGYMEN SELDOMUNDERSTOOD ANYTHING ABOUT BUSINESS AND DID MISCHIEF WHEN THEY MEDDLEDBUT HE SAID IT AS QUIETLY AND RESPECTFULLY AS IF HE HAD BEEN TALKING TOME ABOUT SAILORS. HE WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENT PARISH OF TIPTON IF BROOKEWOULD LET HIM MANAGE. I WISH BY THE HELP OF THE TRUMPET YOU COULDBRING THAT ROUND.IF DOROTHEA HAD KEPT NEAR HER UNCLE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMECHANCE SAID SIR JAMES. SHE MIGHT HAVE GOT SOME POWER OVER HIM INTIME AND SHE WAS ALWAYS UNEASY ABOUT THE ESTATE. SHE HAD WONDERFULLYGOOD NOTIONS ABOUT SUCH THINGS. BUT NOW CASAUBON TAKES HER UP ENTIRELY.CELIA COMPLAINS A GOOD DEAL. WE CAN HARDLY GET HER TO DINE WITH USSINCE HE HAD THAT FIT. SIR JAMES ENDED WITH A LOOK OF PITYING DISGUSTAND MRS. CADWALLADER SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AS MUCH AS TO SAY THATSHE WAS NOT LIKELY TO SEE ANYTHING NEW IN THAT DIRECTION.POOR CASAUBON THE RECTOR SAID. THAT WAS A NASTY ATTACK. I THOUGHTHE LOOKED SHATTERED THE OTHER DAY AT THE ARCHDEACONS.IN POINT OF FACT RESUMED SIR JAMES NOT CHOOSING TO DWELL ON FITSBROOKE DOESNT MEAN BADLY BY HIS TENANTS OR ANY ONE ELSE BUT HE HASGOT THAT WAY OF PARING AND CLIPPING AT EXPENSES.COME THATS A BLESSING SAID MRS. CADWALLADER. THAT HELPS HIM TOFIND HIMSELF IN A MORNING. HE MAY NOT KNOW HIS OWN OPINIONS BUT HEDOES KNOW HIS OWN POCKET.I DONT BELIEVE A MAN IS IN POCKET BY STINGINESS ON HIS LAND SAIDSIR JAMES.OH STINGINESS MAY BE ABUSED LIKE OTHER VIRTUES IT WILL NOT DO TOKEEP ONES OWN PIGS LEAN SAID MRS. CADWALLADER WHO HAD RISEN TO LOOKOUT OF THE WINDOW. BUT TALK OF AN INDEPENDENT POLITICIAN AND HE WILLAPPEAR.WHAT BROOKE SAID HER HUSBAND.YES. NOW YOU PLY HIM WITH THE TRUMPET HUMPHREY AND I WILL PUT THELEECHES ON HIM. WHAT WILL YOU DO SIR JAMESTHE FACT IS I DONT LIKE TO BEGIN ABOUT IT WITH BROOKE IN OUR MUTUALPOSITION THE WHOLE THING IS SO UNPLEASANT. I DO WISH PEOPLE WOULDBEHAVE LIKE GENTLEMEN SAID THE GOOD BARONET FEELING THAT THIS WAS ASIMPLE AND COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMME FOR SOCIAL WELLBEING.HERE YOU ALL ARE EH SAID MR. BROOKE SHUFFLING ROUND AND SHAKINGHANDS. I WAS GOING UP TO THE HALL BYANDBY CHETTAM. BUT ITSPLEASANT TO FIND EVERYBODY YOU KNOW. WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK OFTHINGSGOING ON A LITTLE FAST IT WAS TRUE ENOUGH WHAT LAFITTESAIDSINCE YESTERDAY A CENTURY HAS PASSED AWAYTHEYRE IN THE NEXTCENTURY YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WATER. GOING ON FASTER THANWE ARE.WHY YES SAID THE RECTOR TAKING UP THE NEWSPAPER. HERE IS THETRUMPET ACCUSING YOU OF LAGGING BEHINDDID YOU SEEEH NO SAID MR. BROOKE DROPPING HIS GLOVES INTO HIS HAT AND HASTILYADJUSTING HIS EYEGLASS. BUT MR. CADWALLADER KEPT THE PAPER IN HISHAND SAYING WITH A SMILE IN HIS EYESLOOK HERE ALL THIS IS ABOUT A LANDLORD NOT A HUNDRED MILES FROMMIDDLEMARCH WHO RECEIVES HIS OWN RENTS. THEY SAY HE IS THE MOSTRETROGRESSIVE MAN IN THE COUNTY. I THINK YOU MUST HAVE TAUGHT THEM THATWORD IN THE PIONEER.OH THAT IS KECKAN ILLITERATE FELLOW YOU KNOW. RETROGRESSIVE NOWCOME THATS CAPITAL. HE THINKS IT MEANS DESTRUCTIVE THEY WANT TO MAKEME OUT A DESTRUCTIVE YOU KNOW SAID MR. BROOKE WITH THATCHEERFULNESS WHICH IS USUALLY SUSTAINED BY AN ADVERSARYS IGNORANCE.I THINK HE KNOWS THE MEANING OF THE WORD. HERE IS A SHARP STROKE ORTWO. IF WE HAD TO DESCRIBE A MAN WHO IS RETROGRESSIVE IN THE MOST EVILSENSE OF THE WORDWE SHOULD SAY HE IS ONE WHO WOULD DUB HIMSELF AREFORMER OF OUR CONSTITUTION WHILE EVERY INTEREST FOR WHICH HE ISIMMEDIATELY RESPONSIBLE IS GOING TO DECAY A PHILANTHROPIST WHO CANNOTBEAR ONE ROGUE TO BE HANGED BUT DOES NOT MIND FIVE HONEST TENANTSBEING HALFSTARVED A MAN WHO SHRIEKS AT CORRUPTION AND KEEPS HISFARMS AT RACKRENT WHO ROARS HIMSELF RED AT ROTTEN BOROUGHS AND DOESNOT MIND IF EVERY FIELD ON HIS FARMS HAS A ROTTEN GATE A MAN VERYOPENHEARTED TO LEEDS AND MANCHESTER NO DOUBT HE WOULD GIVE ANYNUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES WHO WILL PAY FOR THEIR SEATS OUT OF THEIR OWNPOCKETS WHAT HE OBJECTS TO GIVING IS A LITTLE RETURN ON RENTDAYS TOHELP A TENANT TO BUY STOCK OR AN OUTLAY ON REPAIRS TO KEEP THE WEATHEROUT AT A TENANTS BARNDOOR OR MAKE HIS HOUSE LOOK A LITTLE LESS LIKEAN IRISH COTTIERS. BUT WE ALL KNOW THE WAGS DEFINITION OF APHILANTHROPIST A MAN WHOSE CHARITY INCREASES DIRECTLY AS THE SQUARE OFTHE DISTANCE. AND SO ON. ALL THE REST IS TO SHOW WHAT SORT OFLEGISLATOR A PHILANTHROPIST IS LIKELY TO MAKE ENDED THE RECTORTHROWING DOWN THE PAPER AND CLASPING HIS HANDS AT THE BACK OF HISHEAD WHILE HE LOOKED AT MR. BROOKE WITH AN AIR OF AMUSED NEUTRALITY.COME THATS RATHER GOOD YOU KNOW SAID MR. BROOKE TAKING UP THEPAPER AND TRYING TO BEAR THE ATTACK AS EASILY AS HIS NEIGHBOR DID BUTCOLORING AND SMILING RATHER NERVOUSLY THAT ABOUT ROARING HIMSELF REDAT ROTTEN BOROUGHSI NEVER MADE A SPEECH ABOUT ROTTEN BOROUGHS IN MYLIFE. AND AS TO ROARING MYSELF RED AND THAT KIND OF THINGTHESE MENNEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOOD SATIRE. SATIRE YOU KNOW SHOULD BE TRUEUP TO A CERTAIN POINT. I RECOLLECT THEY SAID THAT IN THE EDINBURGHSOMEWHEREIT MUST BE TRUE UP TO A CERTAIN POINT.WELL THAT IS REALLY A HIT ABOUT THE GATES SAID SIR JAMES ANXIOUSTO TREAD CAREFULLY. DAGLEY COMPLAINED TO ME THE OTHER DAY THAT HEHADNT GOT A DECENT GATE ON HIS FARM. GARTH HAS INVENTED A NEW PATTERNOF GATEI WISH YOU WOULD TRY IT. ONE OUGHT TO USE SOME OF ONES TIMBERIN THAT WAY.YOU GO IN FOR FANCY FARMING YOU KNOW CHETTAM SAID MR. BROOKEAPPEARING TO GLANCE OVER THE COLUMNS OF THE TRUMPET. THATS YOURHOBBY AND YOU DONT MIND THE EXPENSE.I THOUGHT THE MOST EXPENSIVE HOBBY IN THE WORLD WAS STANDING FORPARLIAMENT SAID MRS. CADWALLADER. THEY SAID THE LAST UNSUCCESSFULCANDIDATE AT MIDDLEMARCHGILES WASNT HIS NAMESPENT TEN THOUSANDPOUNDS AND FAILED BECAUSE HE DID NOT BRIBE ENOUGH. WHAT A BITTERREFLECTION FOR A MANSOMEBODY WAS SAYING SAID THE RECTOR LAUGHINGLY THAT EAST RETFORDWAS NOTHING TO MIDDLEMARCH FOR BRIBERY.NOTHING OF THE KIND SAID MR. BROOKE. THE TORIES BRIBE YOU KNOWHAWLEY AND HIS SET BRIBE WITH TREATING HOT CODLINGS AND THAT SORT OFTHING AND THEY BRING THE VOTERS DRUNK TO THE POLL. BUT THEY ARE NOTGOING TO HAVE IT THEIR OWN WAY IN FUTURENOT IN FUTURE YOU KNOW.MIDDLEMARCH IS A LITTLE BACKWARD I ADMITTHE FREEMEN ARE A LITTLEBACKWARD. BUT WE SHALL EDUCATE THEMWE SHALL BRING THEM ON YOU KNOW.THE BEST PEOPLE THERE ARE ON OUR SIDE.HAWLEY SAYS YOU HAVE MEN ON YOUR SIDE WHO WILL DO YOU HARM REMARKEDSIR JAMES. HE SAYS BULSTRODE THE BANKER WILL DO YOU HARM.AND THAT IF YOU GOT PELTED INTERPOSED MRS. CADWALLADER HALF THEROTTEN EGGS WOULD MEAN HATRED OF YOUR COMMITTEEMAN. GOOD HEAVENSTHINK WHAT IT MUST BE TO BE PELTED FOR WRONG OPINIONS. AND I SEEM TOREMEMBER A STORY OF A MAN THEY PRETENDED TO CHAIR AND LET HIM FALL INTOA DUSTHEAP ON PURPOSEPELTING IS NOTHING TO THEIR FINDING HOLES IN ONES COAT SAID THERECTOR. I CONFESS THATS WHAT I SHOULD BE AFRAID OF IF WE PARSONS HADTO STAND AT THE HUSTINGS FOR PREFERMENT. I SHOULD BE AFRAID OF THEIRRECKONING UP ALL MY FISHING DAYS. UPON MY WORD I THINK THE TRUTH ISTHE HARDEST MISSILE ONE CAN BE PELTED WITH.THE FACT IS SAID SIR JAMES IF A MAN GOES INTO PUBLIC LIFE HE MUSTBE PREPARED FOR THE CONSEQUENCES. HE MUST MAKE HIMSELF PROOF AGAINSTCALUMNY.MY DEAR CHETTAM THAT IS ALL VERY FINE YOU KNOW SAID MR. BROOKE.BUT HOW WILL YOU MAKE YOURSELF PROOF AGAINST CALUMNY YOU SHOULD READHISTORYLOOK AT OSTRACISM PERSECUTION MARTYRDOM AND THAT KIND OFTHING. THEY ALWAYS HAPPEN TO THE BEST MEN YOU KNOW. BUT WHAT IS THATIN HORACEFIAT JUSTITIA RUAT  SOMETHING OR OTHER.EXACTLY SAID SIR JAMES WITH A LITTLE MORE HEAT THAN USUAL. WHAT IMEAN BY BEING PROOF AGAINST CALUMNY IS BEING ABLE TO POINT TO THE FACTAS A CONTRADICTION.AND IT IS NOT MARTYRDOM TO PAY BILLS THAT ONE HAS RUN INTO ONESSELF SAID MRS. CADWALLADER.BUT IT WAS SIR JAMESS EVIDENT ANNOYANCE THAT MOST STIRRED MR. BROOKE.WELL YOU KNOW CHETTAM HE SAID RISING TAKING UP HIS HAT ANDLEANING ON HIS STICK YOU AND I HAVE A DIFFERENT SYSTEM. YOU ARE ALLFOR OUTLAY WITH YOUR FARMS. I DONT WANT TO MAKE OUT THAT MY SYSTEM ISGOOD UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCESUNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES YOU KNOW.THERE OUGHT TO BE A NEW VALUATION MADE FROM TIME TO TIME SAID SIRJAMES. RETURNS ARE VERY WELL OCCASIONALLY BUT I LIKE A FAIRVALUATION. WHAT DO YOU SAY CADWALLADERI AGREE WITH YOU. IF I WERE BROOKE I WOULD CHOKE THE TRUMPET ATONCE BY GETTING GARTH TO MAKE A NEW VALUATION OF THE FARMS AND GIVINGHIM CARTE BLANCHE ABOUT GATES AND REPAIRS THATS MY VIEW OF THEPOLITICAL SITUATION SAID THE RECTOR BROADENING HIMSELF BY STICKINGHIS THUMBS IN HIS ARMHOLES AND LAUGHING TOWARDS MR. BROOKE.THATS A SHOWY SORT OF THING TO DO YOU KNOW SAID MR. BROOKE. BUT ISHOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME OF ANOTHER LANDLORD WHO HAS DISTRESSED HISTENANTS FOR ARREARS AS LITTLE AS I HAVE. I LET THE OLD TENANTS STAY ON.IM UNCOMMONLY EASY LET ME TELL YOU UNCOMMONLY EASY. I HAVE MY OWNIDEAS AND I TAKE MY STAND ON THEM YOU KNOW. A MAN WHO DOES THAT ISALWAYS CHARGED WITH ECCENTRICITY INCONSISTENCY AND THAT KIND OFTHING. WHEN I CHANGE MY LINE OF ACTION I SHALL FOLLOW MY OWN IDEAS.AFTER THAT MR. BROOKE REMEMBERED THAT THERE WAS A PACKET WHICH HE HADOMITTED TO SEND OFF FROM THE GRANGE AND HE BADE EVERYBODY HURRIEDLYGOODBY.I DIDNT WANT TO TAKE A LIBERTY WITH BROOKE SAID SIR JAMES I SEEHE IS NETTLED. BUT AS TO WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT OLD TENANTS IN POINT OFFACT NO NEW TENANT WOULD TAKE THE FARMS ON THE PRESENT TERMS.I HAVE A NOTION THAT HE WILL BE BROUGHT ROUND IN TIME SAID THERECTOR. BUT YOU WERE PULLING ONE WAY ELINOR AND WE WERE PULLINGANOTHER. YOU WANTED TO FRIGHTEN HIM AWAY FROM EXPENSE AND WE WANT TOFRIGHTEN HIM INTO IT. BETTER LET HIM TRY TO BE POPULAR AND SEE THAT HISCHARACTER AS A LANDLORD STANDS IN HIS WAY. I DONT THINK IT SIGNIFIESTWO STRAWS ABOUT THE PIONEER OR LADISLAW OR BROOKES SPEECHIFYINGTO THE MIDDLEMARCHERS. BUT IT DOES SIGNIFY ABOUT THE PARISHIONERS INTIPTON BEING COMFORTABLE.EXCUSE ME IT IS YOU TWO WHO ARE ON THE WRONG TACK SAID MRS.CADWALLADER. YOU SHOULD HAVE PROVED TO HIM THAT HE LOSES MONEY BY BADMANAGEMENT AND THEN WE SHOULD ALL HAVE PULLED TOGETHER. IF YOU PUT HIMAHORSEBACK ON POLITICS I WARN YOU OF THE CONSEQUENCES. IT WAS ALLVERY WELL TO RIDE ON STICKS AT HOME AND CALL THEM IDEAS.CHAPTER XXXIX.IF AS I HAVE YOU ALSO DOE    VERTUE ATTIRED IN WOMAN SEEAND DARE LOVE THAT AND SAY SO TOO    AND FORGET THE HE AND SHEAND IF THIS LOVE THOUGH PLACED SO    FROM PROPHANE MEN YOU HIDEWHICH WILL NO FAITH ON THIS BESTOW    OR IF THEY DOE DERIDETHEN YOU HAVE DONE A BRAVER THING    THAN ALL THE WORTHIES DIDAND A BRAVER THENCE WILL SPRING    WHICH IS TO KEEP THAT HID.DR. DONNE.SIR JAMES CHETTAMS MIND WAS NOT FRUITFUL IN DEVICES BUT HIS GROWINGANXIETY TO ACT ON BROOKE ONCE BROUGHT CLOSE TO HIS CONSTANT BELIEFIN DOROTHEAS CAPACITY FOR INFLUENCE BECAME FORMATIVE AND ISSUED IN ALITTLE PLAN NAMELY TO PLEAD CELIAS INDISPOSITION AS A REASON FORFETCHING DOROTHEA BY HERSELF TO THE HALL AND TO LEAVE HER AT THEGRANGE WITH THE CARRIAGE ON THE WAY AFTER MAKING HER FULLY AWARE OFTHE SITUATION CONCERNING THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ESTATE.IN THIS WAY IT HAPPENED THAT ONE DAY NEAR FOUR OCLOCK WHEN MR. BROOKEAND LADISLAW WERE SEATED IN THE LIBRARY THE DOOR OPENED AND MRS.CASAUBON WAS ANNOUNCED.WILL THE MOMENT BEFORE HAD BEEN LOW IN THE DEPTHS OF BOREDOM ANDOBLIGED TO HELP MR. BROOKE IN ARRANGING DOCUMENTS ABOUT HANGINGSHEEPSTEALERS WAS EXEMPLIFYING THE POWER OUR MINDS HAVE OF RIDINGSEVERAL HORSES AT ONCE BY INWARDLY ARRANGING MEASURES TOWARDS GETTING ALODGING FOR HIMSELF IN MIDDLEMARCH AND CUTTING SHORT HIS CONSTANTRESIDENCE AT THE GRANGE WHILE THERE FLITTED THROUGH ALL THESE STEADIERIMAGES A TICKLING VISION OF A SHEEPSTEALING EPIC WRITTEN WITH HOMERICPARTICULARITY. WHEN MRS. CASAUBON WAS ANNOUNCED HE STARTED UP AS FROMAN ELECTRIC SHOCK AND FELT A TINGLING AT HIS FINGERENDS. ANY ONEOBSERVING HIM WOULD HAVE SEEN A CHANGE IN HIS COMPLEXION IN THEADJUSTMENT OF HIS FACIAL MUSCLES IN THE VIVIDNESS OF HIS GLANCE WHICHMIGHT HAVE MADE THEM IMAGINE THAT EVERY MOLECULE IN HIS BODY HAD PASSEDTHE MESSAGE OF A MAGIC TOUCH. AND SO IT HAD. FOR EFFECTIVE MAGIC ISTRANSCENDENT NATURE AND WHO SHALL MEASURE THE SUBTLETY OF THOSETOUCHES WHICH CONVEY THE QUALITY OF SOUL AS WELL AS BODY AND MAKE AMANS PASSION FOR ONE WOMAN DIFFER FROM HIS PASSION FOR ANOTHER AS JOYIN THE MORNING LIGHT OVER VALLEY AND RIVER AND WHITE MOUNTAINTOPDIFFERS FROM JOY AMONG CHINESE LANTERNS AND GLASS PANELS WILL TOOWAS MADE OF VERY IMPRESSIBLE STUFF. THE BOW OF A VIOLIN DRAWN NEAR HIMCLEVERLY WOULD AT ONE STROKE CHANGE THE ASPECT OF THE WORLD FOR HIMAND HIS POINT OF VIEW SHIFTED AS EASILY AS HIS MOOD. DOROTHEASENTRANCE WAS THE FRESHNESS OF MORNING.WELL MY DEAR THIS IS PLEASANT NOW SAID MR. BROOKE MEETING ANDKISSING HER. YOU HAVE LEFT CASAUBON WITH HIS BOOKS I SUPPOSE. THATSRIGHT. WE MUST NOT HAVE YOU GETTING TOO LEARNED FOR A WOMAN YOU KNOW.THERE IS NO FEAR OF THAT UNCLE SAID DOROTHEA TURNING TO WILL ANDSHAKING HANDS WITH OPEN CHEERFULNESS WHILE SHE MADE NO OTHER FORM OFGREETING BUT WENT ON ANSWERING HER UNCLE. I AM VERY SLOW. WHEN I WANTTO BE BUSY WITH BOOKS I AM OFTEN PLAYING TRUANT AMONG MY THOUGHTS. IFIND IT IS NOT SO EASY TO BE LEARNED AS TO PLAN COTTAGES.SHE SEATED HERSELF BESIDE HER UNCLE OPPOSITE TO WILL AND WAS EVIDENTLYPREOCCUPIED WITH SOMETHING THAT MADE HER ALMOST UNMINDFUL OF HIM. HEWAS RIDICULOUSLY DISAPPOINTED AS IF HE HAD IMAGINED THAT HER COMINGHAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM.WHY YES MY DEAR IT WAS QUITE YOUR HOBBY TO DRAW PLANS. BUT IT WASGOOD TO BREAK THAT OFF A LITTLE. HOBBIES ARE APT TO RUN AWAY WITH USYOU KNOW IT DOESNT DO TO BE RUN AWAY WITH. WE MUST KEEP THE REINS. IHAVE NEVER LET MYSELF BE RUN AWAY WITH I ALWAYS PULLED UP. THAT ISWHAT I TELL LADISLAW. HE AND I ARE ALIKE YOU KNOW HE LIKES TO GO INTOEVERYTHING. WE ARE WORKING AT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. WE SHALL DO A GREATDEAL TOGETHER LADISLAW AND I.YES SAID DOROTHEA WITH CHARACTERISTIC DIRECTNESS SIR JAMES HASBEEN TELLING ME THAT HE IS IN HOPE OF SEEING A GREAT CHANGE MADE SOONIN YOUR MANAGEMENT OF THE ESTATETHAT YOU ARE THINKING OF HAVING THEFARMS VALUED AND REPAIRS MADE AND THE COTTAGES IMPROVED SO THATTIPTON MAY LOOK QUITE ANOTHER PLACE. OH HOW HAPPYSHE WENT ONCLASPING HER HANDS WITH A RETURN TO THAT MORE CHILDLIKE IMPETUOUSMANNER WHICH HAD BEEN SUBDUED SINCE HER MARRIAGE. IF I WERE AT HOMESTILL I SHOULD TAKE TO RIDING AGAIN THAT I MIGHT GO ABOUT WITH YOUAND SEE ALL THAT AND YOU ARE GOING TO ENGAGE MR. GARTH WHO PRAISED MYCOTTAGES SIR JAMES SAYS.CHETTAM IS A LITTLE HASTY MY DEAR SAID MR. BROOKE COLORINGSLIGHTLY A LITTLE HASTY YOU KNOW. I NEVER SAID I SHOULD DO ANYTHINGOF THE KIND. I NEVER SAID I SHOULD NOT DO IT YOU KNOW.HE ONLY FEELS CONFIDENT THAT YOU WILL DO IT SAID DOROTHEA IN AVOICE AS CLEAR AND UNHESITATING AS THAT OF A YOUNG CHORISTER CHANTING ACREDO BECAUSE YOU MEAN TO ENTER PARLIAMENT AS A MEMBER WHO CARES FORTHE IMPROVEMENT OF THE PEOPLE AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS TO BE MADEBETTER IS THE STATE OF THE LAND AND THE LABORERS. THINK OF KIT DOWNESUNCLE WHO LIVES WITH HIS WIFE AND SEVEN CHILDREN IN A HOUSE WITH ONESITTING ROOM AND ONE BEDROOM HARDLY LARGER THAN THIS TABLEAND THOSEPOOR DAGLEYS IN THEIR TUMBLEDOWN FARMHOUSE WHERE THEY LIVE IN THEBACK KITCHEN AND LEAVE THE OTHER ROOMS TO THE RATS THAT IS ONE REASONWHY I DID NOT LIKE THE PICTURES HERE DEAR UNCLEWHICH YOU THINK MESTUPID ABOUT. I USED TO COME FROM THE VILLAGE WITH ALL THAT DIRT ANDCOARSE UGLINESS LIKE A PAIN WITHIN ME AND THE SIMPERING PICTURES INTHE DRAWINGROOM SEEMED TO ME LIKE A WICKED ATTEMPT TO FIND DELIGHT INWHAT IS FALSE WHILE WE DONT MIND HOW HARD THE TRUTH IS FOR THENEIGHBORS OUTSIDE OUR WALLS. I THINK WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO COME FORWARDAND URGE WIDER CHANGES FOR GOOD UNTIL WE HAVE TRIED TO ALTER THE EVILSWHICH LIE UNDER OUR OWN HANDS.DOROTHEA HAD GATHERED EMOTION AS SHE WENT ON AND HAD FORGOTTENEVERYTHING EXCEPT THE RELIEF OF POURING FORTH HER FEELINGS UNCHECKEDAN EXPERIENCE ONCE HABITUAL WITH HER BUT HARDLY EVER PRESENT SINCE HERMARRIAGE WHICH HAD BEEN A PERPETUAL STRUGGLE OF ENERGY WITH FEAR. FORTHE MOMENT WILLS ADMIRATION WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH A CHILLING SENSE OFREMOTENESS. A MAN IS SELDOM ASHAMED OF FEELING THAT HE CANNOT LOVE AWOMAN SO WELL WHEN HE SEES A CERTAIN GREATNESS IN HER NATURE HAVINGINTENDED GREATNESS FOR MEN. BUT NATURE HAS SOMETIMES MADE SADOVERSIGHTS IN CARRYING OUT HER INTENTION AS IN THE CASE OF GOOD MR.BROOKE WHOSE MASCULINE CONSCIOUSNESS WAS AT THIS MOMENT IN RATHER ASTAMMERING CONDITION UNDER THE ELOQUENCE OF HIS NIECE. HE COULD NOTIMMEDIATELY FIND ANY OTHER MODE OF EXPRESSING HIMSELF THAN THAT OFRISING FIXING HIS EYEGLASS AND FINGERING THE PAPERS BEFORE HIM. ATLAST HE SAIDTHERE IS SOMETHING IN WHAT YOU SAY MY DEAR SOMETHING IN WHAT YOUSAYBUT NOT EVERYTHINGEH LADISLAW YOU AND I DONT LIKE OUR PICTURESAND STATUES BEING FOUND FAULT WITH. YOUNG LADIES ARE A LITTLE ARDENTYOU KNOWA LITTLE ONESIDED MY DEAR. FINE ART POETRY THAT KIND OFTHING ELEVATES A NATIONEMOLLIT MORESYOU UNDERSTAND A LITTLE LATINNOW. BUTEH WHATTHESE INTERROGATIVES WERE ADDRESSED TO THE FOOTMAN WHO HAD COME IN TOSAY THAT THE KEEPER HAD FOUND ONE OF DAGLEYS BOYS WITH A LEVERET INHIS HAND JUST KILLED.ILL COME ILL COME. I SHALL LET HIM OFF EASILY YOU KNOW SAID MR.BROOKE ASIDE TO DOROTHEA SHUFFLING AWAY VERY CHEERFULLY.I HOPE YOU FEEL HOW RIGHT THIS CHANGE IS THAT ITHAT SIR JAMES WISHESFOR SAID DOROTHEA TO WILL AS SOON AS HER UNCLE WAS GONE.I DO NOW I HAVE HEARD YOU SPEAK ABOUT IT. I SHALL NOT FORGET WHAT YOUHAVE SAID. BUT CAN YOU THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE AT THIS MOMENT I MAYNOT HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO YOU ABOUT WHAT HASOCCURRED SAID WILL RISING WITH A MOVEMENT OF IMPATIENCE AND HOLDINGTHE BACK OF HIS CHAIR WITH BOTH HANDS.PRAY TELL ME WHAT IT IS SAID DOROTHEA ANXIOUSLY ALSO RISING ANDGOING TO THE OPEN WINDOW WHERE MONK WAS LOOKING IN PANTING ANDWAGGING HIS TAIL. SHE LEANED HER BACK AGAINST THE WINDOWFRAME ANDLAID HER HAND ON THE DOGS HEAD FOR THOUGH AS WE KNOW SHE WAS NOTFOND OF PETS THAT MUST BE HELD IN THE HANDS OR TRODDEN ON SHE WASALWAYS ATTENTIVE TO THE FEELINGS OF DOGS AND VERY POLITE IF SHE HAD TODECLINE THEIR ADVANCES.WILL FOLLOWED HER ONLY WITH HIS EYES AND SAID I PRESUME YOU KNOW THATMR. CASAUBON HAS FORBIDDEN ME TO GO TO HIS HOUSE.NO I DID NOT SAID DOROTHEA AFTER A MOMENTS PAUSE. SHE WASEVIDENTLY MUCH MOVED. I AM VERY VERY SORRY SHE ADDED MOURNFULLY.SHE WAS THINKING OF WHAT WILL HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OFTHE CONVERSATIONBETWEEN HER AND HER HUSBAND IN THE DARKNESS AND SHE WAS ANEW SMITTENWITH HOPELESSNESS THAT SHE COULD INFLUENCE MR. CASAUBONS ACTION. BUTTHE MARKED EXPRESSION OF HER SORROW CONVINCED WILL THAT IT WAS NOT ALLGIVEN TO HIM PERSONALLY AND THAT DOROTHEA HAD NOT BEEN VISITED BY THEIDEA THAT MR. CASAUBONS DISLIKE AND JEALOUSY OF HIM TURNED UPONHERSELF. HE FELT AN ODD MIXTURE OF DELIGHT AND VEXATION OF DELIGHTTHAT HE COULD DWELL AND BE CHERISHED IN HER THOUGHT AS IN A PURE HOMEWITHOUT SUSPICION AND WITHOUT STINTOF VEXATION BECAUSE HE WAS OF TOOLITTLE ACCOUNT WITH HER WAS NOT FORMIDABLE ENOUGH WAS TREATED WITH ANUNHESITATING BENEVOLENCE WHICH DID NOT FLATTER HIM. BUT HIS DREAD OFANY CHANGE IN DOROTHEA WAS STRONGER THAN HIS DISCONTENT AND HE BEGANTO SPEAK AGAIN IN A TONE OF MERE EXPLANATION.MR. CASAUBONS REASON IS HIS DISPLEASURE AT MY TAKING A POSITION HEREWHICH HE CONSIDERS UNSUITED TO MY RANK AS HIS COUSIN. I HAVE TOLD HIMTHAT I CANNOT GIVE WAY ON THIS POINT. IT IS A LITTLE TOO HARD ON ME TOEXPECT THAT MY COURSE IN LIFE IS TO BE HAMPERED BY PREJUDICES WHICH ITHINK RIDICULOUS. OBLIGATION MAY BE STRETCHED TILL IT IS NO BETTER THANA BRAND OF SLAVERY STAMPED ON US WHEN WE WERE TOO YOUNG TO KNOW ITSMEANING. I WOULD NOT HAVE ACCEPTED THE POSITION IF I HAD NOT MEANT TOMAKE IT USEFUL AND HONORABLE. I AM NOT BOUND TO REGARD FAMILY DIGNITYIN ANY OTHER LIGHT.DOROTHEA FELT WRETCHED. SHE THOUGHT HER HUSBAND ALTOGETHER IN THEWRONG ON MORE GROUNDS THAN WILL HAD MENTIONED.IT IS BETTER FOR US NOT TO SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT SHE SAID WITH ATREMULOUSNESS NOT COMMON IN HER VOICE SINCE YOU AND MR. CASAUBONDISAGREE. YOU INTEND TO REMAIN SHE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE LAWN WITHMELANCHOLY MEDITATION.YES BUT I SHALL HARDLY EVER SEE YOU NOW SAID WILL IN A TONE OFALMOST BOYISH COMPLAINT.NO SAID DOROTHEA TURNING HER EYES FULL UPON HIM HARDLY EVER. BUTI SHALL HEAR OF YOU. I SHALL KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING FOR MY UNCLE.I SHALL KNOW HARDLY ANYTHING ABOUT YOU SAID WILL. NO ONE WILL TELLME ANYTHING.OH MY LIFE IS VERY SIMPLE SAID DOROTHEA HER LIPS CURLING WITH ANEXQUISITE SMILE WHICH IRRADIATED HER MELANCHOLY. I AM ALWAYS ATLOWICK.THAT IS A DREADFUL IMPRISONMENT SAID WILL IMPETUOUSLY.NO DONT THINK THAT SAID DOROTHEA. I HAVE NO LONGINGS.HE DID NOT SPEAK BUT SHE REPLIED TO SOME CHANGE IN HIS EXPRESSION. IMEAN FOR MYSELF. EXCEPT THAT I SHOULD LIKE NOT TO HAVE SO MUCH MORETHAN MY SHARE WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING FOR OTHERS. BUT I HAVE A BELIEF OFMY OWN AND IT COMFORTS ME.WHAT IS THAT SAID WILL RATHER JEALOUS OF THE BELIEF.THAT BY DESIRING WHAT IS PERFECTLY GOOD EVEN WHEN WE DONT QUITE KNOWWHAT IT IS AND CANNOT DO WHAT WE WOULD WE ARE PART OF THE DIVINE POWERAGAINST EVILWIDENING THE SKIRTS OF LIGHT AND MAKING THE STRUGGLE WITHDARKNESS NARROWER.THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL MYSTICISMIT IS APLEASE NOT TO CALL IT BY ANY NAME SAID DOROTHEA PUTTING OUT HERHANDS ENTREATINGLY. YOU WILL SAY IT IS PERSIAN OR SOMETHING ELSEGEOGRAPHICAL. IT IS MY LIFE. I HAVE FOUND IT OUT AND CANNOT PART WITHIT. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FINDING OUT MY RELIGION SINCE I WAS A LITTLEGIRL. I USED TO PRAY SO MUCHNOW I HARDLY EVER PRAY. I TRY NOT TO HAVEDESIRES MERELY FOR MYSELF BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE GOOD FOR OTHERS ANDI HAVE TOO MUCH ALREADY. I ONLY TOLD YOU THAT YOU MIGHT KNOW QUITEWELL HOW MY DAYS GO AT LOWICK.GOD BLESS YOU FOR TELLING ME SAID WILL ARDENTLY AND RATHERWONDERING AT HIMSELF. THEY WERE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER LIKE TWO FONDCHILDREN WHO WERE TALKING CONFIDENTIALLY OF BIRDS.WHAT IS YOUR RELIGION SAID DOROTHEA. I MEANNOT WHAT YOU KNOWABOUT RELIGION BUT THE BELIEF THAT HELPS YOU MOSTTO LOVE WHAT IS GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL WHEN I SEE IT SAID WILL. BUT IAM A REBEL I DONT FEEL BOUND AS YOU DO TO SUBMIT TO WHAT I DONTLIKE.BUT IF YOU LIKE WHAT IS GOOD THAT COMES TO THE SAME THING SAIDDOROTHEA SMILING.NOW YOU ARE SUBTLE SAID WILL.YES MR. CASAUBON OFTEN SAYS I AM TOO SUBTLE. I DONT FEEL AS IF IWERE SUBTLE SAID DOROTHEA PLAYFULLY. BUT HOW LONG MY UNCLE IS IMUST GO AND LOOK FOR HIM. I MUST REALLY GO ON TO THE HALL. CELIA ISEXPECTING ME.WILL OFFERED TO TELL MR. BROOKE WHO PRESENTLY CAME AND SAID THAT HEWOULD STEP INTO THE CARRIAGE AND GO WITH DOROTHEA AS FAR AS DAGLEYSTO SPEAK ABOUT THE SMALL DELINQUENT WHO HAD BEEN CAUGHT WITH THELEVERET. DOROTHEA RENEWED THE SUBJECT OF THE ESTATE AS THEY DROVEALONG BUT MR. BROOKE NOT BEING TAKEN UNAWARES GOT THE TALK UNDER HISOWN CONTROL.CHETTAM NOW HE REPLIED HE FINDS FAULT WITH ME MY DEAR BUT ISHOULD NOT PRESERVE MY GAME IF IT WERE NOT FOR CHETTAM AND HE CANTSAY THAT THAT EXPENSE IS FOR THE SAKE OF THE TENANTS YOU KNOW. ITS ALITTLE AGAINST MY FEELINGPOACHING NOW IF YOU COME TO LOOK INTO ITIHAVE OFTEN THOUGHT OF GETTING UP THE SUBJECT. NOT LONG AGO FLAVELLTHE METHODIST PREACHER WAS BROUGHT UP FOR KNOCKING DOWN A HARE THATCAME ACROSS HIS PATH WHEN HE AND HIS WIFE WERE WALKING OUT TOGETHER. HEWAS PRETTY QUICK AND KNOCKED IT ON THE NECK.THAT WAS VERY BRUTAL I THINK SAID DOROTHEA.WELL NOW IT SEEMED RATHER BLACK TO ME I CONFESS IN A METHODISTPREACHER YOU KNOW. AND JOHNSON SAID YOU MAY JUDGE WHAT A HYPOCRITEHE IS. AND UPON MY WORD I THOUGHT FLAVELL LOOKED VERY LITTLE LIKETHE HIGHEST STYLE OF MANAS SOMEBODY CALLS THE CHRISTIANYOUNG THEPOET YOUNG I THINKYOU KNOW YOUNG WELL NOW FLAVELL IN HIS SHABBYBLACK GAITERS PLEADING THAT HE THOUGHT THE LORD HAD SENT HIM AND HISWIFE A GOOD DINNER AND HE HAD A RIGHT TO KNOCK IT DOWN THOUGH NOT AMIGHTY HUNTER BEFORE THE LORD AS NIMROD WASI ASSURE YOU IT WAS RATHERCOMIC FIELDING WOULD HAVE MADE SOMETHING OF ITOR SCOTT NOWSCOTTMIGHT HAVE WORKED IT UP. BUT REALLY WHEN I CAME TO THINK OF IT ICOULDNT HELP LIKING THAT THE FELLOW SHOULD HAVE A BIT OF HARE TO SAYGRACE OVER. ITS ALL A MATTER OF PREJUDICEPREJUDICE WITH THE LAW ONITS SIDE YOU KNOWABOUT THE STICK AND THE GAITERS AND SO ON. HOWEVERIT DOESNT DO TO REASON ABOUT THINGS AND LAW IS LAW. BUT I GOT JOHNSONTO BE QUIET AND I HUSHED THE MATTER UP. I DOUBT WHETHER CHETTAM WOULDNOT HAVE BEEN MORE SEVERE AND YET HE COMES DOWN ON ME AS IF I WERE THEHARDEST MAN IN THE COUNTY. BUT HERE WE ARE AT DAGLEYS.MR. BROOKE GOT DOWN AT A FARMYARDGATE AND DOROTHEA DROVE ON. IT ISWONDERFUL HOW MUCH UGLIER THINGS WILL LOOK WHEN WE ONLY SUSPECT THAT WEARE BLAMED FOR THEM. EVEN OUR OWN PERSONS IN THE GLASS ARE APT TOCHANGE THEIR ASPECT FOR US AFTER WE HAVE HEARD SOME FRANK REMARK ONTHEIR LESS ADMIRABLE POINTS AND ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS ASTONISHINGHOW PLEASANTLY CONSCIENCE TAKES OUR ENCROACHMENTS ON THOSE WHO NEVERCOMPLAIN OR HAVE NOBODY TO COMPLAIN FOR THEM. DAGLEYS HOMESTEAD NEVERBEFORE LOOKED SO DISMAL TO MR. BROOKE AS IT DID TODAY WITH HIS MINDTHUS SORE ABOUT THE FAULTFINDING OF THE TRUMPET ECHOED BY SIRJAMES.IT IS TRUE THAT AN OBSERVER UNDER THAT SOFTENING INFLUENCE OF THE FINEARTS WHICH MAKES OTHER PEOPLES HARDSHIPS PICTURESQUE MIGHT HAVE BEENDELIGHTED WITH THIS HOMESTEAD CALLED FREEMANS END THE OLD HOUSE HADDORMERWINDOWS IN THE DARK RED ROOF TWO OF THE CHIMNEYS WERE CHOKEDWITH IVY THE LARGE PORCH WAS BLOCKED UP WITH BUNDLES OF STICKS ANDHALF THE WINDOWS WERE CLOSED WITH GRAY WORMEATEN SHUTTERS ABOUT WHICHTHE JASMINEBOUGHS GREW IN WILD LUXURIANCE THE MOULDERING GARDEN WALLWITH HOLLYHOCKS PEEPING OVER IT WAS A PERFECT STUDY OF HIGHLY MINGLEDSUBDUED COLOR AND THERE WAS AN AGED GOAT KEPT DOUBTLESS ONINTERESTING SUPERSTITIOUS GROUNDS LYING AGAINST THE OPEN BACKKITCHENDOOR.

BUT THESE TROUBLESOMEASSOCIATIONS WERE JUST NOW STRONGLY PRESENT TO MR. BROOKE AND SPOILEDTHE SCENE FOR HIM. MR. DAGLEY HIMSELF MADE A FIGURE IN THE LANDSCAPECARRYING A PITCHFORK AND WEARING HIS MILKINGHATA VERY OLD BEAVERFLATTENED IN FRONT. HIS COAT AND BREECHES WERE THE BEST HE HAD AND HEWOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WEARING THEM ON THIS WEEKDAY OCCASION IF HE HAD NOTBEEN TO MARKET AND RETURNED LATER THAN USUAL HAVING GIVEN HIMSELF THERARE TREAT OF DINING AT THE PUBLIC TABLE OF THE BLUE BULL. HOW HE CAMETO FALL INTO THIS EXTRAVAGANCE WOULD PERHAPS BE MATTER OF WONDERMENT TOHIMSELF ON THE MORROW BUT BEFORE DINNER SOMETHING IN THE STATE OF THECOUNTRY A SLIGHT PAUSE IN THE HARVEST BEFORE THE FAR DIPS WERE CUTTHE STORIES ABOUT THE NEW KING AND THE NUMEROUS HANDBILLS ON THE WALLSHAD SEEMED TO WARRANT A LITTLE RECKLESSNESS. IT WAS A MAXIM ABOUTMIDDLEMARCH AND REGARDED AS SELFEVIDENT THAT GOOD MEAT SHOULD HAVEGOOD DRINK WHICH LAST DAGLEY INTERPRETED AS PLENTY OF TABLE ALE WELLFOLLOWED UP BY RUMANDWATER. THESE LIQUORS HAVE SO FAR TRUTH IN THEMTHAT THEY WERE NOT FALSE ENOUGH TO MAKE POOR DAGLEY SEEM MERRY THEYONLY MADE HIS DISCONTENT LESS TONGUETIED THAN USUAL. HE HAD ALSO TAKENTOO MUCH IN THE SHAPE OF MUDDY POLITICAL TALK A STIMULANT DANGEROUSLYDISTURBING TO HIS FARMING CONSERVATISM WHICH CONSISTED IN HOLDING THATWHATEVER IS IS BAD AND ANY CHANGE IS LIKELY TO BE WORSE. HE WASFLUSHED AND HIS EYES HAD A DECIDEDLY QUARRELSOME STARE AS HE STOODSTILL GRASPING HIS PITCHFORK WHILE THE LANDLORD APPROACHED WITH HISEASY SHUFFLING WALK ONE HAND IN HIS TROUSERPOCKET AND THE OTHERSWINGING ROUND A THIN WALKINGSTICK.DAGLEY MY GOOD FELLOW BEGAN MR. BROOKE CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS GOINGTO BE VERY FRIENDLY ABOUT THE BOY.OH AY IM A GOOD FELLER AM I THANK YE SIR THANK YE SAIDDAGLEY WITH A LOUD SNARLING IRONY WHICH MADE FAG THE SHEEPDOG STIRFROM HIS SEAT AND PRICK HIS EARS BUT SEEING MONK ENTER THE YARD AFTERSOME OUTSIDE LOITERING FAG SEATED HIMSELF AGAIN IN AN ATTITUDE OFOBSERVATION. IM GLAD TO HEAR IM A GOOD FELLER.MR. BROOKE REFLECTED THAT IT WAS MARKETDAY AND THAT HIS WORTHY TENANTHAD PROBABLY BEEN DINING BUT SAW NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD NOT GO ONSINCE HE COULD TAKE THE PRECAUTION OF REPEATING WHAT HE HAD TO SAY TOMRS. DAGLEY.YOUR LITTLE LAD JACOB HAS BEEN CAUGHT KILLING A LEVERET DAGLEY IHAVE TOLD JOHNSON TO LOCK HIM UP IN THE EMPTY STABLE AN HOUR OR TWOJUST TO FRIGHTEN HIM YOU KNOW.

BUT DAGLEY ONLY THE MORE INCLINED TO HAVE HIS SAY WITH AGENTLEMAN WHO WALKED AWAY FROM HIM FOLLOWED AT ONCE WITH FAGSLOUCHING AT HIS HEELS AND SULLENLY EVADING SOME SMALL AND PROBABLYCHARITABLE ADVANCES ON THE PART OF MONK.HOW DO YOU DO MRS. DAGLEY SAID MR. BROOKE MAKING SOME HASTE. ICAME TO TELL YOU ABOUT YOUR BOY I DONT WANT YOU TO GIVE HIM THESTICK YOU KNOW. HE WAS CAREFUL TO SPEAK QUITE PLAINLY THIS TIME.OVERWORKED MRS. DAGLEYA THIN WORN WOMAN FROM WHOSE LIFE PLEASURE HADSO ENTIRELY VANISHED THAT SHE HAD NOT EVEN ANY SUNDAY CLOTHES WHICHCOULD GIVE HER SATISFACTION IN PREPARING FOR CHURCHHAD ALREADY HAD AMISUNDERSTANDING WITH HER HUSBAND SINCE HE HAD COME HOME AND WAS INLOW SPIRITS EXPECTING THE WORST.

WHEN A MAN AS IS FATHER OF A FAMILY HAS BEENAN SPENT MONEY AT MARKET AND MADE HIMSELF THE WORSE FOR LIQUOR HESDONE ENOUGH MISCHIEF FOR ONE DAY. BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT MYBOYS DONE SIR.NIVER DO YOU MIND WHAT HES DONE SAID DAGLEY MORE FIERCELY ITSMY BUSINESS TO SPEAK AN NOT YOURN. AN I WULL SPEAK TOO. ILL HEV MYSAYSUPPER OR NO.

BROOKECONFIDENTIALLY BUT NOT JUDICIOUSLY. ANOTHER DAY ANOTHER DAY HEADDED TURNING AS IF TO GO.BUT DAGLEY IMMEDIATELY FRONTED HIM AND FAG AT HIS HEELS GROWLED LOWAS HIS MASTERS VOICE GREW LOUDER AND MORE INSULTING WHILE MONK ALSODREW CLOSE IN SILENT DIGNIFIED WATCH. THE LABORERS ON THE WAGON WEREPAUSING TO LISTEN AND IT SEEMED WISER TO BE QUITE PASSIVE THAN TOATTEMPT A RIDICULOUS FLIGHT PURSUED BY A BAWLING MAN.IM NO MORE DRUNK NOR YOU ARE NOR SO MUCH SAID DAGLEY. I CAN CARRYMY LIQUOR AN I KNOW WHAT I MEEAN. AN I MEEAN AS THE KING ULL PUT ASTOP TO T FOR THEM SAY IT AS KNOWS IT AS THERES TO BE A RINFORMAND THEM LANDLORDS AS NEVER DONE THE RIGHT THING BY THEIR TENANTS ULLBE TREATED I THAT WAY AS THEYLL HEV TO SCUTTLE OFF.

AN YOUD BETTER LET MY BOY ALOAN AN LOOK TOYOURSEN AFORE THE RINFORM HAS GOT UPO YOUR BACK. THATS WHAT IN GOTTO SAY CONCLUDED MR. DAGLEY STRIKING HIS FORK INTO THE GROUND WITH AFIRMNESS WHICH PROVED INCONVENIENT AS HE TRIED TO DRAW IT UP AGAIN.AT THIS LAST ACTION MONK BEGAN TO BARK LOUDLY AND IT WAS A MOMENT FORMR. BROOKE TO ESCAPE. HE WALKED OUT OF THE YARD AS QUICKLY AS HE COULDIN SOME AMAZEMENT AT THE NOVELTY OF HIS SITUATION. HE HAD NEVER BEENINSULTED ON HIS OWN LAND BEFORE AND HAD BEEN INCLINED TO REGARDHIMSELF AS A GENERAL FAVORITE WE ARE ALL APT TO DO SO WHEN WE THINKOF OUR OWN AMIABILITY MORE THAN OF WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO WANTOF US. WHEN HE HAD QUARRELLED WITH CALEB GARTH TWELVE YEARS BEFORE HEHAD THOUGHT THAT THE TENANTS WOULD BE PLEASED AT THE LANDLORDS TAKINGEVERYTHING INTO HIS OWN HANDS.SOME WHO FOLLOW THE NARRATIVE OF HIS EXPERIENCE MAY WONDER AT THEMIDNIGHT DARKNESS OF MR. DAGLEY BUT NOTHING WAS EASIER IN THOSE TIMESTHAN FOR AN HEREDITARY FARMER OF HIS GRADE TO BE IGNORANT IN SPITESOMEHOW OF HAVING A RECTOR IN THE TWIN PARISH WHO WAS A GENTLEMAN TOTHE BACKBONE A CURATE NEARER AT HAND WHO PREACHED MORE LEARNEDLY THANTHE RECTOR A LANDLORD WHO HAD GONE INTO EVERYTHING ESPECIALLY FINEART AND SOCIAL IMPROVEMENT AND ALL THE LIGHTS OF MIDDLEMARCH ONLYTHREE MILES OFF. AS TO THE FACILITY WITH WHICH MORTALS ESCAPEKNOWLEDGE TRY AN AVERAGE ACQUAINTANCE IN THE INTELLECTUAL BLAZE OFLONDON AND CONSIDER WHAT THAT ELIGIBLE PERSON FOR A DINNERPARTY WOULDHAVE BEEN IF HE HAD LEARNED SCANT SKILL IN SUMMING FROM THEPARISHCLERK OF TIPTON AND READ A CHAPTER IN THE BIBLE WITH IMMENSEDIFFICULTY BECAUSE SUCH NAMES AS ISAIAH OR APOLLOS REMAINEDUNMANAGEABLE AFTER TWICE SPELLING. POOR DAGLEY READ A FEW VERSESSOMETIMES ON A SUNDAY EVENING AND THE WORLD WAS AT LEAST NOT DARKER TOHIM THAN IT HAD BEEN BEFORE. SOME THINGS HE KNEW THOROUGHLY NAMELYTHE SLOVENLY HABITS OF FARMING AND THE AWKWARDNESS OF WEATHER STOCKAND CROPS AT FREEMANS ENDSO CALLED APPARENTLY BY WAY OF SARCASM TOIMPLY THAT A MAN WAS FREE TO QUIT IT IF HE CHOSE BUT THAT THERE WAS NOEARTHLY BEYOND OPEN TO HIM.CHAPTER XL.WISE IN HIS DAILY WORK WAS HE    TO FRUITS OF DILIGENCEAND NOT TO FAITHS OR POLITY    HE PLIED HIS UTMOST SENSE.THESE PERFECT IN THEIR LITTLE PARTS    WHOSE WORK IS ALL THEIR PRIZEWITHOUT THEM HOW COULD LAWS OR ARTS    OR TOWERED CITIES RISEIN WATCHING EFFECTS IF ONLY OF AN ELECTRIC BATTERY IT IS OFTENNECESSARY TO CHANGE OUR PLACE AND EXAMINE A PARTICULAR MIXTURE OR GROUPAT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE POINT WHERE THE MOVEMENT WE ARE INTERESTED INWAS SET UP. THE GROUP I AM MOVING TOWARDS IS AT CALEB GARTHSBREAKFASTTABLE IN THE LARGE PARLOR WHERE THE MAPS AND DESK WEREFATHER MOTHER AND FIVE OF THE CHILDREN. MARY WAS JUST NOW AT HOMEWAITING FOR A SITUATION WHILE CHRISTY THE BOY NEXT TO HER WASGETTING CHEAP LEARNING AND CHEAP FARE IN SCOTLAND HAVING TO HISFATHERS DISAPPOINTMENT TAKEN TO BOOKS INSTEAD OF THAT SACRED CALLINGBUSINESS.THE LETTERS HAD COMENINE COSTLY LETTERS FOR WHICH THE POSTMAN HADBEEN PAID THREE AND TWOPENCE AND MR. GARTH WAS FORGETTING HIS TEA ANDTOAST WHILE HE READ HIS LETTERS AND LAID THEM OPEN ONE ABOVE THE OTHERSOMETIMES SWAYING HIS HEAD SLOWLY SOMETIMES SCREWING UP HIS MOUTH ININWARD DEBATE BUT NOT FORGETTING TO CUT OFF A LARGE RED SEAL UNBROKENWHICH LETTY SNATCHED UP LIKE AN EAGER TERRIER.THE TALK AMONG THE REST WENT ON UNRESTRAINEDLY FOR NOTHING DISTURBEDCALEBS ABSORPTION EXCEPT SHAKING THE TABLE WHEN HE WAS WRITING.TWO LETTERS OF THE NINE HAD BEEN FOR MARY. AFTER READING THEM SHE HADPASSED THEM TO HER MOTHER AND SAT PLAYING WITH HER TEASPOON ABSENTLYTILL WITH A SUDDEN RECOLLECTION SHE RETURNED TO HER SEWING WHICH SHEHAD KEPT ON HER LAP DURING BREAKFAST.OH DONT SEW MARY SAID BEN PULLING HER ARM DOWN. MAKE ME APEACOCK WITH THIS BREADCRUMB. HE HAD BEEN KNEADING A SMALL MASS FORTHE PURPOSE.NO NO MISCHIEF SAID MARY GOODHUMOREDLY WHILE SHE PRICKED HISHAND LIGHTLY WITH HER NEEDLE. TRY AND MOULD IT YOURSELF YOU HAVE SEENME DO IT OFTEN ENOUGH. I MUST GET THIS SEWING DONE. IT IS FOR ROSAMONDVINCY SHE IS TO BE MARRIED NEXT WEEK AND SHE CANT BE MARRIED WITHOUTTHIS HANDKERCHIEF. MARY ENDED MERRILY AMUSED WITH THE LAST NOTION.WHY CANT SHE MARY SAID LETTY SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN THISMYSTERY AND PUSHING HER HEAD SO CLOSE TO HER SISTER THAT MARY NOWTURNED THE THREATENING NEEDLE TOWARDS LETTYS NOSE.BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF A DOZEN AND WITHOUT IT THERE WOULD ONLY BEELEVEN SAID MARY WITH A GRAVE AIR OF EXPLANATION SO THAT LETTY SANKBACK WITH A SENSE OF KNOWLEDGE.HAVE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND MY DEAR SAID MRS. GARTH LAYING THELETTERS DOWN.I SHALL GO TO THE SCHOOL AT YORK SAID MARY. I AM LESS UNFIT TOTEACH IN A SCHOOL THAN IN A FAMILY. I LIKE TO TEACH CLASSES BEST. ANDYOU SEE I MUST TEACH THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO BE DONE.TEACHING SEEMS TO ME THE MOST DELIGHTFUL WORK IN THE WORLD SAID MRS.GARTH WITH A TOUCH OF REBUKE IN HER TONE. I COULD UNDERSTAND YOUROBJECTION TO IT IF YOU HAD NOT KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH MARY OR IF YOUDISLIKED CHILDREN.I SUPPOSE WE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY ANOTHER DISLIKES WHAT WE LIKEMOTHER SAID MARY RATHER CURTLY. I AM NOT FOND OF A SCHOOLROOM ILIKE THE OUTSIDE WORLD BETTER. IT IS A VERY INCONVENIENT FAULT OFMINE.IT MUST BE VERY STUPID TO BE ALWAYS IN A GIRLS SCHOOL SAID ALFRED.SUCH A SET OF NINCOMPOOPS LIKE MRS. BALLARDS PUPILS WALKING TWO ANDTWO.AND THEY HAVE NO GAMES WORTH PLAYING AT SAID JIM. THEY CAN NEITHERTHROW NOR LEAP. I DONT WONDER AT MARYS NOT LIKING IT.WHAT IS THAT MARY DOESNT LIKE EH SAID THE FATHER LOOKING OVER HISSPECTACLES AND PAUSING BEFORE HE OPENED HIS NEXT LETTER.BEING AMONG A LOT OF NINCOMPOOP GIRLS SAID ALFRED.IS IT THE SITUATION YOU HAD HEARD OF MARY SAID CALEB GENTLYLOOKING AT HIS DAUGHTER.YES FATHER THE SCHOOL AT YORK. I HAVE DETERMINED TO TAKE IT. IT ISQUITE THE BEST. THIRTYFIVE POUNDS AYEAR AND EXTRA PAY FOR TEACHINGTHE SMALLEST STRUMMERS AT THE PIANO.POOR CHILD I WISH SHE COULD STAY AT HOME WITH US SUSAN SAID CALEBLOOKING PLAINTIVELY AT HIS WIFE.MARY WOULD NOT BE HAPPY WITHOUT DOING HER DUTY SAID MRS. GARTHMAGISTERIALLY CONSCIOUS OF HAVING DONE HER OWN.IT WOULDNT MAKE ME HAPPY TO DO SUCH A NASTY DUTY AS THAT SAIDALFREDAT WHICH MARY AND HER FATHER LAUGHED SILENTLY BUT MRS. GARTHSAID GRAVELYDO FIND A FITTER WORD THAN NASTY MY DEAR ALFRED FOR EVERYTHING THATYOU THINK DISAGREEABLE. AND SUPPOSE THAT MARY COULD HELP YOU TO GO TOMR. HANMERS WITH THE MONEY SHE GETSTHAT SEEMS TO ME A GREAT SHAME. BUT SHES AN OLD BRICK SAID ALFREDRISING FROM HIS CHAIR AND PULLING MARYS HEAD BACKWARD TO KISS HER.MARY COLORED AND LAUGHED BUT COULD NOT CONCEAL THAT THE TEARS WERECOMING. CALEB LOOKING ON OVER HIS SPECTACLES WITH THE ANGLES OF HISEYEBROWS FALLING HAD AN EXPRESSION OF MINGLED DELIGHT AND SORROW AS HERETURNED TO THE OPENING OF HIS LETTER AND EVEN MRS. GARTH HER LIPSCURLING WITH A CALM CONTENTMENT ALLOWED THAT INAPPROPRIATE LANGUAGE TOPASS WITHOUT CORRECTION ALTHOUGH BEN IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT UP AND SANGSHES AN OLD BRICK OLD BRICK OLD BRICK TO A CANTERING MEASUREWHICH HE BEAT OUT WITH HIS FIST ON MARYS ARM.BUT MRS. GARTHS EYES WERE NOW DRAWN TOWARDS HER HUSBAND WHO WASALREADY DEEP IN THE LETTER HE WAS READING. HIS FACE HAD AN EXPRESSIONOF GRAVE SURPRISE WHICH ALARMED HER A LITTLE BUT HE DID NOT LIKE TOBE QUESTIONED WHILE HE WAS READING AND SHE REMAINED ANXIOUSLY WATCHINGTILL SHE SAW HIM SUDDENLY SHAKEN BY A LITTLE JOYOUS LAUGH AS HE TURNEDBACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE LETTER AND LOOKING AT HER ABOVE HISSPECTACLES SAID IN A LOW TONE WHAT DO YOU THINK SUSANSHE WENT AND STOOD BEHIND HIM PUTTING HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER WHILETHEY READ THE LETTER TOGETHER. IT WAS FROM SIR JAMES CHETTAM OFFERINGTO MR. GARTH THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FAMILY ESTATES AT FRESHITT ANDELSEWHERE AND ADDING THAT SIR JAMES HAD BEEN REQUESTED BY MR. BROOKEOF TIPTON TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER MR. GARTH WOULD BE DISPOSED AT THE SAMETIME TO RESUME THE AGENCY OF THE TIPTON PROPERTY. THE BARONET ADDED INVERY OBLIGING WORDS THAT HE HIMSELF WAS PARTICULARLY DESIROUS OF SEEINGTHE FRESHITT AND TIPTON ESTATES UNDER THE SAME MANAGEMENT AND HE HOPEDTO BE ABLE TO SHOW THAT THE DOUBLE AGENCY MIGHT BE HELD ON TERMSAGREEABLE TO MR. GARTH WHOM HE WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE AT THE HALL ATTWELVE OCLOCK ON THE FOLLOWING DAY.HE WRITES HANDSOMELY DOESNT HE SUSAN SAID CALEB TURNING HIS EYESUPWARD TO HIS WIFE WHO RAISED HER HAND FROM HIS SHOULDER TO HIS EARWHILE SHE RESTED HER CHIN ON HIS HEAD. BROOKE DIDNT LIKE TO ASK MEHIMSELF I CAN SEE HE CONTINUED LAUGHING SILENTLY.HERE IS AN HONOR TO YOUR FATHER CHILDREN SAID MRS. GARTH LOOKINGROUND AT THE FIVE PAIR OF EYES ALL FIXED ON THE PARENTS. HE IS ASKEDTO TAKE A POST AGAIN BY THOSE WHO DISMISSED HIM LONG AGO. THAT SHOWSTHAT HE DID HIS WORK WELL SO THAT THEY FEEL THE WANT OF HIM.LIKE CINCINNATUSHOORAY SAID BEN RIDING ON HIS CHAIR WITH APLEASANT CONFIDENCE THAT DISCIPLINE WAS RELAXED.WILL THEY COME TO FETCH HIM MOTHER SAID LETTY THINKING OF THEMAYOR AND CORPORATION IN THEIR ROBES.MRS. GARTH PATTED LETTYS HEAD AND SMILED BUT SEEING THAT HER HUSBANDWAS GATHERING UP HIS LETTERS AND LIKELY SOON TO BE OUT OF REACH IN THATSANCTUARY BUSINESS SHE PRESSED HIS SHOULDER AND SAID EMPHATICALLYNOW MIND YOU ASK FAIR PAY CALEB.OH YES SAID CALEB IN A DEEP VOICE OF ASSENT AS IF IT WOULD BEUNREASONABLE TO SUPPOSE ANYTHING ELSE OF HIM. ITLL COME TO BETWEENFOUR AND FIVE HUNDRED THE TWO TOGETHER. THEN WITH A LITTLE START OFREMEMBRANCE HE SAID MARY WRITE AND GIVE UP THAT SCHOOL. STAY ANDHELP YOUR MOTHER. IM AS PLEASED AS PUNCH NOW IVE THOUGHT OF THAT.NO MANNER COULD HAVE BEEN LESS LIKE THAT OF PUNCH TRIUMPHANT THANCALEBS BUT HIS TALENTS DID NOT LIE IN FINDING PHRASES THOUGH HE WASVERY PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS LETTERWRITING AND REGARDED HIS WIFE AS ATREASURY OF CORRECT LANGUAGE.THERE WAS ALMOST AN UPROAR AMONG THE CHILDREN NOW AND MARY HELD UP THECAMBRIC EMBROIDERY TOWARDS HER MOTHER ENTREATINGLY THAT IT MIGHT BEPUT OUT OF REACH WHILE THE BOYS DRAGGED HER INTO A DANCE. MRS. GARTHIN PLACID JOY BEGAN TO PUT THE CUPS AND PLATES TOGETHER WHILE CALEBPUSHING HIS CHAIR FROM THE TABLE AS IF HE WERE GOING TO MOVE TO THEDESK STILL SAT HOLDING HIS LETTERS IN HIS HAND AND LOOKING ON THEGROUND MEDITATIVELY STRETCHING OUT THE FINGERS OF HIS LEFT HANDACCORDING TO A MUTE LANGUAGE OF HIS OWN. AT LAST HE SAIDITS A THOUSAND PITIES CHRISTY DIDNT TAKE TO BUSINESS SUSAN. I SHALLWANT HELP BYANDBY. AND ALFRED MUST GO OFF TO THE ENGINEERINGIVEMADE UP MY MIND TO THAT. HE FELL INTO MEDITATION AND FINGERRHETORICAGAIN FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN CONTINUED I SHALL MAKE BROOKE HAVENEW AGREEMENTS WITH THE TENANTS AND I SHALL DRAW UP A ROTATION OFCROPS. AND ILL LAY A WAGER WE CAN GET FINE BRICKS OUT OF THE CLAY ATBOTTS CORNER. I MUST LOOK INTO THAT IT WOULD CHEAPEN THE REPAIRS.ITS A FINE BIT OF WORK SUSAN A MAN WITHOUT A FAMILY WOULD BE GLAD TODO IT FOR NOTHING.MIND YOU DONT THOUGH SAID HIS WIFE LIFTING UP HER FINGER.NO NO BUT ITS A FINE THING TO COME TO A MAN WHEN HES SEEN INTO THENATURE OF BUSINESS TO HAVE THE CHANCE OF GETTING A BIT OF THE COUNTRYINTO GOOD FETTLE AS THEY SAY AND PUTTING MEN INTO THE RIGHT WAY WITHTHEIR FARMING AND GETTING A BIT OF GOOD CONTRIVING AND SOLID BUILDINGDONETHAT THOSE WHO ARE LIVING AND THOSE WHO COME AFTER WILL BE THEBETTER FOR. ID SOONER HAVE IT THAN A FORTUNE. I HOLD IT THE MOSTHONORABLE WORK THAT IS. HERE CALEB LAID DOWN HIS LETTERS THRUST HISFINGERS BETWEEN THE BUTTONS OF HIS WAISTCOAT AND SAT UPRIGHT BUTPRESENTLY PROCEEDED WITH SOME AWE IN HIS VOICE AND MOVING HIS HEADSLOWLY ASIDEITS A GREAT GIFT OF GOD SUSAN.THAT IT IS CALEB SAID HIS WIFE WITH ANSWERING FERVOR. AND IT WILLBE A BLESSING TO YOUR CHILDREN TO HAVE HAD A FATHER WHO DID SUCH WORKA FATHER WHOSE GOOD WORK REMAINS THOUGH HIS NAME MAY BE FORGOTTEN. SHECOULD NOT SAY ANY MORE TO HIM THEN ABOUT THE PAY.IN THE EVENING WHEN CALEB RATHER TIRED WITH HIS DAYS WORK WASSEATED IN SILENCE WITH HIS POCKETBOOK OPEN ON HIS KNEE WHILE MRS.GARTH AND MARY WERE AT THEIR SEWING AND LETTY IN A CORNER WASWHISPERING A DIALOGUE WITH HER DOLL MR. FAREBROTHER CAME UP THEORCHARD WALK DIVIDING THE BRIGHT AUGUST LIGHTS AND SHADOWS WITH THETUFTED GRASS AND THE APPLETREE BOUGHS. WE KNOW THAT HE WAS FOND OF HISPARISHIONERS THE GARTHS AND HAD THOUGHT MARY WORTH MENTIONING TOLYDGATE. HE USED TO THE FULL THE CLERGYMANS PRIVILEGE OF DISREGARDINGTHE MIDDLEMARCH DISCRIMINATION OF RANKS AND ALWAYS TOLD HIS MOTHERTHAT MRS. GARTH WAS MORE OF A LADY THAN ANY MATRON IN THE TOWN. STILLYOU SEE HE SPENT HIS EVENINGS AT THE VINCYS WHERE THE MATRON THOUGHLESS OF A LADY PRESIDED OVER A WELLLIT DRAWINGROOM AND WHIST. INTHOSE DAYS HUMAN INTERCOURSE WAS NOT DETERMINED SOLELY BY RESPECT. BUTTHE VICAR DID HEARTILY RESPECT THE GARTHS AND A VISIT FROM HIM WAS NOSURPRISE TO THAT FAMILY. NEVERTHELESS HE ACCOUNTED FOR IT EVEN WHILE HEWAS SHAKING HANDS BY SAYING I COME AS AN ENVOY MRS. GARTH I HAVESOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU AND GARTH ON BEHALF OF FRED VINCY. THE FACT ISPOOR FELLOW HE CONTINUED AS HE SEATED HIMSELF AND LOOKED ROUND WITHHIS BRIGHT GLANCE AT THE THREE WHO WERE LISTENING TO HIM HE HAS TAKENME INTO HIS CONFIDENCE.MARYS HEART BEAT RATHER QUICKLY SHE WONDERED HOW FAR FREDSCONFIDENCE HAD GONE.WE HAVENT SEEN THE LAD FOR MONTHS SAID CALEB. I COULDNT THINKWHAT WAS BECOME OF HIM.HE HAS BEEN AWAY ON A VISIT SAID THE VICAR BECAUSE HOME WAS ALITTLE TOO HOT FOR HIM AND LYDGATE TOLD HIS MOTHER THAT THE POORFELLOW MUST NOT BEGIN TO STUDY YET. BUT YESTERDAY HE CAME AND POUREDHIMSELF OUT TO ME. I AM VERY GLAD HE DID BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN HIM GROWUP FROM A YOUNGSTER OF FOURTEEN AND I AM SO MUCH AT HOME IN THE HOUSETHAT THE CHILDREN ARE LIKE NEPHEWS AND NIECES TO ME. BUT IT IS ADIFFICULT CASE TO ADVISE UPON. HOWEVER HE HAS ASKED ME TO COME ANDTELL YOU THAT HE IS GOING AWAY AND THAT HE IS SO MISERABLE ABOUT HISDEBT TO YOU AND HIS INABILITY TO PAY THAT HE CANT BEAR TO COMEHIMSELF EVEN TO BID YOU GOOD BY.TELL HIM IT DOESNT SIGNIFY A FARTHING SAID CALEB WAVING HIS HAND.WEVE HAD THE PINCH AND HAVE GOT OVER IT. AND NOW IM GOING TO BE ASRICH AS A JEW.WHICH MEANS SAID MRS. GARTH SMILING AT THE VICAR THAT WE AREGOING TO HAVE ENOUGH TO BRING UP THE BOYS WELL AND TO KEEP MARY ATHOME.WHAT IS THE TREASURETROVE SAID MR. FAREBROTHER.IM GOING TO BE AGENT FOR TWO ESTATES FRESHITT AND TIPTON ANDPERHAPS FOR A PRETTY LITTLE BIT OF LAND IN LOWICK BESIDES ITS ALL THESAME FAMILY CONNECTION AND EMPLOYMENT SPREADS LIKE WATER IF ITS ONCESET GOING. IT MAKES ME VERY HAPPY MR. FAREBROTHERHERE CALEB THREWBACK HIS HEAD A LITTLE AND SPREAD HIS ARMS ON THE ELBOWS OF HISCHAIRTHAT IVE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY AGAIN WITH THE LETTING OF THE LANDAND CARRYING OUT A NOTION OR TWO WITH IMPROVEMENTS. ITS A MOSTUNCOMMONLY CRAMPING THING AS IVE OFTEN TOLD SUSAN TO SIT ONHORSEBACK AND LOOK OVER THE HEDGES AT THE WRONG THING AND NOT BE ABLETO PUT YOUR HAND TO IT TO MAKE IT RIGHT. WHAT PEOPLE DO WHO GO INTOPOLITICS I CANT THINK IT DRIVES ME ALMOST MAD TO SEE MISMANAGEMENTOVER ONLY A FEW HUNDRED ACRES.IT WAS SELDOM THAT CALEB VOLUNTEERED SO LONG A SPEECH BUT HISHAPPINESS HAD THE EFFECT OF MOUNTAIN AIR HIS EYES WERE BRIGHT AND THEWORDS CAME WITHOUT EFFORT.I CONGRATULATE YOU HEARTILY GARTH SAID THE VICAR. THIS IS THE BESTSORT OF NEWS I COULD HAVE HAD TO CARRY TO FRED VINCY FOR HE DWELT AGOOD DEAL ON THE INJURY HE HAD DONE YOU IN CAUSING YOU TO PART WITHMONEYROBBING YOU OF IT HE SAIDWHICH YOU WANTED FOR OTHER PURPOSES. IWISH FRED WERE NOT SUCH AN IDLE DOG HE HAS SOME VERY GOOD POINTS ANDHIS FATHER IS A LITTLE HARD UPON HIM.WHERE IS HE GOING SAID MRS. GARTH RATHER COLDLY.HE MEANS TO TRY AGAIN FOR HIS DEGREE AND HE IS GOING UP TO STUDYBEFORE TERM. I HAVE ADVISED HIM TO DO THAT. I DONT URGE HIM TO ENTERTHE CHURCHON THE CONTRARY. BUT IF HE WILL GO AND WORK SO AS TO PASSTHAT WILL BE SOME GUARANTEE THAT HE HAS ENERGY AND A WILL AND HE ISQUITE AT SEA HE DOESNT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. SO FAR HE WILL PLEASEHIS FATHER AND I HAVE PROMISED IN THE MEAN TIME TO TRY AND RECONCILEVINCY TO HIS SONS ADOPTING SOME OTHER LINE OF LIFE. FRED SAYS FRANKLYHE IS NOT FIT FOR A CLERGYMAN AND I WOULD DO ANYTHING I COULD TOHINDER A MAN FROM THE FATAL STEP OF CHOOSING THE WRONG PROFESSION. HEQUOTED TO ME WHAT YOU SAID MISS GARTHDO YOU REMEMBER IT MR.FAREBROTHER USED TO SAY MARY INSTEAD OF MISS GARTH BUT IT WAS PARTOF HIS DELICACY TO TREAT HER WITH THE MORE DEFERENCE BECAUSE ACCORDINGTO MRS. VINCYS PHRASE SHE WORKED FOR HER BREAD.MARY FELT UNCOMFORTABLE BUT DETERMINED TO TAKE THE MATTER LIGHTLYANSWERED AT ONCE I HAVE SAID SO MANY IMPERTINENT THINGS TO FREDWEARE SUCH OLD PLAYFELLOWS.YOU SAID ACCORDING TO HIM THAT HE WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE RIDICULOUSCLERGYMEN WHO HELP TO MAKE THE WHOLE CLERGY RIDICULOUS. REALLY THATWAS SO CUTTING THAT I FELT A LITTLE CUT MYSELF.CALEB LAUGHED. SHE GETS HER TONGUE FROM YOU SUSAN HE SAID WITHSOME ENJOYMENT.NOT ITS FLIPPANCY FATHER SAID MARY QUICKLY FEARING THAT HERMOTHER WOULD BE DISPLEASED. IT IS RATHER TOO BAD OF FRED TO REPEAT MYFLIPPANT SPEECHES TO MR. FAREBROTHER.IT WAS CERTAINLY A HASTY SPEECH MY DEAR SAID MRS. GARTH WITH WHOMSPEAKING EVIL OF DIGNITIES WAS A HIGH MISDEMEANOR. WE SHOULD NOT VALUEOUR VICAR THE LESS BECAUSE THERE WAS A RIDICULOUS CURATE IN THE NEXTPARISH.THERES SOMETHING IN WHAT SHE SAYS THOUGH SAID CALEB NOT DISPOSEDTO HAVE MARYS SHARPNESS UNDERVALUED. A BAD WORKMAN OF ANY SORT MAKESHIS FELLOWS MISTRUSTED. THINGS HANG TOGETHER HE ADDED LOOKING ON THEFLOOR AND MOVING HIS FEET UNEASILY WITH A SENSE THAT WORDS WERESCANTIER THAN THOUGHTS.CLEARLY SAID THE VICAR AMUSED. BY BEING CONTEMPTIBLE WE SET MENSMINDS TO THE TUNE OF CONTEMPT. I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH MISS GARTHS VIEWOF THE MATTER WHETHER I AM CONDEMNED BY IT OR NOT. BUT AS TO FREDVINCY IT IS ONLY FAIR HE SHOULD BE EXCUSED A LITTLE OLDFEATHERSTONES DELUSIVE BEHAVIOR DID HELP TO SPOIL HIM. THERE WASSOMETHING QUITE DIABOLICAL IN NOT LEAVING HIM A FARTHING AFTER ALL. BUTFRED HAS THE GOOD TASTE NOT TO DWELL ON THAT. AND WHAT HE CARES MOSTABOUT IS HAVING OFFENDED YOU MRS. GARTH HE SUPPOSES YOU WILL NEVERTHINK WELL OF HIM AGAIN.I HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN FRED SAID MRS. GARTH WITH DECISION.BUT I SHALL BE READY TO THINK WELL OF HIM AGAIN WHEN HE GIVES ME GOODREASON TO DO SO.AT THIS POINT MARY WENT OUT OF THE ROOM TAKING LETTY WITH HER.OH WE MUST FORGIVE YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN THEYRE SORRY SAID CALEBWATCHING MARY CLOSE THE DOOR. AND AS YOU SAY MR. FAREBROTHER THEREWAS THE VERY DEVIL IN THAT OLD MAN. NOW MARYS GONE OUT I MUST TELLYOU A THINGITS ONLY KNOWN TO SUSAN AND ME AND YOULL NOT TELL ITAGAIN. THE OLD SCOUNDREL WANTED MARY TO BURN ONE OF THE WILLS THE VERYNIGHT HE DIED WHEN SHE WAS SITTING UP WITH HIM BY HERSELF AND HEOFFERED HER A SUM OF MONEY THAT HE HAD IN THE BOX BY HIM IF SHE WOULDDO IT. BUT MARY YOU UNDERSTAND COULD DO NO SUCH THINGWOULD NOT BEHANDLING HIS IRON CHEST AND SO ON. NOW YOU SEE THE WILL HE WANTEDBURNT WAS THIS LAST SO THAT IF MARY HAD DONE WHAT HE WANTED FREDVINCY WOULD HAVE HAD TEN THOUSAND POUNDS. THE OLD MAN DID TURN TO HIMAT THE LAST. THAT TOUCHES POOR MARY CLOSE SHE COULDNT HELP ITSHE WASIN THE RIGHT TO DO WHAT SHE DID BUT SHE FEELS AS SHE SAYS MUCH AS IFSHE HAD KNOCKED DOWN SOMEBODYS PROPERTY AND BROKEN IT AGAINST HERWILL WHEN SHE WAS RIGHTFULLY DEFENDING HERSELF. I FEEL WITH HERSOMEHOW AND IF I COULD MAKE ANY AMENDS TO THE POOR LAD INSTEAD OFBEARING HIM A GRUDGE FOR THE HARM HE DID US I SHOULD BE GLAD TO DO IT.NOW WHAT IS YOUR OPINION SIR SUSAN DOESNT AGREE WITH ME SHESAYSTELL WHAT YOU SAY SUSAN.MARY COULD NOT HAVE ACTED OTHERWISE EVEN IF SHE HAD KNOWN WHAT WOULDBE THE EFFECT ON FRED SAID MRS. GARTH PAUSING FROM HER WORK ANDLOOKING AT MR. FAREBROTHER.AND SHE WAS QUITE IGNORANT OF IT. IT SEEMS TO ME A LOSS WHICH FALLSON ANOTHER BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE RIGHT IS NOT TO LIE UPON OURCONSCIENCE.THE VICAR DID NOT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY AND CALEB SAID ITS THEFEELING. THE CHILD FEELS IN THAT WAY AND I FEEL WITH HER. YOU DONTMEAN YOUR HORSE TO TREAD ON A DOG WHEN YOURE BACKING OUT OF THE WAYBUT IT GOES THROUGH YOU WHEN ITS DONE.I AM SURE MRS. GARTH WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THERE SAID MR.FAREBROTHER WHO FOR SOME REASON SEEMED MORE INCLINED TO RUMINATE THANTO SPEAK. ONE COULD HARDLY SAY THAT THE FEELING YOU MENTION ABOUT FREDIS WRONGOR RATHER MISTAKENTHOUGH NO MAN OUGHT TO MAKE A CLAIM ONSUCH FEELING.WELL WELL SAID CALEB ITS A SECRET. YOU WILL NOT TELL FRED.CERTAINLY NOT. BUT I SHALL CARRY THE OTHER GOOD NEWSTHAT YOU CANAFFORD THE LOSS HE CAUSED YOU.MR. FAREBROTHER LEFT THE HOUSE SOON AFTER AND SEEING MARY IN THEORCHARD WITH LETTY WENT TO SAY GOODBY TO HER. THEY MADE A PRETTYPICTURE IN THE WESTERN LIGHT WHICH BROUGHT OUT THE BRIGHTNESS OF THEAPPLES ON THE OLD SCANTLEAVED BOUGHSMARY IN HER LAVENDER GINGHAM ANDBLACK RIBBONS HOLDING A BASKET WHILE LETTY IN HER WELLWORN NANKINPICKED UP THE FALLEN APPLES. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE PARTICULARLY HOWMARY LOOKED TEN TO ONE YOU WILL SEE A FACE LIKE HERS IN THE CROWDEDSTREET TOMORROW IF YOU ARE THERE ON THE WATCH SHE WILL NOT BE AMONGTHOSE DAUGHTERS OF ZION WHO ARE HAUGHTY AND WALK WITH STRETCHEDOUTNECKS AND WANTON EYES MINCING AS THEY GO LET ALL THOSE PASS AND FIXYOUR EYES ON SOME SMALL PLUMP BROWNISH PERSON OF FIRM BUT QUIETCARRIAGE WHO LOOKS ABOUT HER BUT DOES NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY ISLOOKING AT HER. IF SHE HAS A BROAD FACE AND SQUARE BROW WELLMARKEDEYEBROWS AND CURLY DARK HAIR A CERTAIN EXPRESSION OF AMUSEMENT IN HERGLANCE WHICH HER MOUTH KEEPS THE SECRET OF AND FOR THE REST FEATURESENTIRELY INSIGNIFICANTTAKE THAT ORDINARY BUT NOT DISAGREEABLE PERSONFOR A PORTRAIT OF MARY GARTH. IF YOU MADE HER SMILE SHE WOULD SHOW YOUPERFECT LITTLE TEETH IF YOU MADE HER ANGRY SHE WOULD NOT RAISE HERVOICE BUT WOULD PROBABLY SAY ONE OF THE BITTEREST THINGS YOU HAVE EVERTASTED THE FLAVOR OF IF YOU DID HER A KINDNESS SHE WOULD NEVER FORGETIT. MARY ADMIRED THE KEENFACED HANDSOME LITTLE VICAR IN HISWELLBRUSHED THREADBARE CLOTHES MORE THAN ANY MAN SHE HAD HAD THEOPPORTUNITY OF KNOWING. SHE HAD NEVER HEARD HIM SAY A FOOLISH THINGTHOUGH SHE KNEW THAT HE DID UNWISE ONES AND PERHAPS FOOLISH SAYINGSWERE MORE OBJECTIONABLE TO HER THAN ANY OF MR. FAREBROTHERS UNWISEDOINGS. AT LEAST IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT THE ACTUAL IMPERFECTIONS OFTHE VICARS CLERICAL CHARACTER NEVER SEEMED TO CALL FORTH THE SAMESCORN AND DISLIKE WHICH SHE SHOWED BEFOREHAND FOR THE PREDICTEDIMPERFECTIONS OF THE CLERICAL CHARACTER SUSTAINED BY FRED VINCY. THESEIRREGULARITIES OF JUDGMENT I IMAGINE ARE FOUND EVEN IN RIPER MINDSTHAN MARY GARTHS OUR IMPARTIALITY IS KEPT FOR ABSTRACT MERIT ANDDEMERIT WHICH NONE OF US EVER SAW. WILL ANY ONE GUESS TOWARDS WHICH OFTHOSE WIDELY DIFFERENT MEN MARY HAD THE PECULIAR WOMANSTENDERNESSTHE ONE SHE WAS MOST INCLINED TO BE SEVERE ON OR THECONTRARYHAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR YOUR OLD PLAYFELLOW MISS GARTH SAID THEVICAR AS HE TOOK A FRAGRANT APPLE FROM THE BASKET WHICH SHE HELDTOWARDS HIM AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET. SOMETHING TO SOFTEN DOWN THATHARSH JUDGMENT I AM GOING STRAIGHT TO SEE HIM.NO SAID MARY SHAKING HER HEAD AND SMILING. IF I WERE TO SAY THATHE WOULD NOT BE RIDICULOUS AS A CLERGYMAN I MUST SAY THAT HE WOULD BESOMETHING WORSE THAN RIDICULOUS. BUT I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT HE ISGOING AWAY TO WORK.ON THE OTHER HAND I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU ARE NOT GOINGAWAY TO WORK. MY MOTHER I AM SURE WILL BE ALL THE HAPPIER IF YOU WILLCOME TO SEE HER AT THE VICARAGE YOU KNOW SHE IS FOND OF HAVING YOUNGPEOPLE TO TALK TO AND SHE HAS A GREAT DEAL TO TELL ABOUT OLD TIMES.YOU WILL REALLY BE DOING A KINDNESS.I SHOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH IF I MAY SAID MARY. EVERYTHING SEEMSTOO HAPPY FOR ME ALL AT ONCE. I THOUGHT IT WOULD ALWAYS BE PART OF MYLIFE TO LONG FOR HOME AND LOSING THAT GRIEVANCE MAKES ME FEEL RATHEREMPTY I SUPPOSE IT SERVED INSTEAD OF SENSE TO FILL UP MY MINDMAY I GO WITH YOU MARY WHISPERED LETTYA MOST INCONVENIENT CHILDWHO LISTENED TO EVERYTHING. BUT SHE WAS MADE EXULTANT BY HAVING HERCHIN PINCHED AND HER CHEEK KISSED BY MR. FAREBROTHERAN INCIDENT WHICHSHE NARRATED TO HER MOTHER AND FATHER.AS THE VICAR WALKED TO LOWICK ANY ONE WATCHING HIM CLOSELY MIGHT HAVESEEN HIM TWICE SHRUG HIS SHOULDERS. I THINK THAT THE RARE ENGLISHMENWHO HAVE THIS GESTURE ARE NEVER OF THE HEAVY TYPEFOR FEAR OF ANYLUMBERING INSTANCE TO THE CONTRARY I WILL SAY HARDLY EVER THEY HAVEUSUALLY A FINE TEMPERAMENT AND MUCH TOLERANCE TOWARDS THE SMALLERERRORS OF MEN THEMSELVES INCLUSIVE. THE VICAR WAS HOLDING AN INWARDDIALOGUE IN WHICH HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS PROBABLY SOMETHINGMORE BETWEEN FRED AND MARY GARTH THAN THE REGARD OF OLD PLAYFELLOWSAND REPLIED WITH A QUESTION WHETHER THAT BIT OF WOMANHOOD WERE NOT AGREAT DEAL TOO CHOICE FOR THAT CRUDE YOUNG GENTLEMAN. THE REJOINDER TOTHIS WAS THE FIRST SHRUG. THEN HE LAUGHED AT HIMSELF FOR BEING LIKELYTO HAVE FELT JEALOUS AS IF HE HAD BEEN A MAN ABLE TO MARRY WHICHADDED HE IT IS AS CLEAR AS ANY BALANCESHEET THAT I AM NOT. WHEREUPONFOLLOWED THE SECOND SHRUG.WHAT COULD TWO MEN SO DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER SEE IN THIS BROWNPATCH AS MARY CALLED HERSELF IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT HER PLAINNESS THATATTRACTED THEM AND LET ALL PLAIN YOUNG LADIES BE WARNED AGAINST THEDANGEROUS ENCOURAGEMENT GIVEN THEM BY SOCIETY TO CONFIDE IN THEIR WANTOF BEAUTY. A HUMAN BEING IN THIS AGED NATION OF OURS IS A VERYWONDERFUL WHOLE THE SLOW CREATION OF LONG INTERCHANGING INFLUENCESAND CHARM IS A RESULT OF TWO SUCH WHOLES THE ONE LOVING AND THE ONELOVED.WHEN MR. AND MRS. GARTH WERE SITTING ALONE CALEB SAID SUSAN GUESSWHAT IM THINKING OF.THE ROTATION OF CROPS SAID MRS. GARTH SMILING AT HIM ABOVE HERKNITTING OR ELSE THE BACKDOORS OF THE TIPTON COTTAGES.NO SAID CALEB GRAVELY I AM THINKING THAT I COULD DO A GREAT TURNFOR FRED VINCY. CHRISTYS GONE ALFRED WILL BE GONE SOON AND IT WILLBE FIVE YEARS BEFORE JIM IS READY TO TAKE TO BUSINESS. I SHALL WANTHELP AND FRED MIGHT COME IN AND LEARN THE NATURE OF THINGS AND ACTUNDER ME AND IT MIGHT BE THE MAKING OF HIM INTO A USEFUL MAN IF HEGIVES UP BEING A PARSON. WHAT DO YOU THINKI THINK THERE IS HARDLY ANYTHING HONEST THAT HIS FAMILY WOULD OBJECTTO MORE SAID MRS. GARTH DECIDEDLY.WHAT CARE I ABOUT THEIR OBJECTING SAID CALEB WITH A STURDINESSWHICH HE WAS APT TO SHOW WHEN HE HAD AN OPINION. THE LAD IS OF AGE ANDMUST GET HIS BREAD. HE HAS SENSE ENOUGH AND QUICKNESS ENOUGH HE LIKESBEING ON THE LAND AND ITS MY BELIEF THAT HE COULD LEARN BUSINESS WELLIF HE GAVE HIS MIND TO IT.BUT WOULD HE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WANTED HIM TO BE A FINE GENTLEMANAND I THINK HE HAS THE SAME SORT OF FEELING HIMSELF. THEY ALL THINK USBENEATH THEM. AND IF THE PROPOSAL CAME FROM YOU I AM SURE MRS. VINCYWOULD SAY THAT WE WANTED FRED FOR MARY.LIFE IS A POOR TALE IF IT IS TO BE SETTLED BY NONSENSE OF THAT SORTSAID CALEB WITH DISGUST.YES BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN PRIDE WHICH IS PROPER CALEB.I CALL IT IMPROPER PRIDE TO LET FOOLS NOTIONS HINDER YOU FROM DOING AGOOD ACTION. THERES NO SORT OF WORK SAID CALEB WITH FERVOR PUTTINGOUT HIS HAND AND MOVING IT UP AND DOWN TO MARK HIS EMPHASIS THATCOULD EVER BE DONE WELL IF YOU MINDED WHAT FOOLS SAY. YOU MUST HAVE ITINSIDE YOU THAT YOUR PLAN IS RIGHT AND THAT PLAN YOU MUST FOLLOW.I WILL NOT OPPOSE ANY PLAN YOU HAVE SET YOUR MIND ON CALEB SAIDMRS. GARTH WHO WAS A FIRM WOMAN BUT KNEW THAT THERE WERE SOME POINTSON WHICH HER MILD HUSBAND WAS YET FIRMER. STILL IT SEEMS TO BE FIXEDTHAT FRED IS TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE WILL IT NOT BE BETTER TO WAIT ANDSEE WHAT HE WILL CHOOSE TO DO AFTER THAT IT IS NOT EASY TO KEEP PEOPLEAGAINST THEIR WILL. AND YOU ARE NOT YET QUITE SURE ENOUGH OF YOUR OWNPOSITION OR WHAT YOU WILL WANT.WELL IT MAY BE BETTER TO WAIT A BIT. BUT AS TO MY GETTING PLENTY OFWORK FOR TWO IM PRETTY SURE OF THAT. IVE ALWAYS HAD MY HANDS FULLWITH SCATTERED THINGS AND THERES ALWAYS SOMETHING FRESH TURNING UP.WHY ONLY YESTERDAYBLESS ME I DONT THINK I TOLD YOUIT WAS RATHERODD THAT TWO MEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT ME ON DIFFERENT SIDES TO DO THESAME BIT OF VALUING. AND WHO DO YOU THINK THEY WERE SAID CALEBTAKING A PINCH OF SNUFF AND HOLDING IT UP BETWEEN HIS FINGERS AS IF ITWERE A PART OF HIS EXPOSITION. HE WAS FOND OF A PINCH WHEN IT OCCURREDTO HIM BUT HE USUALLY FORGOT THAT THIS INDULGENCE WAS AT HIS COMMAND.HIS WIFE HELD DOWN HER KNITTING AND LOOKED ATTENTIVE.WHY THAT RIGG OR RIGG FEATHERSTONE WAS ONE. BUT BULSTRODE WASBEFORE HIM SO IM GOING TO DO IT FOR BULSTRODE. WHETHER ITS MORTGAGEOR PURCHASE THEYRE GOING FOR I CANT TELL YET.CAN THAT MAN BE GOING TO SELL THE LAND JUST LEFT HIMWHICH HE HASTAKEN THE NAME FOR SAID MRS. GARTH.DEUCE KNOWS SAID CALEB WHO NEVER REFERRED THE KNOWLEDGE OFDISCREDITABLE DOINGS TO ANY HIGHER POWER THAN THE DEUCE. BUT BULSTRODEHAS LONG BEEN WANTING TO GET A HANDSOME BIT OF LAND UNDER HISFINGERSTHAT I KNOW. AND ITS A DIFFICULT MATTER TO GET IN THIS PARTOF THE COUNTRY.CALEB SCATTERED HIS SNUFF CAREFULLY INSTEAD OF TAKING IT AND THENADDED THE INS AND OUTS OF THINGS ARE CURIOUS. HERE IS THE LANDTHEYVE BEEN ALL ALONG EXPECTING FOR FRED WHICH IT SEEMS THE OLD MANNEVER MEANT TO LEAVE HIM A FOOT OF BUT LEFT IT TO THIS SIDESLIP OF ASON THAT HE KEPT IN THE DARK AND THOUGHT OF HIS STICKING THERE ANDVEXING EVERYBODY AS WELL AS HE COULD HAVE VEXED EM HIMSELF IF HE COULDHAVE KEPT ALIVE. I SAY IT WOULD BE CURIOUS IF IT GOT INTO BULSTRODESHANDS AFTER ALL. THE OLD MAN HATED HIM AND NEVER WOULD BANK WITH HIM.WHAT REASON COULD THE MISERABLE CREATURE HAVE FOR HATING A MAN WHOM HEHAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SAID MRS. GARTH.POOH WHERES THE USE OF ASKING FOR SUCH FELLOWS REASONS THE SOUL OFMAN SAID CALEB WITH THE DEEP TONE AND GRAVE SHAKE OF THE HEAD WHICHALWAYS CAME WHEN HE USED THIS PHRASETHE SOUL OF MAN WHEN IT GETSFAIRLY ROTTEN WILL BEAR YOU ALL SORTS OF POISONOUS TOADSTOOLS AND NOEYE CAN SEE WHENCE CAME THE SEED THEREOF.IT WAS ONE OF CALEBS QUAINTNESSES THAT IN HIS DIFFICULTY OF FINDINGSPEECH FOR HIS THOUGHT HE CAUGHT AS IT WERE SNATCHES OF DICTIONWHICH HE ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS POINTS OF VIEW OR STATES OF MIND ANDWHENEVER HE HAD A FEELING OF AWE HE WAS HAUNTED BY A SENSE OF BIBLICALPHRASEOLOGY THOUGH HE COULD HARDLY HAVE GIVEN A STRICT QUOTATION.CHAPTER XLI.BY SWAGGERING COULD I NEVER THRIVEFOR THE RAIN IT RAINETH EVERY DAY.TWELFTH NIGHT.THE TRANSACTIONS REFERRED TO BY CALEB GARTH AS HAVING GONE FORWARDBETWEEN MR. BULSTRODE AND MR. JOSHUA RIGG FEATHERSTONE CONCERNING THELAND ATTACHED TO STONE COURT HAD OCCASIONED THE INTERCHANGE OF ALETTER OR TWO BETWEEN THESE PERSONAGES.WHO SHALL TELL WHAT MAY BE THE EFFECT OF WRITING IF IT HAPPENS TO HAVEBEEN CUT IN STONE THOUGH IT LIE FACE DOWNMOST FOR AGES ON A FORSAKENBEACH OR REST QUIETLY UNDER THE DRUMS AND TRAMPLINGS OF MANYCONQUESTS IT MAY END BY LETTING US INTO THE SECRET OF USURPATIONS ANDOTHER SCANDALS GOSSIPED ABOUT LONG EMPIRES AGOTHIS WORLD BEINGAPPARENTLY A HUGE WHISPERINGGALLERY. SUCH CONDITIONS ARE OFTENMINUTELY REPRESENTED IN OUR PETTY LIFETIMES. AS THE STONE WHICH HASBEEN KICKED BY GENERATIONS OF CLOWNS MAY COME BY CURIOUS LITTLE LINKSOF EFFECT UNDER THE EYES OF A SCHOLAR THROUGH WHOSE LABORS IT MAY ATLAST FIX THE DATE OF INVASIONS AND UNLOCK RELIGIONS SO A BIT OF INKAND PAPER WHICH HAS LONG BEEN AN INNOCENT WRAPPING OR STOPGAP MAY ATLAST BE LAID OPEN UNDER THE ONE PAIR OF EYES WHICH HAVE KNOWLEDGEENOUGH TO TURN IT INTO THE OPENING OF A CATASTROPHE. TO URIEL WATCHINGTHE PROGRESS OF PLANETARY HISTORY FROM THE SUN THE ONE RESULT WOULD BEJUST AS MUCH OF A COINCIDENCE AS THE OTHER.HAVING MADE THIS RATHER LOFTY COMPARISON I AM LESS UNEASY IN CALLINGATTENTION TO THE EXISTENCE OF LOW PEOPLE BY WHOSE INTERFERENCE HOWEVERLITTLE WE MAY LIKE IT THE COURSE OF THE WORLD IS VERY MUCH DETERMINED.IT WOULD BE WELL CERTAINLY IF WE COULD HELP TO REDUCE THEIR NUMBERAND SOMETHING MIGHT PERHAPS BE DONE BY NOT LIGHTLY GIVING OCCASION TOTHEIR EXISTENCE. SOCIALLY SPEAKING JOSHUA RIGG WOULD HAVE BEENGENERALLY PRONOUNCED A SUPERFLUITY. BUT THOSE WHO LIKE PETERFEATHERSTONE NEVER HAD A COPY OF THEMSELVES DEMANDED ARE THE VERY LASTTO WAIT FOR SUCH A REQUEST EITHER IN PROSE OR VERSE. THE COPY IN THISCASE BORE MORE OF OUTSIDE RESEMBLANCE TO THE MOTHER IN WHOSE SEXFROGFEATURES ACCOMPANIED WITH FRESHCOLORED CHEEKS AND A WELLROUNDEDFIGURE ARE COMPATIBLE WITH MUCH CHARM FOR A CERTAIN ORDER OF ADMIRERS.THE RESULT IS SOMETIMES A FROGFACED MALE DESIRABLE SURELY TO NOORDER OF INTELLIGENT BEINGS. ESPECIALLY WHEN HE IS SUDDENLY BROUGHTINTO EVIDENCE TO FRUSTRATE OTHER PEOPLES EXPECTATIONSTHE VERY LOWESTASPECT IN WHICH A SOCIAL SUPERFLUITY CAN PRESENT HIMSELF.BUT MR. RIGG FEATHERSTONES LOW CHARACTERISTICS WERE ALL OF THE SOBERWATERDRINKING KIND. FROM THE EARLIEST TO THE LATEST HOUR OF THE DAY HEWAS ALWAYS AS SLEEK NEAT AND COOL AS THE FROG HE RESEMBLED AND OLDPETER HAD SECRETLY CHUCKLED OVER AN OFFSHOOT ALMOST MORE CALCULATINGAND FAR MORE IMPERTURBABLE THAN HIMSELF. I WILL ADD THAT HISFINGERNAILS WERE SCRUPULOUSLY ATTENDED TO AND THAT HE MEANT TO MARRYA WELLEDUCATED YOUNG LADY AS YET UNSPECIFIED WHOSE PERSON WAS GOODAND WHOSE CONNECTIONS IN A SOLID MIDDLECLASS WAY WERE UNDENIABLE.THUS HIS NAILS AND MODESTY WERE COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF MOST GENTLEMENTHOUGH HIS AMBITION HAD BEEN EDUCATED ONLY BY THE OPPORTUNITIES OF ACLERK AND ACCOUNTANT IN THE SMALLER COMMERCIAL HOUSES OF A SEAPORT. HETHOUGHT THE RURAL FEATHERSTONES VERY SIMPLE ABSURD PEOPLE AND THEY INTHEIR TURN REGARDED HIS BRINGING UP IN A SEAPORT TOWN AS ANEXAGGERATION OF THE MONSTROSITY THAT THEIR BROTHER PETER AND STILLMORE PETERS PROPERTY SHOULD HAVE HAD SUCH BELONGINGS.THE GARDEN AND GRAVEL APPROACH AS SEEN FROM THE TWO WINDOWS OF THEWAINSCOTED PARLOR AT STONE COURT WERE NEVER IN BETTER TRIM THAN NOWWHEN MR. RIGG FEATHERSTONE STOOD WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM LOOKINGOUT ON THESE GROUNDS AS THEIR MASTER. BUT IT SEEMED DOUBTFUL WHETHER HELOOKED OUT FOR THE SAKE OF CONTEMPLATION OR OF TURNING HIS BACK TO APERSON WHO STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WITH HIS LEGS CONSIDERABLYAPART AND HIS HANDS IN HIS TROUSERPOCKETS A PERSON IN ALL RESPECTS ACONTRAST TO THE SLEEK AND COOL RIGG. HE WAS A MAN OBVIOUSLY ON THE WAYTOWARDS SIXTY VERY FLORID AND HAIRY WITH MUCH GRAY IN HIS BUSHYWHISKERS AND THICK CURLY HAIR A STOUTISH BODY WHICH SHOWED TODISADVANTAGE THE SOMEWHAT WORN JOININGS OF HIS CLOTHES AND THE AIR OFA SWAGGERER WHO WOULD AIM AT BEING NOTICEABLE EVEN AT A SHOW OFFIREWORKS REGARDING HIS OWN REMARKS ON ANY OTHER PERSONS PERFORMANCEAS LIKELY TO BE MORE INTERESTING THAN THE PERFORMANCE ITSELF.HIS NAME WAS JOHN RAFFLES AND HE SOMETIMES WROTE JOCOSELY W.A.G. AFTERHIS SIGNATURE OBSERVING WHEN HE DID SO THAT HE WAS ONCE TAUGHT BYLEONARD LAMB OF FINSBURY WHO WROTE B.A. AFTER HIS NAME AND THAT HERAFFLES ORIGINATED THE WITTICISM OF CALLING THAT CELEBRATED PRINCIPALBALAMB. SUCH WERE THE APPEARANCE AND MENTAL FLAVOR OF MR. RAFFLESBOTH OF WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE A STALE ODOR OF TRAVELLERS ROOMS IN THECOMMERCIAL HOTELS OF THAT PERIOD.COME NOW JOSH HE WAS SAYING IN A FULL RUMBLING TONE LOOK AT ITIN THIS LIGHT HERE IS YOUR POOR MOTHER GOING INTO THE VALE OF YEARSAND YOU COULD AFFORD SOMETHING HANDSOME NOW TO MAKE HER COMFORTABLE.NOT WHILE YOU LIVE. NOTHING WOULD MAKE HER COMFORTABLE WHILE YOULIVE RETURNED RIGG IN HIS COOL HIGH VOICE. WHAT I GIVE HER YOULLTAKE.YOU BEAR ME A GRUDGE JOSH THAT I KNOW. BUT COME NOWAS BETWEEN MANAND MANWITHOUT HUMBUGA LITTLE CAPITAL MIGHT ENABLE ME TO MAKE AFIRSTRATE THING OF THE SHOP. THE TOBACCO TRADE IS GROWING. I SHOULDCUT MY OWN NOSE OFF IN NOT DOING THE BEST I COULD AT IT. I SHOULD STICKTO IT LIKE A FLEA TO A FLEECE FOR MY OWN SAKE. I SHOULD ALWAYS BE ONTHE SPOT. AND NOTHING WOULD MAKE YOUR POOR MOTHER SO HAPPY. IVE PRETTYWELL DONE WITH MY WILD OATSTURNED FIFTYFIVE. I WANT TO SETTLE DOWN INMY CHIMNEYCORNER. AND IF I ONCE BUCKLED TO THE TOBACCO TRADE I COULDBRING AN AMOUNT OF BRAINS AND EXPERIENCE TO BEAR ON IT THAT WOULD NOTBE FOUND ELSEWHERE IN A HURRY. I DONT WANT TO BE BOTHERING YOU ONETIME AFTER ANOTHER BUT TO GET THINGS ONCE FOR ALL INTO THE RIGHTCHANNEL. CONSIDER THAT JOSHAS BETWEEN MAN AND MANAND WITH YOUR POORMOTHER TO BE MADE EASY FOR HER LIFE. I WAS ALWAYS FOND OF THE OLDWOMAN BY JOVEHAVE YOU DONE SAID MR. RIGG QUIETLY WITHOUT LOOKING AWAY FROM THEWINDOW.YES IVE DONE SAID RAFFLES TAKING HOLD OF HIS HAT WHICH STOODBEFORE HIM ON THE TABLE AND GIVING IT A SORT OF ORATORICAL PUSH.THEN JUST LISTEN TO ME. THE MORE YOU SAY ANYTHING THE LESS I SHALLBELIEVE IT. THE MORE YOU WANT ME TO DO A THING THE MORE REASON I SHALLHAVE FOR NEVER DOING IT. DO YOU THINK I MEAN TO FORGET YOUR KICKING MEWHEN I WAS A LAD AND EATING ALL THE BEST VICTUAL AWAY FROM ME AND MYMOTHER DO YOU THINK I FORGET YOUR ALWAYS COMING HOME TO SELL ANDPOCKET EVERYTHING AND GOING OFF AGAIN LEAVING US IN THE LURCH ISHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE YOU WHIPPED AT THE CARTTAIL. MY MOTHER WAS AFOOL TO YOU SHED NO RIGHT TO GIVE ME A FATHERINLAW AND SHES BEENPUNISHED FOR IT. SHE SHALL HAVE HER WEEKLY ALLOWANCE PAID AND NO MOREAND THAT SHALL BE STOPPED IF YOU DARE TO COME ON TO THESE PREMISESAGAIN OR TO COME INTO THIS COUNTRY AFTER ME AGAIN. THE NEXT TIME YOUSHOW YOURSELF INSIDE THE GATES HERE YOU SHALL BE DRIVEN OFF WITH THEDOGS AND THE WAGONERS WHIP.AS RIGG PRONOUNCED THE LAST WORDS HE TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT RAFFLESWITH HIS PROMINENT FROZEN EYES. THE CONTRAST WAS AS STRIKING AS ITCOULD HAVE BEEN EIGHTEEN YEARS BEFORE WHEN RIGG WAS A MOST UNENGAGINGKICKABLE BOY AND RAFFLES WAS THE RATHER THICKSET ADONIS OF BARROOMSAND BACKPARLORS. BUT THE ADVANTAGE NOW WAS ON THE SIDE OF RIGG ANDAUDITORS OF THIS CONVERSATION MIGHT PROBABLY HAVE EXPECTED THAT RAFFLESWOULD RETIRE WITH THE AIR OF A DEFEATED DOG. NOT AT ALL. HE MADE AGRIMACE WHICH WAS HABITUAL WITH HIM WHENEVER HE WAS OUT IN A GAMETHEN SUBSIDED INTO A LAUGH AND DREW A BRANDYFLASK FROM HIS POCKET.COME JOSH HE SAID IN A CAJOLING TONE GIVE US A SPOONFUL OFBRANDY AND A SOVEREIGN TO PAY THE WAY BACK AND ILL GO. HONOR BRIGHTILL GO LIKE A BULLET BY JOVEMIND SAID RIGG DRAWING OUT A BUNCH OF KEYS IF I EVER SEE YOUAGAIN I SHANT SPEAK TO YOU. I DONT OWN YOU ANY MORE THAN IF I SAW ACROW AND IF YOU WANT TO OWN ME YOULL GET NOTHING BY IT BUT ACHARACTER FOR BEING WHAT YOU AREA SPITEFUL BRASSY BULLYING ROGUE.THATS A PITY NOW JOSH SAID RAFFLES AFFECTING TO SCRATCH HIS HEADAND WRINKLE HIS BROWS UPWARD AS IF HE WERE NONPLUSSED. IM VERY FONDOF YOU BY JOVE I AM THERES NOTHING I LIKE BETTER THAN PLAGUINGYOUYOURE SO LIKE YOUR MOTHER AND I MUST DO WITHOUT IT. BUT THEBRANDY AND THE SOVEREIGNS A BARGAIN.HE JERKED FORWARD THE FLASK AND RIGG WENT TO A FINE OLD OAKEN BUREAUWITH HIS KEYS. BUT RAFFLES HAD REMINDED HIMSELF BY HIS MOVEMENT WITHTHE FLASK THAT IT HAD BECOME DANGEROUSLY LOOSE FROM ITS LEATHERCOVERING AND CATCHING SIGHT OF A FOLDED PAPER WHICH HAD FALLEN WITHINTHE FENDER HE TOOK IT UP AND SHOVED IT UNDER THE LEATHER SO AS TO MAKETHE GLASS FIRM.BY THAT TIME RIGG CAME FORWARD WITH A BRANDYBOTTLE FILLED THE FLASKAND HANDED RAFFLES A SOVEREIGN NEITHER LOOKING AT HIM NOR SPEAKING TOHIM. AFTER LOCKING UP THE BUREAU AGAIN HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW ANDGAZED OUT AS IMPASSIBLY AS HE HAD DONE AT THE BEGINNING OF THEINTERVIEW WHILE RAFFLES TOOK A SMALL ALLOWANCE FROM THE FLASK SCREWEDIT UP AND DEPOSITED IT IN HIS SIDEPOCKET WITH PROVOKING SLOWNESSMAKING A GRIMACE AT HIS STEPSONS BACK.FAREWELL JOSHAND IF FOREVER SAID RAFFLES TURNING BACK HIS HEAD ASHE OPENED THE DOOR.RIGG SAW HIM LEAVE THE GROUNDS AND ENTER THE LANE. THE GRAY DAY HADTURNED TO A LIGHT DRIZZLING RAIN WHICH FRESHENED THE HEDGEROWS AND THEGRASSY BORDERS OF THE BYROADS AND HASTENED THE LABORERS WHO WERELOADING THE LAST SHOCKS OF CORN. RAFFLES WALKING WITH THE UNEASY GAITOF A TOWN LOITERER OBLIGED TO DO A BIT OF COUNTRY JOURNEYING ON FOOTLOOKED AS INCONGRUOUS AMID THIS MOIST RURAL QUIET AND INDUSTRY AS IF HEHAD BEEN A BABOON ESCAPED FROM A MENAGERIE. BUT THERE WERE NONE TOSTARE AT HIM EXCEPT THE LONGWEANED CALVES AND NONE TO SHOW DISLIKE OFHIS APPEARANCE EXCEPT THE LITTLE WATERRATS WHICH RUSTLED AWAY AT HISAPPROACH.HE WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH WHEN HE GOT ON TO THE HIGHROAD TO BE OVERTAKENBY THE STAGECOACH WHICH CARRIED HIM TO BRASSING AND THERE HE TOOKTHE NEWMADE RAILWAY OBSERVING TO HIS FELLOWPASSENGERS THAT HECONSIDERED IT PRETTY WELL SEASONED NOW IT HAD DONE FOR HUSKISSON. MR.RAFFLES ON MOST OCCASIONS KEPT UP THE SENSE OF HAVING BEEN EDUCATED ATAN ACADEMY AND BEING ABLE IF HE CHOSE TO PASS WELL EVERYWHEREINDEED THERE WAS NOT ONE OF HIS FELLOWMEN WHOM HE DID NOT FEELHIMSELF IN A POSITION TO RIDICULE AND TORMENT CONFIDENT OF THEENTERTAINMENT WHICH HE THUS GAVE TO ALL THE REST OF THE COMPANY.HE PLAYED THIS PART NOW WITH AS MUCH SPIRIT AS IF HIS JOURNEY HAD BEENENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL RESORTING AT FREQUENT INTERVALS TO HIS FLASK. THEPAPER WITH WHICH HE HAD WEDGED IT WAS A LETTER SIGNED NICHOLASBULSTRODE BUT RAFFLES WAS NOT LIKELY TO DISTURB IT FROM ITS PRESENTUSEFUL POSITION.CHAPTER XLII.HOW MUCH METHINKS I COULD DESPISE THIS MANWERE I NOT BOUND IN CHARITY AGAINST ITSHAKESPEARE HENRY VIII.ONE OF THE PROFESSIONAL CALLS MADE BY LYDGATE SOON AFTER HIS RETURNFROM HIS WEDDINGJOURNEY WAS TO LOWICK MANOR IN CONSEQUENCE OF ALETTER WHICH HAD REQUESTED HIM TO FIX A TIME FOR HIS VISIT.MR. CASAUBON HAD NEVER PUT ANY QUESTION CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HISILLNESS TO LYDGATE NOR HAD HE EVEN TO DOROTHEA BETRAYED ANY ANXIETY ASTO HOW FAR IT MIGHT BE LIKELY TO CUT SHORT HIS LABORS OR HIS LIFE. ONTHIS POINT AS ON ALL OTHERS HE SHRANK FROM PITY AND IF THE SUSPICIONOF BEING PITIED FOR ANYTHING IN HIS LOT SURMISED OR KNOWN IN SPITE OFHIMSELF WAS EMBITTERING THE IDEA OF CALLING FORTH A SHOW OF COMPASSIONBY FRANKLY ADMITTING AN ALARM OR A SORROW WAS NECESSARILY INTOLERABLETO HIM. EVERY PROUD MIND KNOWS SOMETHING OF THIS EXPERIENCE ANDPERHAPS IT IS ONLY TO BE OVERCOME BY A SENSE OF FELLOWSHIP DEEP ENOUGHTO MAKE ALL EFFORTS AT ISOLATION SEEM MEAN AND PETTY INSTEAD OFEXALTING.BUT MR. CASAUBON WAS NOW BROODING OVER SOMETHING THROUGH WHICH THEQUESTION OF HIS HEALTH AND LIFE HAUNTED HIS SILENCE WITH A MOREHARASSING IMPORTUNITY EVEN THAN THROUGH THE AUTUMNAL UNRIPENESS OF HISAUTHORSHIP. IT IS TRUE THAT THIS LAST MIGHT BE CALLED HIS CENTRALAMBITION BUT THERE ARE SOME KINDS OF AUTHORSHIP IN WHICH BY FAR THELARGEST RESULT IS THE UNEASY SUSCEPTIBILITY ACCUMULATED IN THECONSCIOUSNESS OF THE AUTHORONE KNOWS OF THE RIVER BY A FEW STREAKSAMID A LONGGATHERED DEPOSIT OF UNCOMFORTABLE MUD. THAT WAS THE WAYWITH MR. CASAUBONS HARD INTELLECTUAL LABORS. THEIR MOST CHARACTERISTICRESULT WAS NOT THE KEY TO ALL MYTHOLOGIES BUT A MORBID CONSCIOUSNESSTHAT OTHERS DID NOT GIVE HIM THE PLACE WHICH HE HAD NOT DEMONSTRABLYMERITEDA PERPETUAL SUSPICIOUS CONJECTURE THAT THE VIEWS ENTERTAINED OFHIM WERE NOT TO HIS ADVANTAGEA MELANCHOLY ABSENCE OF PASSION IN HISEFFORTS AT ACHIEVEMENT AND A PASSIONATE RESISTANCE TO THE CONFESSIONTHAT HE HAD ACHIEVED NOTHING.THUS HIS INTELLECTUAL AMBITION WHICH SEEMED TO OTHERS TO HAVE ABSORBEDAND DRIED HIM WAS REALLY NO SECURITY AGAINST WOUNDS LEAST OF ALLAGAINST THOSE WHICH CAME FROM DOROTHEA. AND HE HAD BEGUN NOW TO FRAMEPOSSIBILITIES FOR THE FUTURE WHICH WERE SOMEHOW MORE EMBITTERING TO HIMTHAN ANYTHING HIS MIND HAD DWELT ON BEFORE.AGAINST CERTAIN FACTS HE WAS HELPLESS AGAINST WILL LADISLAWSEXISTENCE HIS DEFIANT STAY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF LOWICK AND HISFLIPPANT STATE OF MIND WITH REGARD TO THE POSSESSORS OF AUTHENTICWELLSTAMPED ERUDITION AGAINST DOROTHEAS NATURE ALWAYS TAKING ONSOME NEW SHAPE OF ARDENT ACTIVITY AND EVEN IN SUBMISSION AND SILENCECOVERING FERVID REASONS WHICH IT WAS AN IRRITATION TO THINK OF AGAINSTCERTAIN NOTIONS AND LIKINGS WHICH HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER MIND INRELATION TO SUBJECTS THAT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY DISCUSS WITH HER. THEREWAS NO DENYING THAT DOROTHEA WAS AS VIRTUOUS AND LOVELY A YOUNG LADY ASHE COULD HAVE OBTAINED FOR A WIFE BUT A YOUNG LADY TURNED OUT TO BESOMETHING MORE TROUBLESOME THAN HE HAD CONCEIVED. SHE NURSED HIM SHEREAD TO HIM SHE ANTICIPATED HIS WANTS AND WAS SOLICITOUS ABOUT HISFEELINGS BUT THERE HAD ENTERED INTO THE HUSBANDS MIND THE CERTAINTYTHAT SHE JUDGED HIM AND THAT HER WIFELY DEVOTEDNESS WAS LIKE APENITENTIAL EXPIATION OF UNBELIEVING THOUGHTSWAS ACCOMPANIED WITH APOWER OF COMPARISON BY WHICH HIMSELF AND HIS DOINGS WERE SEEN TOOLUMINOUSLY AS A PART OF THINGS IN GENERAL. HIS DISCONTENT PASSEDVAPORLIKE THROUGH ALL HER GENTLE LOVING MANIFESTATIONS AND CLUNG TOTHAT INAPPRECIATIVE WORLD WHICH SHE HAD ONLY BROUGHT NEARER TO HIM.POOR MR. CASAUBON THIS SUFFERING WAS THE HARDER TO BEAR BECAUSE ITSEEMED LIKE A BETRAYAL THE YOUNG CREATURE WHO HAD WORSHIPPED HIM WITHPERFECT TRUST HAD QUICKLY TURNED INTO THE CRITICAL WIFE AND EARLYINSTANCES OF CRITICISM AND RESENTMENT HAD MADE AN IMPRESSION WHICH NOTENDERNESS AND SUBMISSION AFTERWARDS COULD REMOVE. TO HIS SUSPICIOUSINTERPRETATION DOROTHEAS SILENCE NOW WAS A SUPPRESSED REBELLION AREMARK FROM HER WHICH HE HAD NOT IN ANY WAY ANTICIPATED WAS ANASSERTION OF CONSCIOUS SUPERIORITY HER GENTLE ANSWERS HAD ANIRRITATING CAUTIOUSNESS IN THEM AND WHEN SHE ACQUIESCED IT WAS ASELFAPPROVED EFFORT OF FORBEARANCE. THE TENACITY WITH WHICH HE STROVETO HIDE THIS INWARD DRAMA MADE IT THE MORE VIVID FOR HIM AS WE HEARWITH THE MORE KEENNESS WHAT WE WISH OTHERS NOT TO HEAR.INSTEAD OF WONDERING AT THIS RESULT OF MISERY IN MR. CASAUBON I THINKIT QUITE ORDINARY. WILL NOT A TINY SPECK VERY CLOSE TO OUR VISION BLOTOUT THE GLORY OF THE WORLD AND LEAVE ONLY A MARGIN BY WHICH WE SEE THEBLOT I KNOW NO SPECK SO TROUBLESOME AS SELF. AND WHO IF MR. CASAUBONHAD CHOSEN TO EXPOUND HIS DISCONTENTSHIS SUSPICIONS THAT HE WAS NOTANY LONGER ADORED WITHOUT CRITICISMCOULD HAVE DENIED THAT THEY WEREFOUNDED ON GOOD REASONS ON THE CONTRARY THERE WAS A STRONG REASON TOBE ADDED WHICH HE HAD NOT HIMSELF TAKEN EXPLICITLY INTOACCOUNTNAMELY THAT HE WAS NOT UNMIXEDLY ADORABLE. HE SUSPECTED THISHOWEVER AS HE SUSPECTED OTHER THINGS WITHOUT CONFESSING IT AND LIKETHE REST OF US FELT HOW SOOTHING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO HAVE ACOMPANION WHO WOULD NEVER FIND IT OUT.THIS SORE SUSCEPTIBILITY IN RELATION TO DOROTHEA WAS THOROUGHLYPREPARED BEFORE WILL LADISLAW HAD RETURNED TO LOWICK AND WHAT HADOCCURRED SINCE THEN HAD BROUGHT MR. CASAUBONS POWER OF SUSPICIOUSCONSTRUCTION INTO EXASPERATED ACTIVITY. TO ALL THE FACTS WHICH HE KNEWHE ADDED IMAGINARY FACTS BOTH PRESENT AND FUTURE WHICH BECAME MORE REALTO HIM THAN THOSE BECAUSE THEY CALLED UP A STRONGER DISLIKE A MOREPREDOMINATING BITTERNESS. SUSPICION AND JEALOUSY OF WILL LADISLAWSINTENTIONS SUSPICION AND JEALOUSY OF DOROTHEAS IMPRESSIONS WERECONSTANTLY AT THEIR WEAVING WORK. IT WOULD BE QUITE UNJUST TO HIM TOSUPPOSE THAT HE COULD HAVE ENTERED INTO ANY COARSE MISINTERPRETATION OFDOROTHEA HIS OWN HABITS OF MIND AND CONDUCT QUITE AS MUCH AS THE OPENELEVATION OF HER NATURE SAVED HIM FROM ANY SUCH MISTAKE. WHAT HE WASJEALOUS OF WAS HER OPINION THE SWAY THAT MIGHT BE GIVEN TO HER ARDENTMIND IN ITS JUDGMENTS AND THE FUTURE POSSIBILITIES TO WHICH THESEMIGHT LEAD HER. AS TO WILL THOUGH UNTIL HIS LAST DEFIANT LETTER HE HADNOTHING DEFINITE WHICH HE WOULD CHOOSE FORMALLY TO ALLEGE AGAINST HIMHE FELT HIMSELF WARRANTED IN BELIEVING THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF ANYDESIGN WHICH COULD FASCINATE A REBELLIOUS TEMPER AND AN UNDISCIPLINEDIMPULSIVENESS. HE WAS QUITE SURE THAT DOROTHEA WAS THE CAUSE OF WILLSRETURN FROM ROME AND HIS DETERMINATION TO SETTLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODAND HE WAS PENETRATING ENOUGH TO IMAGINE THAT DOROTHEA HAD INNOCENTLYENCOURAGED THIS COURSE. IT WAS AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE THAT SHE WAS READYTO BE ATTACHED TO WILL AND TO BE PLIANT TO HIS SUGGESTIONS THEY HADNEVER HAD A TTETTE WITHOUT HER BRINGING AWAY FROM IT SOME NEWTROUBLESOME IMPRESSION AND THE LAST INTERVIEW THAT MR. CASAUBON WASAWARE OF DOROTHEA ON RETURNING FROM FRESHITT HALL HAD FOR THE FIRSTTIME BEEN SILENT ABOUT HAVING SEEN WILL HAD LED TO A SCENE WHICHROUSED AN ANGRIER FEELING AGAINST THEM BOTH THAN HE HAD EVER KNOWNBEFORE. DOROTHEAS OUTPOURING OF HER NOTIONS ABOUT MONEY IN THEDARKNESS OF THE NIGHT HAD DONE NOTHING BUT BRING A MIXTURE OF MOREODIOUS FOREBODING INTO HER HUSBANDS MIND.AND THERE WAS THE SHOCK LATELY GIVEN TO HIS HEALTH ALWAYS SADLY PRESENTWITH HIM. HE WAS CERTAINLY MUCH REVIVED HE HAD RECOVERED ALL HIS USUALPOWER OF WORK THE ILLNESS MIGHT HAVE BEEN MERE FATIGUE AND THEREMIGHT STILL BE TWENTY YEARS OF ACHIEVEMENT BEFORE HIM WHICH WOULDJUSTIFY THE THIRTY YEARS OF PREPARATION. THAT PROSPECT WAS MADE THESWEETER BY A FLAVOR OF VENGEANCE AGAINST THE HASTY SNEERS OF CARP COMPANY FOR EVEN WHEN MR. CASAUBON WAS CARRYING HIS TAPER AMONG THETOMBS OF THE PAST THOSE MODERN FIGURES CAME ATHWART THE DIM LIGHT ANDINTERRUPTED HIS DILIGENT EXPLORATION. TO CONVINCE CARP OF HIS MISTAKESO THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO EAT HIS OWN WORDS WITH A GOOD DEAL OFINDIGESTION WOULD BE AN AGREEABLE ACCIDENT OF TRIUMPHANT AUTHORSHIPWHICH THE PROSPECT OF LIVING TO FUTURE AGES ON EARTH AND TO ALLETERNITY IN HEAVEN COULD NOT EXCLUDE FROM CONTEMPLATION. SINCE THUSTHE PREVISION OF HIS OWN UNENDING BLISS COULD NOT NULLIFY THE BITTERSAVORS OF IRRITATED JEALOUSY AND VINDICTIVENESS IT IS THE LESSSURPRISING THAT THE PROBABILITY OF A TRANSIENT EARTHLY BLISS FOR OTHERPERSONS WHEN HE HIMSELF SHOULD HAVE ENTERED INTO GLORY HAD NOT APOTENTLY SWEETENING EFFECT. IF THE TRUTH SHOULD BE THAT SOMEUNDERMINING DISEASE WAS AT WORK WITHIN HIM THERE MIGHT BE LARGEOPPORTUNITY FOR SOME PEOPLE TO BE THE HAPPIER WHEN HE WAS GONE AND IFONE OF THOSE PEOPLE SHOULD BE WILL LADISLAW MR. CASAUBON OBJECTED SOSTRONGLY THAT IT SEEMED AS IF THE ANNOYANCE WOULD MAKE PART OF HISDISEMBODIED EXISTENCE.THIS IS A VERY BARE AND THEREFORE A VERY INCOMPLETE WAY OF PUTTING THECASE. THE HUMAN SOUL MOVES IN MANY CHANNELS AND MR. CASAUBON WE KNOWHAD A SENSE OF RECTITUDE AND AN HONORABLE PRIDE IN SATISFYING THEREQUIREMENTS OF HONOR WHICH COMPELLED HIM TO FIND OTHER REASONS FORHIS CONDUCT THAN THOSE OF JEALOUSY AND VINDICTIVENESS. THE WAY IN WHICHMR. CASAUBON PUT THE CASE WAS THISIN MARRYING DOROTHEA BROOKE I HADTO CARE FOR HER WELLBEING IN CASE OF MY DEATH. BUT WELLBEING IS NOTTO BE SECURED BY AMPLE INDEPENDENT POSSESSION OF PROPERTY ON THECONTRARY OCCASIONS MIGHT ARISE IN WHICH SUCH POSSESSION MIGHT EXPOSEHER TO THE MORE DANGER. SHE IS READY PREY TO ANY MAN WHO KNOWS HOW TOPLAY ADROITLY EITHER ON HER AFFECTIONATE ARDOR OR HER QUIXOTICENTHUSIASM AND A MAN STANDS BY WITH THAT VERY INTENTION IN HIS MINDAMAN WITH NO OTHER PRINCIPLE THAN TRANSIENT CAPRICE AND WHO HAS APERSONAL ANIMOSITY TOWARDS MEI AM SURE OF ITAN ANIMOSITY WHICH IS FEDBY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS INGRATITUDE AND WHICH HE HAS CONSTANTLYVENTED IN RIDICULE OF WHICH I AM AS WELL ASSURED AS IF I HAD HEARD IT.EVEN IF I LIVE I SHALL NOT BE WITHOUT UNEASINESS AS TO WHAT HE MAYATTEMPT THROUGH INDIRECT INFLUENCE. THIS MAN HAS GAINED DOROTHEAS EARHE HAS FASCINATED HER ATTENTION HE HAS EVIDENTLY TRIED TO IMPRESS HERMIND WITH THE NOTION THAT HE HAS CLAIMS BEYOND ANYTHING I HAVE DONE FORHIM. IF I DIEAND HE IS WAITING HERE ON THE WATCH FOR THATHE WILLPERSUADE HER TO MARRY HIM. THAT WOULD BE CALAMITY FOR HER AND SUCCESSFOR HIM. SHE WOULD NOT THINK IT CALAMITY HE WOULD MAKE HER BELIEVEANYTHING SHE HAS A TENDENCY TO IMMODERATE ATTACHMENT WHICH SHEINWARDLY REPROACHES ME FOR NOT RESPONDING TO AND ALREADY HER MIND ISOCCUPIED WITH HIS FORTUNES. HE THINKS OF AN EASY CONQUEST AND OFENTERING INTO MY NEST. THAT I WILL HINDER SUCH A MARRIAGE WOULD BEFATAL TO DOROTHEA. HAS HE EVER PERSISTED IN ANYTHING EXCEPT FROMCONTRADICTION IN KNOWLEDGE HE HAS ALWAYS TRIED TO BE SHOWY AT SMALLCOST. IN RELIGION HE COULD BE AS LONG AS IT SUITED HIM THE FACILEECHO OF DOROTHEAS VAGARIES. WHEN WAS SCIOLISM EVER DISSOCIATED FROMLAXITY I UTTERLY DISTRUST HIS MORALS AND IT IS MY DUTY TO HINDER TOTHE UTMOST THE FULFILMENT OF HIS DESIGNS.THE ARRANGEMENTS MADE BY MR. CASAUBON ON HIS MARRIAGE LEFT STRONGMEASURES OPEN TO HIM BUT IN RUMINATING ON THEM HIS MIND INEVITABLYDWELT SO MUCH ON THE PROBABILITIES OF HIS OWN LIFE THAT THE LONGING TOGET THE NEAREST POSSIBLE CALCULATION HAD AT LAST OVERCOME HIS PROUDRETICENCE AND HAD DETERMINED HIM TO ASK LYDGATES OPINION AS TO THENATURE OF HIS ILLNESS.HE HAD MENTIONED TO DOROTHEA THAT LYDGATE WAS COMING BY APPOINTMENT ATHALFPAST THREE AND IN ANSWER TO HER ANXIOUS QUESTION WHETHER HE HADFELT ILL REPLIEDNO I MERELY WISH TO HAVE HIS OPINION CONCERNINGSOME HABITUAL SYMPTOMS. YOU NEED NOT SEE HIM MY DEAR. I SHALL GIVEORDERS THAT HE MAY BE SENT TO ME IN THE YEWTREE WALK WHERE I SHALL BETAKING MY USUAL EXERCISE.WHEN LYDGATE ENTERED THE YEWTREE WALK HE SAW MR. CASAUBON SLOWLYRECEDING WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM ACCORDING TO HIS HABIT AND HIS HEADBENT FORWARD. IT WAS A LOVELY AFTERNOON THE LEAVES FROM THE LOFTYLIMES WERE FALLING SILENTLY ACROSS THE SOMBRE EVERGREENS WHILE THELIGHTS AND SHADOWS SLEPT SIDE BY SIDE THERE WAS NO SOUND BUT THECAWING OF THE ROOKS WHICH TO THE ACCUSTOMED EAR IS A LULLABY OR THATLAST SOLEMN LULLABY A DIRGE. LYDGATE CONSCIOUS OF AN ENERGETIC FRAMEIN ITS PRIME FELT SOME COMPASSION WHEN THE FIGURE WHICH HE WAS LIKELYSOON TO OVERTAKE TURNED ROUND AND IN ADVANCING TOWARDS HIM SHOWED MOREMARKEDLY THAN EVER THE SIGNS OF PREMATURE AGETHE STUDENTS BENTSHOULDERS THE EMACIATED LIMBS AND THE MELANCHOLY LINES OF THE MOUTH.POOR FELLOW HE THOUGHT SOME MEN WITH HIS YEARS ARE LIKE LIONS ONECAN TELL NOTHING OF THEIR AGE EXCEPT THAT THEY ARE FULL GROWN.MR. LYDGATE SAID MR. CASAUBON WITH HIS INVARIABLY POLITE AIR I AMEXCEEDINGLY OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR PUNCTUALITY. WE WILL IF YOUPLEASE CARRY ON OUR CONVERSATION IN WALKING TO AND FRO.I HOPE YOUR WISH TO SEE ME IS NOT DUE TO THE RETURN OF UNPLEASANTSYMPTOMS SAID LYDGATE FILLING UP A PAUSE.NOT IMMEDIATELYNO. IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT WISH I MUSTMENTIONWHAT IT WERE OTHERWISE NEEDLESS TO REFER TOTHAT MY LIFE ONALL COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS INSIGNIFICANT DERIVES A POSSIBLE IMPORTANCEFROM THE INCOMPLETENESS OF LABORS WHICH HAVE EXTENDED THROUGH ALL ITSBEST YEARS. IN SHORT I HAVE LONG HAD ON HAND A WORK WHICH I WOULD FAINLEAVE BEHIND ME IN SUCH A STATE AT LEAST THAT IT MIGHT BE COMMITTEDTO THE PRESS BYOTHERS. WERE I ASSURED THAT THIS IS THE UTMOST I CANREASONABLY EXPECT THAT ASSURANCE WOULD BE A USEFUL CIRCUMSCRIPTION OFMY ATTEMPTS AND A GUIDE IN BOTH THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVEDETERMINATION OF MY COURSE.HERE MR. CASAUBON PAUSED REMOVED ONE HAND FROM HIS BACK AND THRUST ITBETWEEN THE BUTTONS OF HIS SINGLEBREASTED COAT. TO A MIND LARGELYINSTRUCTED IN THE HUMAN DESTINY HARDLY ANYTHING COULD BE MOREINTERESTING THAN THE INWARD CONFLICT IMPLIED IN HIS FORMAL MEASUREDADDRESS DELIVERED WITH THE USUAL SINGSONG AND MOTION OF THE HEAD.NAY ARE THERE MANY SITUATIONS MORE SUBLIMELY TRAGIC THAN THE STRUGGLEOF THE SOUL WITH THE DEMAND TO RENOUNCE A WORK WHICH HAS BEEN ALL THESIGNIFICANCE OF ITS LIFEA SIGNIFICANCE WHICH IS TO VANISH AS THEWATERS WHICH COME AND GO WHERE NO MAN HAS NEED OF THEM BUT THERE WASNOTHING TO STRIKE OTHERS AS SUBLIME ABOUT MR. CASAUBON AND LYDGATEWHO HAD SOME CONTEMPT AT HAND FOR FUTILE SCHOLARSHIP FELT A LITTLEAMUSEMENT MINGLING WITH HIS PITY. HE WAS AT PRESENT TOO ILL ACQUAINTEDWITH DISASTER TO ENTER INTO THE PATHOS OF A LOT WHERE EVERYTHING ISBELOW THE LEVEL OF TRAGEDY EXCEPT THE PASSIONATE EGOISM OF THESUFFERER.YOU REFER TO THE POSSIBLE HINDRANCES FROM WANT OF HEALTH HE SAIDWISHING TO HELP FORWARD MR. CASAUBONS PURPOSE WHICH SEEMED TO BECLOGGED BY SOME HESITATION.I DO. YOU HAVE NOT IMPLIED TO ME THAT THE SYMPTOMS WHICHI AM BOUND TOTESTIFYYOU WATCHED WITH SCRUPULOUS CARE WERE THOSE OF A FATALDISEASE. BUT WERE IT SO MR. LYDGATE I SHOULD DESIRE TO KNOW THE TRUTHWITHOUT RESERVATION AND I APPEAL TO YOU FOR AN EXACT STATEMENT OF YOURCONCLUSIONS I REQUEST IT AS A FRIENDLY SERVICE. IF YOU CAN TELL METHAT MY LIFE IS NOT THREATENED BY ANYTHING ELSE THAN ORDINARYCASUALTIES I SHALL REJOICE ON GROUNDS WHICH I HAVE ALREADY INDICATED.IF NOT KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO ME.THEN I CAN NO LONGER HESITATE AS TO MY COURSE SAID LYDGATE BUT THEFIRST THING I MUST IMPRESS ON YOU IS THAT MY CONCLUSIONS ARE DOUBLYUNCERTAINUNCERTAIN NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF MY FALLIBILITY BUT BECAUSEDISEASES OF THE HEART ARE EMINENTLY DIFFICULT TO FOUND PREDICTIONS ON.IN ANY CASE ONE CAN HARDLY INCREASE APPRECIABLY THE TREMENDOUSUNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.MR. CASAUBON WINCED PERCEPTIBLY BUT BOWED.I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM WHAT IS CALLED FATTYDEGENERATION OF THE HEART A DISEASE WHICH WAS FIRST DIVINED ANDEXPLORED BY LAENNEC THE MAN WHO GAVE US THE STETHOSCOPE NOT SO VERYMANY YEARS AGO. A GOOD DEAL OF EXPERIENCEA MORE LENGTHENEDOBSERVATIONIS WANTING ON THE SUBJECT. BUT AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE SAID ITIS MY DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT DEATH FROM THIS DISEASE IS OFTEN SUDDEN. ATTHE SAME TIME NO SUCH RESULT CAN BE PREDICTED. YOUR CONDITION MAY BECONSISTENT WITH A TOLERABLY COMFORTABLE LIFE FOR ANOTHER FIFTEEN YEARSOR EVEN MORE. I COULD ADD NO INFORMATION TO THIS BEYOND ANATOMICAL ORMEDICAL DETAILS WHICH WOULD LEAVE EXPECTATION AT PRECISELY THE SAMEPOINT. LYDGATES INSTINCT WAS FINE ENOUGH TO TELL HIM THAT PLAINSPEECH QUITE FREE FROM OSTENTATIOUS CAUTION WOULD BE FELT BY MR.CASAUBON AS A TRIBUTE OF RESPECT.I THANK YOU MR. LYDGATE SAID MR. CASAUBON AFTER A MOMENTS PAUSE.ONE THING MORE I HAVE STILL TO ASK DID YOU COMMUNICATE WHAT YOU HAVENOW TOLD ME TO MRS. CASAUBONPARTLYI MEAN AS TO THE POSSIBLE ISSUES. LYDGATE WAS GOING TOEXPLAIN WHY HE HAD TOLD DOROTHEA BUT MR. CASAUBON WITH ANUNMISTAKABLE DESIRE TO END THE CONVERSATION WAVED HIS HAND SLIGHTLYAND SAID AGAIN I THANK YOU PROCEEDING TO REMARK ON THE RARE BEAUTYOF THE DAY.LYDGATE CERTAIN THAT HIS PATIENT WISHED TO BE ALONE SOON LEFT HIMAND THE BLACK FIGURE WITH HANDS BEHIND AND HEAD BENT FORWARD CONTINUEDTO PACE THE WALK WHERE THE DARK YEWTREES GAVE HIM A MUTE COMPANIONSHIPIN MELANCHOLY AND THE LITTLE SHADOWS OF BIRD OR LEAF THAT FLEETEDACROSS THE ISLES OF SUNLIGHT STOLE ALONG IN SILENCE AS IN THE PRESENCEOF A SORROW. HERE WAS A MAN WHO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME FOUND HIMSELFLOOKING INTO THE EYES OF DEATHWHO WAS PASSING THROUGH ONE OF THOSERARE MOMENTS OF EXPERIENCE WHEN WE FEEL THE TRUTH OF A COMMONPLACEWHICH IS AS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE CALL KNOWING IT AS THE VISION OFWATERS UPON THE EARTH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE DELIRIOUS VISION OF THEWATER WHICH CANNOT BE HAD TO COOL THE BURNING TONGUE. WHEN THECOMMONPLACE WE MUST ALL DIE TRANSFORMS ITSELF SUDDENLY INTO THE ACUTECONSCIOUSNESS I MUST DIEAND SOON THEN DEATH GRAPPLES US AND HISFINGERS ARE CRUEL AFTERWARDS HE MAY COME TO FOLD US IN HIS ARMS ASOUR MOTHER DID AND OUR LAST MOMENT OF DIM EARTHLY DISCERNING MAY BELIKE THE FIRST. TO MR. CASAUBON NOW IT WAS AS IF HE SUDDENLY FOUNDHIMSELF ON THE DARK RIVERBRINK AND HEARD THE PLASH OF THE ONCOMINGOAR NOT DISCERNING THE FORMS BUT EXPECTING THE SUMMONS. IN SUCH ANHOUR THE MIND DOES NOT CHANGE ITS LIFELONG BIAS BUT CARRIES IT ONWARDIN IMAGINATION TO THE OTHER SIDE OF DEATH GAZING BACKWARDPERHAPS WITHTHE DIVINE CALM OF BENEFICENCE PERHAPS WITH THE PETTY ANXIETIES OFSELFASSERTION. WHAT WAS MR. CASAUBONS BIAS HIS ACTS WILL GIVE US ACLEW TO. HE HELD HIMSELF TO BE WITH SOME PRIVATE SCHOLARLYRESERVATIONS A BELIEVING CHRISTIAN AS TO ESTIMATES OF THE PRESENT ANDHOPES OF THE FUTURE. BUT WHAT WE STRIVE TO GRATIFY THOUGH WE MAY CALLIT A DISTANT HOPE IS AN IMMEDIATE DESIRE THE FUTURE ESTATE FOR WHICHMEN DRUDGE UP CITY ALLEYS EXISTS ALREADY IN THEIR IMAGINATION AND LOVE.AND MR. CASAUBONS IMMEDIATE DESIRE WAS NOT FOR DIVINE COMMUNION ANDLIGHT DIVESTED OF EARTHLY CONDITIONS HIS PASSIONATE LONGINGS POORMAN CLUNG LOW AND MISTLIKE IN VERY SHADY PLACES.DOROTHEA HAD BEEN AWARE WHEN LYDGATE HAD RIDDEN AWAY AND SHE HADSTEPPED INTO THE GARDEN WITH THE IMPULSE TO GO AT ONCE TO HER HUSBAND.BUT SHE HESITATED FEARING TO OFFEND HIM BY OBTRUDING HERSELF FOR HERARDOR CONTINUALLY REPULSED SERVED WITH HER INTENSE MEMORY TOHEIGHTEN HER DREAD AS THWARTED ENERGY SUBSIDES INTO A SHUDDER AND SHEWANDERED SLOWLY ROUND THE NEARER CLUMPS OF TREES UNTIL SHE SAW HIMADVANCING. THEN SHE WENT TOWARDS HIM AND MIGHT HAVE REPRESENTED AHEAVENSENT ANGEL COMING WITH A PROMISE THAT THE SHORT HOURS REMAININGSHOULD YET BE FILLED WITH THAT FAITHFUL LOVE WHICH CLINGS THE CLOSER TOA COMPREHENDED GRIEF. HIS GLANCE IN REPLY TO HERS WAS SO CHILL THAT SHEFELT HER TIMIDITY INCREASED YET SHE TURNED AND PASSED HER HAND THROUGHHIS ARM.MR. CASAUBON KEPT HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM AND ALLOWED HER PLIANT ARM TOCLING WITH DIFFICULTY AGAINST HIS RIGID ARM.THERE WAS SOMETHING HORRIBLE TO DOROTHEA IN THE SENSATION WHICH THISUNRESPONSIVE HARDNESS INFLICTED ON HER. THAT IS A STRONG WORD BUT NOTTOO STRONG IT IS IN THESE ACTS CALLED TRIVIALITIES THAT THE SEEDS OFJOY ARE FOREVER WASTED UNTIL MEN AND WOMEN LOOK ROUND WITH HAGGARDFACES AT THE DEVASTATION THEIR OWN WASTE HAS MADE AND SAY THE EARTHBEARS NO HARVEST OF SWEETNESSCALLING THEIR DENIAL KNOWLEDGE. YOU MAYASK WHY IN THE NAME OF MANLINESS MR. CASAUBON SHOULD HAVE BEHAVED INTHAT WAY. CONSIDER THAT HIS WAS A MIND WHICH SHRANK FROM PITY HAVE YOUEVER WATCHED IN SUCH A MIND THE EFFECT OF A SUSPICION THAT WHAT ISPRESSING IT AS A GRIEF MAY BE REALLY A SOURCE OF CONTENTMENT EITHERACTUAL OR FUTURE TO THE BEING WHO ALREADY OFFENDS BY PITYING BESIDESHE KNEW LITTLE OF DOROTHEAS SENSATIONS AND HAD NOT REFLECTED THAT ONSUCH AN OCCASION AS THE PRESENT THEY WERE COMPARABLE IN STRENGTH TO HISOWN SENSIBILITIES ABOUT CARPS CRITICISMS.DOROTHEA DID NOT WITHDRAW HER ARM BUT SHE COULD NOT VENTURE TO SPEAK.MR. CASAUBON DID NOT SAY I WISH TO BE ALONE BUT HE DIRECTED HISSTEPS IN SILENCE TOWARDS THE HOUSE AND AS THEY ENTERED BY THE GLASSDOOR ON THIS EASTERN SIDE DOROTHEA WITHDREW HER ARM AND LINGERED ONTHE MATTING THAT SHE MIGHT LEAVE HER HUSBAND QUITE FREE. HE ENTEREDTHE LIBRARY AND SHUT HIMSELF IN ALONE WITH HIS SORROW.SHE WENT UP TO HER BOUDOIR. THE OPEN BOWWINDOW LET IN THE SERENE GLORYOF THE AFTERNOON LYING IN THE AVENUE WHERE THE LIMETREES CAST LONGSHADOWS. BUT DOROTHEA KNEW NOTHING OF THE SCENE. SHE THREW HERSELF ON ACHAIR NOT HEEDING THAT SHE WAS IN THE DAZZLING SUNRAYS IF THERE WEREDISCOMFORT IN THAT HOW COULD SHE TELL THAT IT WAS NOT PART OF HERINWARD MISERYSHE WAS IN THE REACTION OF A REBELLIOUS ANGER STRONGER THAN ANY SHE HADFELT SINCE HER MARRIAGE. INSTEAD OF TEARS THERE CAME WORDSWHAT HAVE I DONEWHAT AM ITHAT HE SHOULD TREAT ME SO HE NEVER KNOWSWHAT IS IN MY MINDHE NEVER CARES. WHAT IS THE USE OF ANYTHING I DO HEWISHES HE HAD NEVER MARRIED ME.SHE BEGAN TO HEAR HERSELF AND WAS CHECKED INTO STILLNESS. LIKE ONE WHOHAS LOST HIS WAY AND IS WEARY SHE SAT AND SAW AS IN ONE GLANCE ALL THEPATHS OF HER YOUNG HOPE WHICH SHE SHOULD NEVER FIND AGAIN. AND JUST ASCLEARLY IN THE MISERABLE LIGHT SHE SAW HER OWN AND HER HUSBANDSSOLITUDEHOW THEY WALKED APART SO THAT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO SURVEY HIM.IF HE HAD DRAWN HER TOWARDS HIM SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE SURVEYEDHIMNEVER HAVE SAID IS HE WORTH LIVING FOR BUT WOULD HAVE FELT HIMSIMPLY A PART OF HER OWN LIFE. NOW SHE SAID BITTERLY IT IS HIS FAULTNOT MINE. IN THE JAR OF HER WHOLE BEING PITY WAS OVERTHROWN. WAS ITHER FAULT THAT SHE HAD BELIEVED IN HIMHAD BELIEVED IN HISWORTHINESSAND WHAT EXACTLY WAS HE SHE WAS ABLE ENOUGH TO ESTIMATEHIMSHE WHO WAITED ON HIS GLANCES WITH TREMBLING AND SHUT HER BESTSOUL IN PRISON PAYING IT ONLY HIDDEN VISITS THAT SHE MIGHT BE PETTYENOUGH TO PLEASE HIM. IN SUCH A CRISIS AS THIS SOME WOMEN BEGIN TOHATE.THE SUN WAS LOW WHEN DOROTHEA WAS THINKING THAT SHE WOULD NOT GO DOWNAGAIN BUT WOULD SEND A MESSAGE TO HER HUSBAND SAYING THAT SHE WAS NOTWELL AND PREFERRED REMAINING UPSTAIRS. SHE HAD NEVER DELIBERATELYALLOWED HER RESENTMENT TO GOVERN HER IN THIS WAY BEFORE BUT SHEBELIEVED NOW THAT SHE COULD NOT SEE HIM AGAIN WITHOUT TELLING HIM THETRUTH ABOUT HER FEELING AND SHE MUST WAIT TILL SHE COULD DO IT WITHOUTINTERRUPTION. HE MIGHT WONDER AND BE HURT AT HER MESSAGE. IT WAS GOODTHAT HE SHOULD WONDER AND BE HURT. HER ANGER SAID AS ANGER IS APT TOSAY THAT GOD WAS WITH HERTHAT ALL HEAVEN THOUGH IT WERE CROWDED WITHSPIRITS WATCHING THEM MUST BE ON HER SIDE. SHE HAD DETERMINED TO RINGHER BELL WHEN THERE CAME A RAP AT THE DOOR.MR. CASAUBON HAD SENT TO SAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE HIS DINNER IN THELIBRARY. HE WISHED TO BE QUITE ALONE THIS EVENING BEING MUCH OCCUPIED.I SHALL NOT DINE THEN TANTRIPP.OH MADAM LET ME BRING YOU A LITTLE SOMETHINGNO I AM NOT WELL. GET EVERYTHING READY IN MY DRESSING ROOM BUT PRAYDO NOT DISTURB ME AGAIN.DOROTHEA SAT ALMOST MOTIONLESS IN HER MEDITATIVE STRUGGLE WHILE THEEVENING SLOWLY DEEPENED INTO NIGHT. BUT THE STRUGGLE CHANGEDCONTINUALLY AS THAT OF A MAN WHO BEGINS WITH A MOVEMENT TOWARDSSTRIKING AND ENDS WITH CONQUERING HIS DESIRE TO STRIKE. THE ENERGY THATWOULD ANIMATE A CRIME IS NOT MORE THAN IS WANTED TO INSPIRE A RESOLVEDSUBMISSION WHEN THE NOBLE HABIT OF THE SOUL REASSERTS ITSELF. THATTHOUGHT WITH WHICH DOROTHEA HAD GONE OUT TO MEET HER HUSBANDHERCONVICTION THAT HE HAD BEEN ASKING ABOUT THE POSSIBLE ARREST OF ALL HISWORK AND THAT THE ANSWER MUST HAVE WRUNG HIS HEART COULD NOT BE LONGWITHOUT RISING BESIDE THE IMAGE OF HIM LIKE A SHADOWY MONITOR LOOKINGAT HER ANGER WITH SAD REMONSTRANCE. IT COST HER A LITANY OF PICTUREDSORROWS AND OF SILENT CRIES THAT SHE MIGHT BE THE MERCY FOR THOSESORROWSBUT THE RESOLVED SUBMISSION DID COME AND WHEN THE HOUSE WASSTILL AND SHE KNEW THAT IT WAS NEAR THE TIME WHEN MR. CASAUBONHABITUALLY WENT TO REST SHE OPENED HER DOOR GENTLY AND STOOD OUTSIDEIN THE DARKNESS WAITING FOR HIS COMING UPSTAIRS WITH A LIGHT IN HISHAND. IF HE DID NOT COME SOON SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD GO DOWN ANDEVEN RISK INCURRING ANOTHER PANG. SHE WOULD NEVER AGAIN EXPECT ANYTHINGELSE. BUT SHE DID HEAR THE LIBRARY DOOR OPEN AND SLOWLY THE LIGHTADVANCED UP THE STAIRCASE WITHOUT NOISE FROM THE FOOTSTEPS ON THECARPET. WHEN HER HUSBAND STOOD OPPOSITE TO HER SHE SAW THAT HIS FACEWAS MORE HAGGARD. HE STARTED SLIGHTLY ON SEEING HER AND SHE LOOKED UPAT HIM BESEECHINGLY WITHOUT SPEAKING.DOROTHEA HE SAID WITH A GENTLE SURPRISE IN HIS TONE. WERE YOUWAITING FOR MEYES I DID NOT LIKE TO DISTURB YOU.COME MY DEAR COME. YOU ARE YOUNG AND NEED NOT TO EXTEND YOUR LIFEBY WATCHING.WHEN THE KIND QUIET MELANCHOLY OF THAT SPEECH FELL ON DOROTHEAS EARSSHE FELT SOMETHING LIKE THE THANKFULNESS THAT MIGHT WELL UP IN US IF WEHAD NARROWLY ESCAPED HURTING A LAMED CREATURE. SHE PUT HER HAND INTOHER HUSBANDS AND THEY WENT ALONG THE BROAD CORRIDOR TOGETHER.BOOK V.THE DEAD HAND.CHAPTER XLIII.THIS FIGURE HATH HIGH PRICE T WAS WROUGHT WITH LOVEAGES AGO IN FINEST IVORYNOUGHT MODISH IN IT PURE AND NOBLE LINESOF GENEROUS WOMANHOOD THAT FITS ALL TIMETHAT TOO IS COSTLY WARE MAJOLICAOF DEFT DESIGN TO PLEASE A LORDLY EYETHE SMILE YOU SEE IS PERFECTWONDERFULAS MERE FAIENCE A TABLE ORNAMENTTO SUIT THE RICHEST MOUNTING.DOROTHEA SELDOM LEFT HOME WITHOUT HER HUSBAND BUT SHE DID OCCASIONALLYDRIVE INTO MIDDLEMARCH ALONE ON LITTLE ERRANDS OF SHOPPING OR CHARITYSUCH AS OCCUR TO EVERY LADY OF ANY WEALTH WHEN SHE LIVES WITHIN THREEMILES OF A TOWN. TWO DAYS AFTER THAT SCENE IN THE YEWTREE WALK SHEDETERMINED TO USE SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY IN ORDER IF POSSIBLE TO SEELYDGATE AND LEARN FROM HIM WHETHER HER HUSBAND HAD REALLY FELT ANYDEPRESSING CHANGE OF SYMPTOMS WHICH HE WAS CONCEALING FROM HER ANDWHETHER HE HAD INSISTED ON KNOWING THE UTMOST ABOUT HIMSELF. SHE FELTALMOST GUILTY IN ASKING FOR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HIM FROM ANOTHER BUT THEDREAD OF BEING WITHOUT ITTHE DREAD OF THAT IGNORANCE WHICH WOULD MAKEHER UNJUST OR HARDOVERCAME EVERY SCRUPLE. THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOMECRISIS IN HER HUSBANDS MIND SHE WAS CERTAIN HE HAD THE VERY NEXT DAYBEGUN A NEW METHOD OF ARRANGING HIS NOTES AND HAD ASSOCIATED HER QUITENEWLY IN CARRYING OUT HIS PLAN. POOR DOROTHEA NEEDED TO LAY UP STORESOF PATIENCE.IT WAS ABOUT FOUR OCLOCK WHEN SHE DROVE TO LYDGATES HOUSE IN LOWICKGATE WISHING IN HER IMMEDIATE DOUBT OF FINDING HIM AT HOME THAT SHEHAD WRITTEN BEFOREHAND. AND HE WAS NOT AT HOME.IS MRS. LYDGATE AT HOME SAID DOROTHEA WHO HAD NEVER THAT SHE KNEWOF SEEN ROSAMOND BUT NOW REMEMBERED THE FACT OF THE MARRIAGE. YESMRS. LYDGATE WAS AT HOME.I WILL GO IN AND SPEAK TO HER IF SHE WILL ALLOW ME. WILL YOU ASK HERIF SHE CAN SEE MESEE MRS. CASAUBON FOR A FEW MINUTESWHEN THE SERVANT HAD GONE TO DELIVER THAT MESSAGE DOROTHEA COULD HEARSOUNDS OF MUSIC THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOWA FEW NOTES FROM A MANS VOICEAND THEN A PIANO BURSTING INTO ROULADES. BUT THE ROULADES BROKE OFFSUDDENLY AND THEN THE SERVANT CAME BACK SAYING THAT MRS. LYDGATE WOULDBE HAPPY TO SEE MRS. CASAUBON.WHEN THE DRAWINGROOM DOOR OPENED AND DOROTHEA ENTERED THERE WAS ASORT OF CONTRAST NOT INFREQUENT IN COUNTRY LIFE WHEN THE HABITS OF THEDIFFERENT RANKS WERE LESS BLENT THAN NOW. LET THOSE WHO KNOW TELL USEXACTLY WHAT STUFF IT WAS THAT DOROTHEA WORE IN THOSE DAYS OF MILDAUTUMNTHAT THIN WHITE WOOLLEN STUFF SOFT TO THE TOUCH AND SOFT TO THEEYE. IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN LATELY WASHED AND TO SMELL OF THESWEET HEDGESWAS ALWAYS IN THE SHAPE OF A PELISSE WITH SLEEVES HANGINGALL OUT OF THE FASHION. YET IF SHE HAD ENTERED BEFORE A STILL AUDIENCEAS IMOGENE OR CATOS DAUGHTER THE DRESS MIGHT HAVE SEEMED RIGHTENOUGH THE GRACE AND DIGNITY WERE IN HER LIMBS AND NECK AND ABOUT HERSIMPLY PARTED HAIR AND CANDID EYES THE LARGE ROUND POKE WHICH WAS THENIN THE FATE OF WOMEN SEEMED NO MORE ODD AS A HEADDRESS THAN THE GOLDTRENCHER WE CALL A HALO. BY THE PRESENT AUDIENCE OF TWO PERSONS NODRAMATIC HEROINE COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED WITH MORE INTEREST THAN MRS.CASAUBON. TO ROSAMOND SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE COUNTY DIVINITIES NOT MIXINGWITH MIDDLEMARCH MORTALITY WHOSE SLIGHTEST MARKS OF MANNER ORAPPEARANCE WERE WORTHY OF HER STUDY MOREOVER ROSAMOND WAS NOT WITHOUTSATISFACTION THAT MRS. CASAUBON SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF STUDYINGHER. WHAT IS THE USE OF BEING EXQUISITE IF YOU ARE NOT SEEN BY THEBEST JUDGES AND SINCE ROSAMOND HAD RECEIVED THE HIGHEST COMPLIMENTS ATSIR GODWIN LYDGATES SHE FELT QUITE CONFIDENT OF THE IMPRESSION SHEMUST MAKE ON PEOPLE OF GOOD BIRTH. DOROTHEA PUT OUT HER HAND WITH HERUSUAL SIMPLE KINDNESS AND LOOKED ADMIRINGLY AT LYDGATES LOVELYBRIDEAWARE THAT THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN STANDING AT A DISTANCE BUTSEEING HIM MERELY AS A COATED FIGURE AT A WIDE ANGLE. THE GENTLEMAN WASTOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE ONE WOMAN TO REFLECT ON THECONTRAST BETWEEN THE TWOA CONTRAST THAT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEENSTRIKING TO A CALM OBSERVER. THEY WERE BOTH TALL AND THEIR EYES WEREON A LEVEL BUT IMAGINE ROSAMONDS INFANTINE BLONDNESS AND WONDROUSCROWN OF HAIRPLAITS WITH HER PALEBLUE DRESS OF A FIT AND FASHION SOPERFECT THAT NO DRESSMAKER COULD LOOK AT IT WITHOUT EMOTION A LARGEEMBROIDERED COLLAR WHICH IT WAS TO BE HOPED ALL BEHOLDERS WOULD KNOWTHE PRICE OF HER SMALL HANDS DULY SET OFF WITH RINGS AND THATCONTROLLED SELFCONSCIOUSNESS OF MANNER WHICH IS THE EXPENSIVESUBSTITUTE FOR SIMPLICITY.THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO INTERRUPT YOU SAID DOROTHEAIMMEDIATELY. I AM ANXIOUS TO SEE MR. LYDGATE IF POSSIBLE BEFORE I GOHOME AND I HOPED THAT YOU MIGHT POSSIBLY TELL ME WHERE I COULD FINDHIM OR EVEN ALLOW ME TO WAIT FOR HIM IF YOU EXPECT HIM SOON.HE IS AT THE NEW HOSPITAL SAID ROSAMOND I AM NOT SURE HOW SOON HEWILL COME HOME. BUT I CAN SEND FOR HIM.WILL YOU LET ME GO AND FETCH HIM SAID WILL LADISLAW COMING FORWARD.HE HAD ALREADY TAKEN UP HIS HAT BEFORE DOROTHEA ENTERED. SHE COLOREDWITH SURPRISE BUT PUT OUT HER HAND WITH A SMILE OF UNMISTAKABLEPLEASURE SAYINGI DID NOT KNOW IT WAS YOU I HAD NO THOUGHT OF SEEING YOU HERE.MAY I GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND TELL MR. LYDGATE THAT YOU WISH TO SEEHIM SAID WILL.IT WOULD BE QUICKER TO SEND THE CARRIAGE FOR HIM SAID DOROTHEA IFYOU WILL BE KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE THE MESSAGE TO THE COACHMAN.WILL WAS MOVING TO THE DOOR WHEN DOROTHEA WHOSE MIND HAD FLASHED IN ANINSTANT OVER MANY CONNECTED MEMORIES TURNED QUICKLY AND SAID I WILLGO MYSELF THANK YOU. I WISH TO LOSE NO TIME BEFORE GETTING HOME AGAIN.I WILL DRIVE TO THE HOSPITAL AND SEE MR. LYDGATE THERE. PRAY EXCUSE MEMRS. LYDGATE. I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU.HER MIND WAS EVIDENTLY ARRESTED BY SOME SUDDEN THOUGHT AND SHE LEFTTHE ROOM HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT WAS IMMEDIATELY AROUND HERHARDLYCONSCIOUS THAT WILL OPENED THE DOOR FOR HER AND OFFERED HER HIS ARM TOLEAD HER TO THE CARRIAGE. SHE TOOK THE ARM BUT SAID NOTHING. WILL WASFEELING RATHER VEXED AND MISERABLE AND FOUND NOTHING TO SAY ON HISSIDE. HE HANDED HER INTO THE CARRIAGE IN SILENCE THEY SAID GOODBYAND DOROTHEA DROVE AWAY.IN THE FIVE MINUTES DRIVE TO THE HOSPITAL SHE HAD TIME FOR SOMEREFLECTIONS THAT WERE QUITE NEW TO HER. HER DECISION TO GO AND HERPREOCCUPATION IN LEAVING THE ROOM HAD COME FROM THE SUDDEN SENSE THATTHERE WOULD BE A SORT OF DECEPTION IN HER VOLUNTARILY ALLOWING ANYFURTHER INTERCOURSE BETWEEN HERSELF AND WILL WHICH SHE WAS UNABLE TOMENTION TO HER HUSBAND AND ALREADY HER ERRAND IN SEEKING LYDGATE WAS AMATTER OF CONCEALMENT. THAT WAS ALL THAT HAD BEEN EXPLICITLY IN HERMIND BUT SHE HAD BEEN URGED ALSO BY A VAGUE DISCOMFORT. NOW THAT SHEWAS ALONE IN HER DRIVE SHE HEARD THE NOTES OF THE MANS VOICE AND THEACCOMPANYING PIANO WHICH SHE HAD NOT NOTED MUCH AT THE TIME RETURNINGON HER INWARD SENSE AND SHE FOUND HERSELF THINKING WITH SOME WONDERTHAT WILL LADISLAW WAS PASSING HIS TIME WITH MRS. LYDGATE IN HERHUSBANDS ABSENCE. AND THEN SHE COULD NOT HELP REMEMBERING THAT HE HADPASSED SOME TIME WITH HER UNDER LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES SO WHY SHOULD THEREBE ANY UNFITNESS IN THE FACT BUT WILL WAS MR. CASAUBONS RELATIVE ANDONE TOWARDS WHOM SHE WAS BOUND TO SHOW KINDNESS. STILL THERE HAD BEENSIGNS WHICH PERHAPS SHE OUGHT TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD AS IMPLYING THAT MR.CASAUBON DID NOT LIKE HIS COUSINS VISITS DURING HIS OWN ABSENCE.PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN IN MANY THINGS SAID POOR DOROTHEA TOHERSELF WHILE THE TEARS CAME ROLLING AND SHE HAD TO DRY THEM QUICKLY.SHE FELT CONFUSEDLY UNHAPPY AND THE IMAGE OF WILL WHICH HAD BEEN SOCLEAR TO HER BEFORE WAS MYSTERIOUSLY SPOILED. BUT THE CARRIAGE STOPPEDAT THE GATE OF THE HOSPITAL. SHE WAS SOON WALKING ROUND THE GRASS PLOTSWITH LYDGATE AND HER FEELINGS RECOVERED THE STRONG BENT WHICH HAD MADEHER SEEK FOR THIS INTERVIEW.WILL LADISLAW MEANWHILE WAS MORTIFIED AND KNEW THE REASON OF ITCLEARLY ENOUGH. HIS CHANCES OF MEETING DOROTHEA WERE RARE AND HERE FORTHE FIRST TIME THERE HAD COME A CHANCE WHICH HAD SET HIM AT ADISADVANTAGE. IT WAS NOT ONLY AS IT HAD BEEN HITHERTO THAT SHE WASNOT SUPREMELY OCCUPIED WITH HIM BUT THAT SHE HAD SEEN HIM UNDERCIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH HE MIGHT APPEAR NOT TO BE SUPREMELY OCCUPIEDWITH HER. HE FELT THRUST TO A NEW DISTANCE FROM HER AMONGST THECIRCLES OF MIDDLEMARCHERS WHO MADE NO PART OF HER LIFE. BUT THAT WASNOT HIS FAULT OF COURSE SINCE HE HAD TAKEN HIS LODGINGS IN THE TOWNHE HAD BEEN MAKING AS MANY ACQUAINTANCES AS HE COULD HIS POSITIONREQUIRING THAT HE SHOULD KNOW EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING. LYDGATE WASREALLY BETTER WORTH KNOWING THAN ANY ONE ELSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ANDHE HAPPENED TO HAVE A WIFE WHO WAS MUSICAL AND ALTOGETHER WORTH CALLINGUPON. HERE WAS THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE SITUATION IN WHICH DIANA HADDESCENDED TOO UNEXPECTEDLY ON HER WORSHIPPER. IT WAS MORTIFYING. WILLWAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AT MIDDLEMARCH BUT FORDOROTHEA AND YET HIS POSITION THERE WAS THREATENING TO DIVIDE HIM FROMHER WITH THOSE BARRIERS OF HABITUAL SENTIMENT WHICH ARE MORE FATAL TOTHE PERSISTENCE OF MUTUAL INTEREST THAN ALL THE DISTANCE BETWEEN ROMEAND BRITAIN. PREJUDICES ABOUT RANK AND STATUS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO DEFYIN THE FORM OF A TYRANNICAL LETTER FROM MR. CASAUBON BUT PREJUDICESLIKE ODOROUS BODIES HAVE A DOUBLE EXISTENCE BOTH SOLID ANDSUBTLESOLID AS THE PYRAMIDS SUBTLE AS THE TWENTIETH ECHO OF AN ECHOOR AS THE MEMORY OF HYACINTHS WHICH ONCE SCENTED THE DARKNESS. AND WILLWAS OF A TEMPERAMENT TO FEEL KEENLY THE PRESENCE OF SUBTLETIES A MANOF CLUMSIER PERCEPTIONS WOULD NOT HAVE FELT AS HE DID THAT FOR THEFIRST TIME SOME SENSE OF UNFITNESS IN PERFECT FREEDOM WITH HIM HADSPRUNG UP IN DOROTHEAS MIND AND THAT THEIR SILENCE AS HE CONDUCTEDHER TO THE CARRIAGE HAD HAD A CHILL IN IT. PERHAPS CASAUBON IN HISHATRED AND JEALOUSY HAD BEEN INSISTING TO DOROTHEA THAT WILL HAD SLIDBELOW HER SOCIALLY. CONFOUND CASAUBONWILL REENTERED THE DRAWINGROOM TOOK UP HIS HAT AND LOOKINGIRRITATED AS HE ADVANCED TOWARDS MRS. LYDGATE WHO HAD SEATED HERSELFAT HER WORKTABLE SAIDIT IS ALWAYS FATAL TO HAVE MUSIC OR POETRY INTERRUPTED. MAY I COMEANOTHER DAY AND JUST FINISH ABOUT THE RENDERING OF LUNGI DAL CAROBENEI SHALL BE HAPPY TO BE TAUGHT SAID ROSAMOND. BUT I AM SURE YOUADMIT THAT THE INTERRUPTION WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL ONE. I QUITE ENVY YOURACQUAINTANCE WITH MRS. CASAUBON. IS SHE VERY CLEVER SHE LOOKS AS IFSHE WERE.REALLY I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT SAID WILL SULKILY.THAT IS JUST THE ANSWER TERTIUS GAVE ME WHEN I FIRST ASKED HIM IF SHEWERE HANDSOME. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU GENTLEMEN ARE THINKING OF WHEN YOUARE WITH MRS. CASAUBONHERSELF SAID WILL NOT INDISPOSED TO PROVOKE THE CHARMING MRS.LYDGATE. WHEN ONE SEES A PERFECT WOMAN ONE NEVER THINKS OF HERATTRIBUTESONE IS CONSCIOUS OF HER PRESENCE.I SHALL BE JEALOUS WHEN TERTIUS GOES TO LOWICK SAID ROSAMONDDIMPLING AND SPEAKING WITH AERY LIGHTNESS. HE WILL COME BACK ANDTHINK NOTHING OF ME.THAT DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN THE EFFECT ON LYDGATE HITHERTO. MRS.CASAUBON IS TOO UNLIKE OTHER WOMEN FOR THEM TO BE COMPARED WITH HER.YOU ARE A DEVOUT WORSHIPPER I PERCEIVE. YOU OFTEN SEE HER ISUPPOSE.NO SAID WILL ALMOST PETTISHLY. WORSHIP IS USUALLY A MATTER OFTHEORY RATHER THAN OF PRACTICE. BUT I AM PRACTISING IT TO EXCESS JUSTAT THIS MOMENTI MUST REALLY TEAR MYSELF AWAY.PRAY COME AGAIN SOME EVENING MR. LYDGATE WILL LIKE TO HEAR THE MUSICAND I CANNOT ENJOY IT SO WELL WITHOUT HIM.WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS AT HOME AGAIN ROSAMOND SAID STANDING IN FRONT OFHIM AND HOLDING HIS COATCOLLAR WITH BOTH HER HANDS MR. LADISLAW WASHERE SINGING WITH ME WHEN MRS. CASAUBON CAME IN. HE SEEMED VEXED. DOYOU THINK HE DISLIKED HER SEEING HIM AT OUR HOUSE SURELY YOUR POSITIONIS MORE THAN EQUAL TO HISWHATEVER MAY BE HIS RELATION TO THECASAUBONS.NO NO IT MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE IF HE WERE REALLY VEXED. LADISLAW ISA SORT OF GYPSY HE THINKS NOTHING OF LEATHER AND PRUNELLA.MUSIC APART HE IS NOT ALWAYS VERY AGREEABLE. DO YOU LIKE HIMYES I THINK HE IS A GOOD FELLOW RATHER MISCELLANEOUS ANDBRICABRAC BUT LIKABLE.DO YOU KNOW I THINK HE ADORES MRS. CASAUBON.POOR DEVIL SAID LYDGATE SMILING AND PINCHING HIS WIFES EARS.ROSAMOND FELT HERSELF BEGINNING TO KNOW A GREAT DEAL OF THE WORLDESPECIALLY IN DISCOVERING WHAT WHEN SHE WAS IN HER UNMARRIED GIRLHOODHAD BEEN INCONCEIVABLE TO HER EXCEPT AS A DIM TRAGEDY IN BYGONECOSTUMESTHAT WOMEN EVEN AFTER MARRIAGE MIGHT MAKE CONQUESTS ANDENSLAVE MEN. AT THAT TIME YOUNG LADIES IN THE COUNTRY EVEN WHENEDUCATED AT MRS. LEMONS READ LITTLE FRENCH LITERATURE LATER THANRACINE AND PUBLIC PRINTS HAD NOT CAST THEIR PRESENT MAGNIFICENTILLUMINATION OVER THE SCANDALS OF LIFE. STILL VANITY WITH A WOMANSWHOLE MIND AND DAY TO WORK IN CAN CONSTRUCT ABUNDANTLY ON SLIGHTHINTS ESPECIALLY ON SUCH A HINT AS THE POSSIBILITY OF INDEFINITECONQUESTS. HOW DELIGHTFUL TO MAKE CAPTIVES FROM THE THRONE OF MARRIAGEWITH A HUSBAND AS CROWNPRINCE BY YOUR SIDEHIMSELF IN FACT ASUBJECTWHILE THE CAPTIVES LOOK UP FOREVER HOPELESS LOSING THEIR RESTPROBABLY AND IF THEIR APPETITE TOO SO MUCH THE BETTER BUT ROSAMONDSROMANCE TURNED AT PRESENT CHIEFLY ON HER CROWNPRINCE AND IT WASENOUGH TO ENJOY HIS ASSURED SUBJECTION. WHEN HE SAID POOR DEVIL SHEASKED WITH PLAYFUL CURIOSITYWHY SOWHY WHAT CAN A MAN DO WHEN HE TAKES TO ADORING ONE OF YOU MERMAIDSHE ONLY NEGLECTS HIS WORK AND RUNS UP BILLS.I AM SURE YOU DO NOT NEGLECT YOUR WORK. YOU ARE ALWAYS AT THEHOSPITAL OR SEEING POOR PATIENTS OR THINKING ABOUT SOME DOCTORSQUARREL AND THEN AT HOME YOU ALWAYS WANT TO PORE OVER YOUR MICROSCOPEAND PHIALS. CONFESS YOU LIKE THOSE THINGS BETTER THAN ME.HAVENT YOU AMBITION ENOUGH TO WISH THAT YOUR HUSBAND SHOULD BESOMETHING BETTER THAN A MIDDLEMARCH DOCTOR SAID LYDGATE LETTING HISHANDS FALL ON TO HIS WIFES SHOULDERS AND LOOKING AT HER WITHAFFECTIONATE GRAVITY. I SHALL MAKE YOU LEARN MY FAVORITE BIT FROM ANOLD POETWHY SHOULD OUR PRIDE MAKE SUCH A STIR TO BEAND BE FORGOT WHAT GOOD IS LIKE TO THISTO DO WORTHY THE WRITING AND TO WRITEWORTHY THE READING AND THE WORLDS DELIGHTWHAT I WANT ROSY IS TO DO WORTHY THE WRITINGAND TO WRITE OUT MYSELFWHAT I HAVE DONE. A MAN MUST WORK TO DO THAT MY PET.OF COURSE I WISH YOU TO MAKE DISCOVERIES NO ONE COULD MORE WISH YOUTO ATTAIN A HIGH POSITION IN SOME BETTER PLACE THAN MIDDLEMARCH. YOUCANNOT SAY THAT I HAVE EVER TRIED TO HINDER YOU FROM WORKING. BUT WECANNOT LIVE LIKE HERMITS. YOU ARE NOT DISCONTENTED WITH ME TERTIUSNO DEAR NO. I AM TOO ENTIRELY CONTENTED.BUT WHAT DID MRS. CASAUBON WANT TO SAY TO YOUMERELY TO ASK ABOUT HER HUSBANDS HEALTH. BUT I THINK SHE IS GOING TOBE SPLENDID TO OUR NEW HOSPITAL I THINK SHE WILL GIVE US TWO HUNDREDAYEAR.CHAPTER XLIV.I WOULD NOT CREEP ALONG THE COAST BUT STEEROUT IN MIDSEA BY GUIDANCE OF THE STARS.WHEN DOROTHEA WALKING ROUND THE LAURELPLANTED PLOTS OF THE NEWHOSPITAL WITH LYDGATE HAD LEARNED FROM HIM THAT THERE WERE NO SIGNS OFCHANGE IN MR. CASAUBONS BODILY CONDITION BEYOND THE MENTAL SIGN OFANXIETY TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS ILLNESS SHE WAS SILENT FOR A FEWMOMENTS WONDERING WHETHER SHE HAD SAID OR DONE ANYTHING TO ROUSE THISNEW ANXIETY. LYDGATE NOT WILLING TO LET SLIP AN OPPORTUNITY OFFURTHERING A FAVORITE PURPOSE VENTURED TO SAYI DONT KNOW WHETHER YOUR OR MR. CASAUBONS ATTENTION HAS BEEN DRAWNTO THE NEEDS OF OUR NEW HOSPITAL. CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE MADE IT SEEMRATHER EGOTISTIC IN ME TO URGE THE SUBJECT BUT THAT IS NOT MY FAULTIT IS BECAUSE THERE IS A FIGHT BEING MADE AGAINST IT BY THE OTHERMEDICAL MEN. I THINK YOU ARE GENERALLY INTERESTED IN SUCH THINGS FOR IREMEMBER THAT WHEN I FIRST HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU AT TIPTONGRANGE BEFORE YOUR MARRIAGE YOU WERE ASKING ME SOME QUESTIONS ABOUTTHE WAY IN WHICH THE HEALTH OF THE POOR WAS AFFECTED BY THEIR MISERABLEHOUSING.YES INDEED SAID DOROTHEA BRIGHTENING. I SHALL BE QUITE GRATEFULTO YOU IF YOU WILL TELL ME HOW I CAN HELP TO MAKE THINGS A LITTLEBETTER. EVERYTHING OF THAT SORT HAS SLIPPED AWAY FROM ME SINCE I HAVEBEEN MARRIED. I MEAN SHE SAID AFTER A MOMENTS HESITATION THAT THEPEOPLE IN OUR VILLAGE ARE TOLERABLY COMFORTABLE AND MY MIND HAS BEENTOO MUCH TAKEN UP FOR ME TO INQUIRE FURTHER. BUT HEREIN SUCH A PLACEAS MIDDLEMARCHTHERE MUST BE A GREAT DEAL TO BE DONE.THERE IS EVERYTHING TO BE DONE SAID LYDGATE WITH ABRUPT ENERGY.AND THIS HOSPITAL IS A CAPITAL PIECE OF WORK DUE ENTIRELY TO MR.BULSTRODES EXERTIONS AND IN A GREAT DEGREE TO HIS MONEY. BUT ONE MANCANT DO EVERYTHING IN A SCHEME OF THIS SORT. OF COURSE HE LOOKEDFORWARD TO HELP. AND NOW THERES A MEAN PETTY FEUD SET UP AGAINST THETHING IN THE TOWN BY CERTAIN PERSONS WHO WANT TO MAKE IT A FAILURE.WHAT CAN BE THEIR REASONS SAID DOROTHEA WITH NAIVE SURPRISE.CHIEFLY MR. BULSTRODES UNPOPULARITY TO BEGIN WITH. HALF THE TOWNWOULD ALMOST TAKE TROUBLE FOR THE SAKE OF THWARTING HIM. IN THIS STUPIDWORLD MOST PEOPLE NEVER CONSIDER THAT A THING IS GOOD TO BE DONE UNLESSIT IS DONE BY THEIR OWN SET. I HAD NO CONNECTION WITH BULSTRODE BEFOREI CAME HERE. I LOOK AT HIM QUITE IMPARTIALLY AND I SEE THAT HE HASSOME NOTIONSTHAT HE HAS SET THINGS ON FOOTWHICH I CAN TURN TO GOODPUBLIC PURPOSE. IF A FAIR NUMBER OF THE BETTER EDUCATED MEN WENT TOWORK WITH THE BELIEF THAT THEIR OBSERVATIONS MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THEREFORM OF MEDICAL DOCTRINE AND PRACTICE WE SHOULD SOON SEE A CHANGEFOR THE BETTER. THATS MY POINT OF VIEW. I HOLD THAT BY REFUSING TOWORK WITH MR. BULSTRODE I SHOULD BE TURNING MY BACK ON AN OPPORTUNITYOF MAKING MY PROFESSION MORE GENERALLY SERVICEABLE.I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU SAID DOROTHEA AT ONCE FASCINATED BY THESITUATION SKETCHED IN LYDGATES WORDS. BUT WHAT IS THERE AGAINST MR.BULSTRODE I KNOW THAT MY UNCLE IS FRIENDLY WITH HIM.PEOPLE DONT LIKE HIS RELIGIOUS TONE SAID LYDGATE BREAKING OFFTHERE.THAT IS ALL THE STRONGER REASON FOR DESPISING SUCH AN OPPOSITIONSAID DOROTHEA LOOKING AT THE AFFAIRS OF MIDDLEMARCH BY THE LIGHT OFTHE GREAT PERSECUTIONS.TO PUT THE MATTER QUITE FAIRLY THEY HAVE OTHER OBJECTIONS TO HIMHEIS MASTERFUL AND RATHER UNSOCIABLE AND HE IS CONCERNED WITH TRADEWHICH HAS COMPLAINTS OF ITS OWN THAT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. BUT WHAT HASTHAT TO DO WITH THE QUESTION WHETHER IT WOULD NOT BE A FINE THING TOESTABLISH HERE A MORE VALUABLE HOSPITAL THAN ANY THEY HAVE IN THECOUNTY THE IMMEDIATE MOTIVE TO THE OPPOSITION HOWEVER IS THE FACTTHAT BULSTRODE HAS PUT THE MEDICAL DIRECTION INTO MY HANDS. OF COURSE IAM GLAD OF THAT. IT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SOME GOODWORKAND I AM AWARE THAT I HAVE TO JUSTIFY HIS CHOICE OF ME. BUT THECONSEQUENCE IS THAT THE WHOLE PROFESSION IN MIDDLEMARCH HAVE SETTHEMSELVES TOOTH AND NAIL AGAINST THE HOSPITAL AND NOT ONLY REFUSE TOCOOPERATE THEMSELVES BUT TRY TO BLACKEN THE WHOLE AFFAIR AND HINDERSUBSCRIPTIONS.HOW VERY PETTY EXCLAIMED DOROTHEA INDIGNANTLY.I SUPPOSE ONE MUST EXPECT TO FIGHT ONES WAY THERE IS HARDLY ANYTHINGTO BE DONE WITHOUT IT. AND THE IGNORANCE OF PEOPLE ABOUT HERE ISSTUPENDOUS. I DONT LAY CLAIM TO ANYTHING ELSE THAN HAVING USED SOMEOPPORTUNITIES WHICH HAVE NOT COME WITHIN EVERYBODYS REACH BUT THEREIS NO STIFLING THE OFFENCE OF BEING YOUNG AND A NEWCOMER ANDHAPPENING TO KNOW SOMETHING MORE THAN THE OLD INHABITANTS. STILL IF IBELIEVE THAT I CAN SET GOING A BETTER METHOD OF TREATMENTIF I BELIEVETHAT I CAN PURSUE CERTAIN OBSERVATIONS AND INQUIRIES WHICH MAY BE ALASTING BENEFIT TO MEDICAL PRACTICE I SHOULD BE A BASE TRUCKLER IF IALLOWED ANY CONSIDERATION OF PERSONAL COMFORT TO HINDER ME. AND THECOURSE IS ALL THE CLEARER FROM THERE BEING NO SALARY IN QUESTION TO PUTMY PERSISTENCE IN AN EQUIVOCAL LIGHT.I AM GLAD YOU HAVE TOLD ME THIS MR. LYDGATE SAID DOROTHEACORDIALLY. I FEEL SURE I CAN HELP A LITTLE. I HAVE SOME MONEY ANDDONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ITTHAT IS OFTEN AN UNCOMFORTABLE THOUGHT TOME. I AM SURE I CAN SPARE TWO HUNDRED AYEAR FOR A GRAND PURPOSE LIKETHIS. HOW HAPPY YOU MUST BE TO KNOW THINGS THAT YOU FEEL SURE WILL DOGREAT GOOD I WISH I COULD AWAKE WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE EVERY MORNING.THERE SEEMS TO BE SO MUCH TROUBLE TAKEN THAT ONE CAN HARDLY SEE THEGOOD OFTHERE WAS A MELANCHOLY CADENCE IN DOROTHEAS VOICE AS SHE SPOKE THESELAST WORDS. BUT SHE PRESENTLY ADDED MORE CHEERFULLY PRAY COME TOLOWICK AND TELL US MORE OF THIS. I WILL MENTION THE SUBJECT TO MR.CASAUBON. I MUST HASTEN HOME NOW.SHE DID MENTION IT THAT EVENING AND SAID THAT SHE SHOULD LIKE TOSUBSCRIBE TWO HUNDRED AYEARSHE HAD SEVEN HUNDRED AYEAR AS THEEQUIVALENT OF HER OWN FORTUNE SETTLED ON HER AT HER MARRIAGE. MR.CASAUBON MADE NO OBJECTION BEYOND A PASSING REMARK THAT THE SUM MIGHTBE DISPROPORTIONATE IN RELATION TO OTHER GOOD OBJECTS BUT WHENDOROTHEA IN HER IGNORANCE RESISTED THAT SUGGESTION HE ACQUIESCED. HEDID NOT CARE HIMSELF ABOUT SPENDING MONEY AND WAS NOT RELUCTANT TOGIVE IT. IF HE EVER FELT KEENLY ANY QUESTION OF MONEY IT WAS THROUGHTHE MEDIUM OF ANOTHER PASSION THAN THE LOVE OF MATERIAL PROPERTY.DOROTHEA TOLD HIM THAT SHE HAD SEEN LYDGATE AND RECITED THE GIST OFHER CONVERSATION WITH HIM ABOUT THE HOSPITAL. MR. CASAUBON DID NOTQUESTION HER FURTHER BUT HE FELT SURE THAT SHE HAD WISHED TO KNOW WHATHAD PASSED BETWEEN LYDGATE AND HIMSELF. SHE KNOWS THAT I KNOW SAIDTHE EVERRESTLESS VOICE WITHIN BUT THAT INCREASE OF TACIT KNOWLEDGEONLY THRUST FURTHER OFF ANY CONFIDENCE BETWEEN THEM. HE DISTRUSTED HERAFFECTION AND WHAT LONELINESS IS MORE LONELY THAN DISTRUSTCHAPTER XLV.IT IS THE HUMOR OF MANY HEADS TO EXTOL THE DAYS OF THEIR FOREFATHERSAND DECLAIM AGAINST THE WICKEDNESS OF TIMES PRESENT. WHICHNOTWITHSTANDING THEY CANNOT HANDSOMELY DO WITHOUT THE BORROWED HELPAND SATIRE OF TIMES PAST CONDEMNING THE VICES OF THEIR OWN TIMES BYTHE EXPRESSIONS OF VICES IN TIMES WHICH THEY COMMEND WHICH CANNOT BUTARGUE THE COMMUNITY OF VICE IN BOTH. HORACE THEREFORE JUVENAL ANDPERSIUS WERE NO PROPHETS ALTHOUGH THEIR LINES DID SEEM TO INDIGITATEAND POINT AT OUR TIMES.SIR THOMAS BROWNE PSEUDODOXIA EPIDEMICA.THAT OPPOSITION TO THE NEW FEVER HOSPITAL WHICH LYDGATE HAD SKETCHED TODOROTHEA WAS LIKE OTHER OPPOSITIONS TO BE VIEWED IN MANY DIFFERENTLIGHTS. HE REGARDED IT AS A MIXTURE OF JEALOUSY AND DUNDERHEADEDPREJUDICE. MR. BULSTRODE SAW IN IT NOT ONLY MEDICAL JEALOUSY BUT ADETERMINATION TO THWART HIMSELF PROMPTED MAINLY BY A HATRED OF THATVITAL RELIGION OF WHICH HE HAD STRIVEN TO BE AN EFFECTUAL LAYREPRESENTATIVEA HATRED WHICH CERTAINLY FOUND PRETEXTS APART FROMRELIGION SUCH AS WERE ONLY TOO EASY TO FIND IN THE ENTANGLEMENTS OFHUMAN ACTION. THESE MIGHT BE CALLED THE MINISTERIAL VIEWS. BUTOPPOSITIONS HAVE THE ILLIMITABLE RANGE OF OBJECTIONS AT COMMAND WHICHNEED NEVER STOP SHORT AT THE BOUNDARY OF KNOWLEDGE BUT CAN DRAWFOREVER ON THE VASTS OF IGNORANCE. WHAT THE OPPOSITION IN MIDDLEMARCHSAID ABOUT THE NEW HOSPITAL AND ITS ADMINISTRATION HAD CERTAINLY AGREAT DEAL OF ECHO IN IT FOR HEAVEN HAS TAKEN CARE THAT EVERYBODYSHALL NOT BE AN ORIGINATOR BUT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES WHICHREPRESENTED EVERY SOCIAL SHADE BETWEEN THE POLISHED MODERATION OF DR.MINCHIN AND THE TRENCHANT ASSERTION OF MRS. DOLLOP THE LANDLADY OF THETANKARD IN SLAUGHTER LANE.MRS. DOLLOP BECAME MORE AND MORE CONVINCED BY HER OWN ASSEVERATIONTHAT DR. LYDGATE MEANT TO LET THE PEOPLE DIE IN THE HOSPITAL IF NOT TOPOISON THEM FOR THE SAKE OF CUTTING THEM UP WITHOUT SAYING BY YOURLEAVE OR WITH YOUR LEAVE FOR IT WAS A KNOWN FAC THAT HE HAD WANTEDTO CUT UP MRS. GOBY AS RESPECTABLE A WOMAN AS ANY IN PARLEY STREETWHO HAD MONEY IN TRUST BEFORE HER MARRIAGEA POOR TALE FOR A DOCTORWHO IF HE WAS GOOD FOR ANYTHING SHOULD KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITHYOU BEFORE YOU DIED AND NOT WANT TO PRY INTO YOUR INSIDE AFTER YOUWERE GONE. IF THAT WAS NOT REASON MRS. DOLLOP WISHED TO KNOW WHAT WASBUT THERE WAS A PREVALENT FEELING IN HER AUDIENCE THAT HER OPINION WASA BULWARK AND THAT IF IT WERE OVERTHROWN THERE WOULD BE NO LIMITS TOTHE CUTTINGUP OF BODIES AS HAD BEEN WELL SEEN IN BURKE AND HARE WITHTHEIR PITCHPLAISTERSSUCH A HANGING BUSINESS AS THAT WAS NOT WANTED INMIDDLEMARCHAND LET IT NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT OPINION AT THE TANKARD IN SLAUGHTERLANE WAS UNIMPORTANT TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSION THAT OLD AUTHENTICPUBLICHOUSETHE ORIGINAL TANKARD KNOWN BY THE NAME OF DOLLOPSWASTHE RESORT OF A GREAT BENEFIT CLUB WHICH HAD SOME MONTHS BEFORE PUT TOTHE VOTE WHETHER ITS LONGSTANDING MEDICAL MAN DOCTOR GAMBIT SHOULDNOT BE CASHIERED IN FAVOR OF THIS DOCTOR LYDGATE WHO WAS CAPABLE OFPERFORMING THE MOST ASTONISHING CURES AND RESCUING PEOPLE ALTOGETHERGIVEN UP BY OTHER PRACTITIONERS. BUT THE BALANCE HAD BEEN TURNEDAGAINST LYDGATE BY TWO MEMBERS WHO FOR SOME PRIVATE REASONS HELD THATTHIS POWER OF RESUSCITATING PERSONS AS GOOD AS DEAD WAS AN EQUIVOCALRECOMMENDATION AND MIGHT INTERFERE WITH PROVIDENTIAL FAVORS. IN THECOURSE OF THE YEAR HOWEVER THERE HAD BEEN A CHANGE IN THE PUBLICSENTIMENT OF WHICH THE UNANIMITY AT DOLLOPS WAS AN INDEX.A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN A YEAR AGO BEFORE ANYTHING WAS KNOWN OFLYDGATES SKILL THE JUDGMENTS ON IT HAD NATURALLY BEEN DIVIDEDDEPENDING ON A SENSE OF LIKELIHOOD SITUATED PERHAPS IN THE PIT OF THESTOMACH OR IN THE PINEAL GLAND AND DIFFERING IN ITS VERDICTS BUT NOTTHE LESS VALUABLE AS A GUIDE IN THE TOTAL DEFICIT OF EVIDENCE. PATIENTSWHO HAD CHRONIC DISEASES OR WHOSE LIVES HAD LONG BEEN WORN THREADBARELIKE OLD FEATHERSTONES HAD BEEN AT ONCE INCLINED TO TRY HIM ALSOMANY WHO DID NOT LIKE PAYING THEIR DOCTORS BILLS THOUGHT AGREEABLY OFOPENING AN ACCOUNT WITH A NEW DOCTOR AND SENDING FOR HIM WITHOUT STINTIF THE CHILDRENS TEMPER WANTED A DOSE OCCASIONS WHEN THE OLDPRACTITIONERS WERE OFTEN CRUSTY AND ALL PERSONS THUS INCLINED TOEMPLOY LYDGATE HELD IT LIKELY THAT HE WAS CLEVER. SOME CONSIDERED THATHE MIGHT DO MORE THAN OTHERS WHERE THERE WAS LIVERAT LEAST THEREWOULD BE NO HARM IN GETTING A FEW BOTTLES OF STUFF FROM HIM SINCE IFTHESE PROVED USELESS IT WOULD STILL BE POSSIBLE TO RETURN TO THEPURIFYING PILLS WHICH KEPT YOU ALIVE IF THEY DID NOT REMOVE THEYELLOWNESS. BUT THESE WERE PEOPLE OF MINOR IMPORTANCE. GOOD MIDDLEMARCHFAMILIES WERE OF COURSE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THEIR DOCTOR WITHOUT REASONSHOWN AND EVERYBODY WHO HAD EMPLOYED MR. PEACOCK DID NOT FEEL OBLIGEDTO ACCEPT A NEW MAN MERELY IN THE CHARACTER OF HIS SUCCESSOR OBJECTINGTHAT HE WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE EQUAL TO PEACOCK.BUT LYDGATE HAD NOT BEEN LONG IN THE TOWN BEFORE THERE WERE PARTICULARSENOUGH REPORTED OF HIM TO BREED MUCH MORE SPECIFIC EXPECTATIONS AND TOINTENSIFY DIFFERENCES INTO PARTISANSHIP SOME OF THE PARTICULARS BEINGOF THAT IMPRESSIVE ORDER OF WHICH THE SIGNIFICANCE IS ENTIRELY HIDDENLIKE A STATISTICAL AMOUNT WITHOUT A STANDARD OF COMPARISON BUT WITH ANOTE OF EXCLAMATION AT THE END. THE CUBIC FEET OF OXYGEN YEARLYSWALLOWED BY A FULLGROWN MANWHAT A SHUDDER THEY MIGHT HAVE CREATED INSOME MIDDLEMARCH CIRCLES OXYGEN NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT MAY BEIS ITANY WONDER THE CHOLERA HAS GOT TO DANTZIC AND YET THERE ARE PEOPLE WHOSAY QUARANTINE IS NO GOODONE OF THE FACTS QUICKLY RUMORED WAS THAT LYDGATE DID NOT DISPENSEDRUGS. THIS WAS OFFENSIVE BOTH TO THE PHYSICIANS WHOSE EXCLUSIVEDISTINCTION SEEMED INFRINGED ON AND TO THE SURGEONAPOTHECARIES WITHWHOM HE RANGED HIMSELF AND ONLY A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE THEY MIGHT HAVECOUNTED ON HAVING THE LAW ON THEIR SIDE AGAINST A MAN WHO WITHOUTCALLING HIMSELF A LONDONMADE M.D. DARED TO ASK FOR PAY EXCEPT AS ACHARGE ON DRUGS. BUT LYDGATE HAD NOT BEEN EXPERIENCED ENOUGH TO FORESEETHAT HIS NEW COURSE WOULD BE EVEN MORE OFFENSIVE TO THE LAITY AND TOMR. MAWMSEY AN IMPORTANT GROCER IN THE TOP MARKET WHO THOUGH NOT ONEOF HIS PATIENTS QUESTIONED HIM IN AN AFFABLE MANNER ON THE SUBJECT HEWAS INJUDICIOUS ENOUGH TO GIVE A HASTY POPULAR EXPLANATION OF HISREASONS POINTING OUT TO MR. MAWMSEY THAT IT MUST LOWER THE CHARACTEROF PRACTITIONERS AND BE A CONSTANT INJURY TO THE PUBLIC IF THEIR ONLYMODE OF GETTING PAID FOR THEIR WORK WAS BY THEIR MAKING OUT LONG BILLSFOR DRAUGHTS BOLUSES AND MIXTURES.IT IS IN THAT WAY THAT HARDWORKING MEDICAL MEN MAY COME TO BE ALMOSTAS MISCHIEVOUS AS QUACKS SAID LYDGATE RATHER THOUGHTLESSLY. TO GETTHEIR OWN BREAD THEY MUST OVERDOSE THE KINGS LIEGES AND THATS A BADSORT OF TREASON MR. MAWMSEYUNDERMINES THE CONSTITUTION IN A FATALWAY.MR. MAWMSEY WAS NOT ONLY AN OVERSEER IT WAS ABOUT A QUESTION OFOUTDOOR PAY THAT HE WAS HAVING AN INTERVIEW WITH LYDGATE HE WAS ALSOASTHMATIC AND HAD AN INCREASING FAMILY THUS FROM A MEDICAL POINT OFVIEW AS WELL AS FROM HIS OWN HE WAS AN IMPORTANT MAN INDEED ANEXCEPTIONAL GROCER WHOSE HAIR WAS ARRANGED IN A FLAMELIKE PYRAMIDAND WHOSE RETAIL DEFERENCE WAS OF THE CORDIAL ENCOURAGINGKINDJOCOSELY COMPLIMENTARY AND WITH A CERTAIN CONSIDERATE ABSTINENCEFROM LETTING OUT THE FULL FORCE OF HIS MIND. IT WAS MR. MAWMSEYSFRIENDLY JOCOSENESS IN QUESTIONING HIM WHICH HAD SET THE TONE OFLYDGATES REPLY. BUT LET THE WISE BE WARNED AGAINST TOO GREAT READINESSAT EXPLANATION IT MULTIPLIES THE SOURCES OF MISTAKE LENGTHENING THESUM FOR RECKONERS SURE TO GO WRONG.LYDGATE SMILED AS HE ENDED HIS SPEECH PUTTING HIS FOOT INTO THESTIRRUP AND MR. MAWMSEY LAUGHED MORE THAN HE WOULD HAVE DONE IF HE HADKNOWN WHO THE KINGS LIEGES WERE GIVING HIS GOOD MORNING SIRGOODMORNING SIR WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO SAW EVERYTHING CLEARLYENOUGH. BUT IN TRUTH HIS VIEWS WERE PERTURBED. FOR YEARS HE HAD BEENPAYING BILLS WITH STRICTLY MADE ITEMS SO THAT FOR EVERY HALFCROWN ANDEIGHTEENPENCE HE WAS CERTAIN SOMETHING MEASURABLE HAD BEEN DELIVERED.HE HAD DONE THIS WITH SATISFACTION INCLUDING IT AMONG HISRESPONSIBILITIES AS A HUSBAND AND FATHER AND REGARDING A LONGER BILLTHAN USUAL AS A DIGNITY WORTH MENTIONING. MOREOVER IN ADDITION TO THEMASSIVE BENEFIT OF THE DRUGS TO SELF AND FAMILY HE HAD ENJOYED THEPLEASURE OF FORMING AN ACUTE JUDGMENT AS TO THEIR IMMEDIATE EFFECTS SOAS TO GIVE AN INTELLIGENT STATEMENT FOR THE GUIDANCE OF MR. GAMBITAPRACTITIONER JUST A LITTLE LOWER IN STATUS THAN WRENCH OR TOLLER ANDESPECIALLY ESTEEMED AS AN ACCOUCHEUR OF WHOSE ABILITY MR. MAWMSEY HADTHE POOREST OPINION ON ALL OTHER POINTS BUT IN DOCTORING HE WAS WONTTO SAY IN AN UNDERTONE HE PLACED GAMBIT ABOVE ANY OF THEM.HERE WERE DEEPER REASONS THAN THE SUPERFICIAL TALK OF A NEW MAN WHICHAPPEARED STILL FLIMSIER IN THE DRAWINGROOM OVER THE SHOP WHEN THEYWERE RECITED TO MRS. MAWMSEY A WOMAN ACCUSTOMED TO BE MADE MUCH OF ASA FERTILE MOTHERGENERALLY UNDER ATTENDANCE MORE OR LESS FREQUENT FROMMR. GAMBIT AND OCCASIONALLY HAVING ATTACKS WHICH REQUIRED DR. MINCHIN.DOES THIS MR. LYDGATE MEAN TO SAY THERE IS NO USE IN TAKING MEDICINESAID MRS. MAWMSEY WHO WAS SLIGHTLY GIVEN TO DRAWLING. I SHOULD LIKEHIM TO TELL ME HOW I COULD BEAR UP AT FAIR TIME IF I DIDNT TAKESTRENGTHENING MEDICINE FOR A MONTH BEFOREHAND. THINK OF WHAT I HAVE TOPROVIDE FOR CALLING CUSTOMERS MY DEARHERE MRS. MAWMSEY TURNED TO ANINTIMATE FEMALE FRIEND WHO SAT BYA LARGE VEAL PIEA STUFFED FILLETAROUND OF BEEFHAM TONGUE ET CETERA ET CETERA BUT WHAT KEEPS ME UPBEST IS THE PINK MIXTURE NOT THE BROWN. I WONDER MR. MAWMSEY WITHYOUR EXPERIENCE YOU COULD HAVE PATIENCE TO LISTEN. I SHOULD HAVETOLD HIM AT ONCE THAT I KNEW A LITTLE BETTER THAN THAT.NO NO NO SAID MR. MAWMSEY I WAS NOT GOING TO TELL HIM MYOPINION. HEAR EVERYTHING AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF IS MY MOTTO. BUT HEDIDNT KNOW WHO HE WAS TALKING TO. I WAS NOT TO BE TURNED ON HISFINGER. PEOPLE OFTEN PRETEND TO TELL ME THINGS WHEN THEY MIGHT AS WELLSAY MAWMSEY YOURE A FOOL. BUT I SMILE AT IT I HUMOR EVERYBODYSWEAK PLACE. IF PHYSIC HAD DONE HARM TO SELF AND FAMILY I SHOULD HAVEFOUND IT OUT BY THIS TIME.THE NEXT DAY MR. GAMBIT WAS TOLD THAT LYDGATE WENT ABOUT SAYING PHYSICWAS OF NO USE.INDEED SAID HE LIFTING HIS EYEBROWS WITH CAUTIOUS SURPRISE. HE WASA STOUT HUSKY MAN WITH A LARGE RING ON HIS FOURTH FINGER. HOW WILL HECURE HIS PATIENTS THENTHAT IS WHAT I SAY RETURNED MRS. MAWMSEY WHO HABITUALLY GAVE WEIGHTTO HER SPEECH BY LOADING HER PRONOUNS. DOES HE SUPPOSE THAT PEOPLEWILL PAY HIM ONLY TO COME AND SIT WITH THEM AND GO AWAY AGAINMRS. MAWMSEY HAD HAD A GREAT DEAL OF SITTING FROM MR. GAMBIT INCLUDINGVERY FULL ACCOUNTS OF HIS OWN HABITS OF BODY AND OTHER AFFAIRS BUT OFCOURSE HE KNEW THERE WAS NO INNUENDO IN HER REMARK SINCE HIS SPARETIME AND PERSONAL NARRATIVE HAD NEVER BEEN CHARGED FOR. SO HE REPLIEDHUMOROUSLYWELL LYDGATE IS A GOODLOOKING YOUNG FELLOW YOU KNOW.NOT ONE THAT I WOULD EMPLOY SAID MRS. MAWMSEY. OTHERS MAY DO ASTHEY PLEASE.HENCE MR. GAMBIT COULD GO AWAY FROM THE CHIEF GROCERS WITHOUT FEAR OFRIVALRY BUT NOT WITHOUT A SENSE THAT LYDGATE WAS ONE OF THOSEHYPOCRITES WHO TRY TO DISCREDIT OTHERS BY ADVERTISING THEIR OWNHONESTY AND THAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH SOME PEOPLES WHILE TO SHOW HIM UP.MR. GAMBIT HOWEVER HAD A SATISFACTORY PRACTICE MUCH PERVADED BY THESMELLS OF RETAIL TRADING WHICH SUGGESTED THE REDUCTION OF CASH PAYMENTSTO A BALANCE. AND HE DID NOT THINK IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO SHOW LYDGATEUP UNTIL HE KNEW HOW. HE HAD NOT INDEED GREAT RESOURCES OF EDUCATIONAND HAD HAD TO WORK HIS OWN WAY AGAINST A GOOD DEAL OF PROFESSIONALCONTEMPT BUT HE MADE NONE THE WORSE ACCOUCHEUR FOR CALLING THEBREATHING APPARATUS LONGS.OTHER MEDICAL MEN FELT THEMSELVES MORE CAPABLE. MR. TOLLER SHARED THEHIGHEST PRACTICE IN THE TOWN AND BELONGED TO AN OLD MIDDLEMARCH FAMILYTHERE WERE TOLLERS IN THE LAW AND EVERYTHING ELSE ABOVE THE LINE OFRETAIL TRADE. UNLIKE OUR IRASCIBLE FRIEND WRENCH HE HAD THE EASIESTWAY IN THE WORLD OF TAKING THINGS WHICH MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO ANNOY HIMBEING A WELLBRED QUIETLY FACETIOUS MAN WHO KEPT A GOOD HOUSE WASVERY FOND OF A LITTLE SPORTING WHEN HE COULD GET IT VERY FRIENDLY WITHMR. HAWLEY AND HOSTILE TO MR. BULSTRODE. IT MAY SEEM ODD THAT WITHSUCH PLEASANT HABITS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE HEROIC TREATMENTBLEEDING AND BLISTERING AND STARVING HIS PATIENTS WITH A DISPASSIONATEDISREGARD TO HIS PERSONAL EXAMPLE BUT THE INCONGRUITY FAVORED THEOPINION OF HIS ABILITY AMONG HIS PATIENTS WHO COMMONLY OBSERVED THATMR. TOLLER HAD LAZY MANNERS BUT HIS TREATMENT WAS AS ACTIVE AS YOUCOULD DESIRE NO MAN SAID THEY CARRIED MORE SERIOUSNESS INTO HISPROFESSION HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW IN COMING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE DIDSOMETHING. HE WAS A GREAT FAVORITE IN HIS OWN CIRCLE AND WHATEVER HEIMPLIED TO ANY ONES DISADVANTAGE TOLD DOUBLY FROM HIS CARELESSIRONICAL TONE.HE NATURALLY GOT TIRED OF SMILING AND SAYING AH WHEN HE WAS TOLDTHAT MR. PEACOCKS SUCCESSOR DID NOT MEAN TO DISPENSE MEDICINES ANDMR. HACKBUTT ONE DAY MENTIONING IT OVER THE WINE AT A DINNERPARTY MR.TOLLER SAID LAUGHINGLY DIBBITTS WILL GET RID OF HIS STALE DRUGSTHEN. IM FOND OF LITTLE DIBBITTSIM GLAD HES IN LUCK.I SEE YOUR MEANING TOLLER SAID MR. HACKBUTT AND I AM ENTIRELY OFYOUR OPINION. I SHALL TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXPRESSING MYSELF TO THATEFFECT. A MEDICAL MAN SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE QUALITY OF THEDRUGS CONSUMED BY HIS PATIENTS. THAT IS THE RATIONALE OF THE SYSTEM OFCHARGING WHICH HAS HITHERTO OBTAINED AND NOTHING IS MORE OFFENSIVETHAN THIS OSTENTATION OF REFORM WHERE THERE IS NO REAL AMELIORATION.OSTENTATION HACKBUTT SAID MR. TOLLER IRONICALLY. I DONT SEETHAT. A MAN CANT VERY WELL BE OSTENTATIOUS OF WHAT NOBODY BELIEVES IN.THERES NO REFORM IN THE MATTER THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE PROFIT ONTHE DRUGS IS PAID TO THE MEDICAL MAN BY THE DRUGGIST OR BY THE PATIENTAND WHETHER THERE SHALL BE EXTRA PAY UNDER THE NAME OF ATTENDANCE.AH TO BE SURE ONE OF YOUR DAMNED NEW VERSIONS OF OLD HUMBUG SAIDMR. HAWLEY PASSING THE DECANTER TO MR. WRENCH.MR. WRENCH GENERALLY ABSTEMIOUS OFTEN DRANK WINE RATHER FREELY AT APARTY GETTING THE MORE IRRITABLE IN CONSEQUENCE.AS TO HUMBUG HAWLEY HE SAID THATS A WORD EASY TO FLING ABOUT.BUT WHAT I CONTEND AGAINST IS THE WAY MEDICAL MEN ARE FOULING THEIR OWNNEST AND SETTING UP A CRY ABOUT THE COUNTRY AS IF A GENERALPRACTITIONER WHO DISPENSES DRUGS COULDNT BE A GENTLEMAN. I THROW BACKTHE IMPUTATION WITH SCORN. I SAY THE MOST UNGENTLEMANLY TRICK A MANCAN BE GUILTY OF IS TO COME AMONG THE MEMBERS OF HIS PROFESSION WITHINNOVATIONS WHICH ARE A LIBEL ON THEIR TIMEHONORED PROCEDURE. THAT ISMY OPINION AND I AM READY TO MAINTAIN IT AGAINST ANY ONE WHOCONTRADICTS ME. MR. WRENCHS VOICE HAD BECOME EXCEEDINGLY SHARP.I CANT OBLIGE YOU THERE WRENCH SAID MR. HAWLEY THRUSTING HISHANDS INTO HIS TROUSERPOCKETS.MY DEAR FELLOW SAID MR. TOLLER STRIKING IN PACIFICALLY AND LOOKINGAT MR. WRENCH THE PHYSICIANS HAVE THEIR TOES TRODDEN ON MORE THAN WEHAVE. IF YOU COME TO DIGNITY IT IS A QUESTION FOR MINCHIN AND SPRAGUE.DOES MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE PROVIDE NOTHING AGAINST THESEINFRINGEMENTS SAID MR. HACKBUTT WITH A DISINTERESTED DESIRE TO OFFERHIS LIGHTS. HOW DOES THE LAW STAND EH HAWLEYNOTHING TO BE DONE THERE SAID MR. HAWLEY. I LOOKED INTO IT FORSPRAGUE. YOUD ONLY BREAK YOUR NOSE AGAINST A DAMNED JUDGES DECISION.POOH NO NEED OF LAW SAID MR. TOLLER. SO FAR AS PRACTICE ISCONCERNED THE ATTEMPT IS AN ABSURDITY. NO PATIENT WILL LIKEITCERTAINLY NOT PEACOCKS WHO HAVE BEEN USED TO DEPLETION. PASS THEWINE.MR. TOLLERS PREDICTION WAS PARTLY VERIFIED. IF MR. AND MRS. MAWMSEYWHO HAD NO IDEA OF EMPLOYING LYDGATE WERE MADE UNEASY BY HIS SUPPOSEDDECLARATION AGAINST DRUGS IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT THOSE WHO CALLED HIMIN SHOULD WATCH A LITTLE ANXIOUSLY TO SEE WHETHER HE DID USE ALL THEMEANS HE MIGHT USE IN THE CASE. EVEN GOOD MR. POWDERELL WHO IN HISCONSTANT CHARITY OF INTERPRETATION WAS INCLINED TO ESTEEM LYDGATE THEMORE FOR WHAT SEEMED A CONSCIENTIOUS PURSUIT OF A BETTER PLAN HAD HISMIND DISTURBED WITH DOUBTS DURING HIS WIFES ATTACK OF ERYSIPELAS ANDCOULD NOT ABSTAIN FROM MENTIONING TO LYDGATE THAT MR. PEACOCK ON ASIMILAR OCCASION HAD ADMINISTERED A SERIES OF BOLUSES WHICH WERE NOTOTHERWISE DEFINABLE THAN BY THEIR REMARKABLE EFFECT IN BRINGING MRS.POWDERELL ROUND BEFORE MICHAELMAS FROM AN ILLNESS WHICH HAD BEGUN IN AREMARKABLY HOT AUGUST. AT LAST INDEED IN THE CONFLICT BETWEEN HISDESIRE NOT TO HURT LYDGATE AND HIS ANXIETY THAT NO MEANS SHOULD BELACKING HE INDUCED HIS WIFE PRIVATELY TO TAKE WIDGEONS PURIFYINGPILLS AN ESTEEMED MIDDLEMARCH MEDICINE WHICH ARRESTED EVERY DISEASEAT THE FOUNTAIN BY SETTING TO WORK AT ONCE UPON THE BLOOD. THISCOOPERATIVE MEASURE WAS NOT TO BE MENTIONED TO LYDGATE AND MR.POWDERELL HIMSELF HAD NO CERTAIN RELIANCE ON IT ONLY HOPING THAT ITMIGHT BE ATTENDED WITH A BLESSING.BUT IN THIS DOUBTFUL STAGE OF LYDGATES INTRODUCTION HE WAS HELPED BYWHAT WE MORTALS RASHLY CALL GOOD FORTUNE. I SUPPOSE NO DOCTOR EVER CAMENEWLY TO A PLACE WITHOUT MAKING CURES THAT SURPRISED SOMEBODYCURESWHICH MAY BE CALLED FORTUNES TESTIMONIALS AND DESERVE AS MUCH CREDITAS THE WRITTEN OR PRINTED KIND. VARIOUS PATIENTS GOT WELL WHILE LYDGATEWAS ATTENDING THEM SOME EVEN OF DANGEROUS ILLNESSES AND IT WASREMARKED THAT THE NEW DOCTOR WITH HIS NEW WAYS HAD AT LEAST THE MERITOF BRINGING PEOPLE BACK FROM THE BRINK OF DEATH. THE TRASH TALKED ONSUCH OCCASIONS WAS THE MORE VEXATIOUS TO LYDGATE BECAUSE IT GAVEPRECISELY THE SORT OF PRESTIGE WHICH AN INCOMPETENT AND UNSCRUPULOUSMAN WOULD DESIRE AND WAS SURE TO BE IMPUTED TO HIM BY THE SIMMERINGDISLIKE OF THE OTHER MEDICAL MEN AS AN ENCOURAGEMENT ON HIS OWN PART OFIGNORANT PUFFING. BUT EVEN HIS PROUD OUTSPOKENNESS WAS CHECKED BY THEDISCERNMENT THAT IT WAS AS USELESS TO FIGHT AGAINST THE INTERPRETATIONSOF IGNORANCE AS TO WHIP THE FOG AND GOOD FORTUNE INSISTED ON USINGTHOSE INTERPRETATIONS.MRS. LARCHER HAVING JUST BECOME CHARITABLY CONCERNED ABOUT ALARMINGSYMPTOMS IN HER CHARWOMAN WHEN DR. MINCHIN CALLED ASKED HIM TO SEEHER THEN AND THERE AND TO GIVE HER A CERTIFICATE FOR THE INFIRMARYWHEREUPON AFTER EXAMINATION HE WROTE A STATEMENT OF THE CASE AS ONE OFTUMOR AND RECOMMENDED THE BEARER NANCY NASH AS AN OUTPATIENT. NANCYCALLING AT HOME ON HER WAY TO THE INFIRMARY ALLOWED THE STAY MAKER ANDHIS WIFE IN WHOSE ATTIC SHE LODGED TO READ DR. MINCHINS PAPER ANDBY THIS MEANS BECAME A SUBJECT OF COMPASSIONATE CONVERSATION IN THENEIGHBORING SHOPS OF CHURCHYARD LANE AS BEING AFFLICTED WITH A TUMOR ATFIRST DECLARED TO BE AS LARGE AND HARD AS A DUCKS EGG BUT LATER INTHE DAY TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF YOUR FIST. MOST HEARERS AGREED THATIT WOULD HAVE TO BE CUT OUT BUT ONE HAD KNOWN OF OIL AND ANOTHER OFSQUITCHINEAL AS ADEQUATE TO SOFTEN AND REDUCE ANY LUMP IN THE BODYWHEN TAKEN ENOUGH OF INTO THE INSIDETHE OIL BY GRADUALLY SOOPLINGTHE SQUITCHINEAL BY EATING AWAY.MEANWHILE WHEN NANCY PRESENTED HERSELF AT THE INFIRMARY IT HAPPENED TOBE ONE OF LYDGATES DAYS THERE. AFTER QUESTIONING AND EXAMINING HERLYDGATE SAID TO THE HOUSESURGEON IN AN UNDERTONE ITS NOT TUMORITS CRAMP. HE ORDERED HER A BLISTER AND SOME STEEL MIXTURE AND TOLDHER TO GO HOME AND REST GIVING HER AT THE SAME TIME A NOTE TO MRS.LARCHER WHO SHE SAID WAS HER BEST EMPLOYER TO TESTIFY THAT SHE WASIN NEED OF GOOD FOOD.BUT BYANDBY NANCY IN HER ATTIC BECAME PORTENTOUSLY WORSE THESUPPOSED TUMOR HAVING INDEED GIVEN WAY TO THE BLISTER BUT ONLYWANDERED TO ANOTHER REGION WITH ANGRIER PAIN. THE STAYMAKERS WIFE WENTTO FETCH LYDGATE AND HE CONTINUED FOR A FORTNIGHT TO ATTEND NANCY INHER OWN HOME UNTIL UNDER HIS TREATMENT SHE GOT QUITE WELL AND WENT TOWORK AGAIN. BUT THE CASE CONTINUED TO BE DESCRIBED AS ONE OF TUMOR INCHURCHYARD LANE AND OTHER STREETSNAY BY MRS. LARCHER ALSO FOR WHENLYDGATES REMARKABLE CURE WAS MENTIONED TO DR. MINCHIN HE NATURALLYDID NOT LIKE TO SAY THE CASE WAS NOT ONE OF TUMOR AND I WAS MISTAKENIN DESCRIBING IT AS SUCH BUT ANSWERED INDEED AH I SAW IT WAS ASURGICAL CASE NOT OF A FATAL KIND. HE HAD BEEN INWARDLY ANNOYEDHOWEVER WHEN HE HAD ASKED AT THE INFIRMARY ABOUT THE WOMAN HE HADRECOMMENDED TWO DAYS BEFORE TO HEAR FROM THE HOUSESURGEON AYOUNGSTER WHO WAS NOT SORRY TO VEX MINCHIN WITH IMPUNITY EXACTLY WHATHAD OCCURRED HE PRIVATELY PRONOUNCED THAT IT WAS INDECENT IN A GENERALPRACTITIONER TO CONTRADICT A PHYSICIANS DIAGNOSIS IN THAT OPEN MANNERAND AFTERWARDS AGREED WITH WRENCH THAT LYDGATE WAS DISAGREEABLYINATTENTIVE TO ETIQUETTE. LYDGATE DID NOT MAKE THE AFFAIR A GROUND FORVALUING HIMSELF OR VERY PARTICULARLY DESPISING MINCHIN SUCHRECTIFICATION OF MISJUDGMENTS OFTEN HAPPENING AMONG MEN OF EQUALQUALIFICATIONS. BUT REPORT TOOK UP THIS AMAZING CASE OF TUMOR NOTCLEARLY DISTINGUISHED FROM CANCER AND CONSIDERED THE MORE AWFUL FORBEING OF THE WANDERING SORT TILL MUCH PREJUDICE AGAINST LYDGATESMETHOD AS TO DRUGS WAS OVERCOME BY THE PROOF OF HIS MARVELLOUS SKILL INTHE SPEEDY RESTORATION OF NANCY NASH AFTER SHE HAD BEEN ROLLING ANDROLLING IN AGONIES FROM THE PRESENCE OF A TUMOR BOTH HARD ANDOBSTINATE BUT NEVERTHELESS COMPELLED TO YIELD.HOW COULD LYDGATE HELP HIMSELF IT IS OFFENSIVE TO TELL A LADY WHEN SHEIS EXPRESSING HER AMAZEMENT AT YOUR SKILL THAT SHE IS ALTOGETHERMISTAKEN AND RATHER FOOLISH IN HER AMAZEMENT. AND TO HAVE ENTERED INTOTHE NATURE OF DISEASES WOULD ONLY HAVE ADDED TO HIS BREACHES OF MEDICALPROPRIETY. THUS HE HAD TO WINCE UNDER A PROMISE OF SUCCESS GIVEN BYTHAT IGNORANT PRAISE WHICH MISSES EVERY VALID QUALITY.IN THE CASE OF A MORE CONSPICUOUS PATIENT MR. BORTHROP TRUMBULLLYDGATE WAS CONSCIOUS OF HAVING SHOWN HIMSELF SOMETHING BETTER THAN ANEVERYDAY DOCTOR THOUGH HERE TOO IT WAS AN EQUIVOCAL ADVANTAGE THAT HEWON. THE ELOQUENT AUCTIONEER WAS SEIZED WITH PNEUMONIA AND HAVING BEENA PATIENT OF MR. PEACOCKS SENT FOR LYDGATE WHOM HE HAD EXPRESSED HISINTENTION TO PATRONIZE. MR TRUMBULL WAS A ROBUST MAN A GOOD SUBJECTFOR TRYING THE EXPECTANT THEORY UPONWATCHING THE COURSE OF ANINTERESTING DISEASE WHEN LEFT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO ITSELF SO THATTHE STAGES MIGHT BE NOTED FOR FUTURE GUIDANCE AND FROM THE AIR WITHWHICH HE DESCRIBED HIS SENSATIONS LYDGATE SURMISED THAT HE WOULD LIKETO BE TAKEN INTO HIS MEDICAL MANS CONFIDENCE AND BE REPRESENTED AS APARTNER IN HIS OWN CURE. THE AUCTIONEER HEARD WITHOUT MUCH SURPRISETHAT HIS WAS A CONSTITUTION WHICH ALWAYS WITH DUE WATCHING MIGHT BELEFT TO ITSELF SO AS TO OFFER A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE OF A DISEASE WITHALL ITS PHASES SEEN IN CLEAR DELINEATION AND THAT HE PROBABLY HAD THERARE STRENGTH OF MIND VOLUNTARILY TO BECOME THE TEST OF A RATIONALPROCEDURE AND THUS MAKE THE DISORDER OF HIS PULMONARY FUNCTIONS AGENERAL BENEFIT TO SOCIETY.MR. TRUMBULL ACQUIESCED AT ONCE AND ENTERED STRONGLY INTO THE VIEWTHAT AN ILLNESS OF HIS WAS NO ORDINARY OCCASION FOR MEDICAL SCIENCE.NEVER FEAR SIR YOU ARE NOT SPEAKING TO ONE WHO IS ALTOGETHERIGNORANT OF THE VIS MEDICATRIX SAID HE WITH HIS USUAL SUPERIORITYOF EXPRESSION MADE RATHER PATHETIC BY DIFFICULTY OF BREATHING. AND HEWENT WITHOUT SHRINKING THROUGH HIS ABSTINENCE FROM DRUGS MUCHSUSTAINED BY APPLICATION OF THE THERMOMETER WHICH IMPLIED THEIMPORTANCE OF HIS TEMPERATURE BY THE SENSE THAT HE FURNISHED OBJECTSFOR THE MICROSCOPE AND BY LEARNING MANY NEW WORDS WHICH SEEMED SUITEDTO THE DIGNITY OF HIS SECRETIONS. FOR LYDGATE WAS ACUTE ENOUGH TOINDULGE HIM WITH A LITTLE TECHNICAL TALK.IT MAY BE IMAGINED THAT MR. TRUMBULL ROSE FROM HIS COUCH WITH ADISPOSITION TO SPEAK OF AN ILLNESS IN WHICH HE HAD MANIFESTED THESTRENGTH OF HIS MIND AS WELL AS CONSTITUTION AND HE WAS NOT BACKWARDIN AWARDING CREDIT TO THE MEDICAL MAN WHO HAD DISCERNED THE QUALITY OFPATIENT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH. THE AUCTIONEER WAS NOT AN UNGENEROUS MANAND LIKED TO GIVE OTHERS THEIR DUE FEELING THAT HE COULD AFFORD IT. HEHAD CAUGHT THE WORDS EXPECTANT METHOD AND RANG CHIMES ON THIS ANDOTHER LEARNED PHRASES TO ACCOMPANY THE ASSURANCE THAT LYDGATE KNEW ATHING OR TWO MORE THAN THE REST OF THE DOCTORSWAS FAR BETTER VERSED INTHE SECRETS OF HIS PROFESSION THAN THE MAJORITY OF HIS COMPEERS.THIS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE THE AFFAIR OF FRED VINCYS ILLNESS HAD GIVENTO MR. WRENCHS ENMITY TOWARDS LYDGATE MORE DEFINITE PERSONAL GROUND.THE NEWCOMER ALREADY THREATENED TO BE A NUISANCE IN THE SHAPE OFRIVALRY AND WAS CERTAINLY A NUISANCE IN THE SHAPE OF PRACTICALCRITICISM OR REFLECTIONS ON HIS HARDDRIVEN ELDERS WHO HAD HADSOMETHING ELSE TO DO THAN TO BUSY THEMSELVES WITH UNTRIED NOTIONS. HISPRACTICE HAD SPREAD IN ONE OR TWO QUARTERS AND FROM THE FIRST THEREPORT OF HIS HIGH FAMILY HAD LED TO HIS BEING PRETTY GENERALLYINVITED SO THAT THE OTHER MEDICAL MEN HAD TO MEET HIM AT DINNER IN THEBEST HOUSES AND HAVING TO MEET A MAN WHOM YOU DISLIKE IS NOT OBSERVEDALWAYS TO END IN A MUTUAL ATTACHMENT. THERE WAS HARDLY EVER SO MUCHUNANIMITY AMONG THEM AS IN THE OPINION THAT LYDGATE WAS AN ARROGANTYOUNG FELLOW AND YET READY FOR THE SAKE OF ULTIMATELY PREDOMINATING TOSHOW A CRAWLING SUBSERVIENCE TO BULSTRODE. THAT MR. FAREBROTHER WHOSENAME WAS A CHIEF FLAG OF THE ANTIBULSTRODE PARTY ALWAYS DEFENDEDLYDGATE AND MADE A FRIEND OF HIM WAS REFERRED TO FAREBROTHERSUNACCOUNTABLE WAY OF FIGHTING ON BOTH SIDES.HERE WAS PLENTY OF PREPARATION FOR THE OUTBURST OF PROFESSIONAL DISGUSTAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE LAWS MR. BULSTRODE WAS LAYING DOWN FOR THEDIRECTION OF THE NEW HOSPITAL WHICH WERE THE MORE EXASPERATING BECAUSETHERE WAS NO PRESENT POSSIBILITY OF INTERFERING WITH HIS WILL ANDPLEASURE EVERYBODY EXCEPT LORD MEDLICOTE HAVING REFUSED HELP TOWARDSTHE BUILDING ON THE GROUND THAT THEY PREFERRED GIVING TO THE OLDINFIRMARY. MR. BULSTRODE MET ALL THE EXPENSES AND HAD CEASED TO BESORRY THAT HE WAS PURCHASING THE RIGHT TO CARRY OUT HIS NOTIONS OFIMPROVEMENT WITHOUT HINDRANCE FROM PREJUDICED COADJUTORS BUT HE HADHAD TO SPEND LARGE SUMS AND THE BUILDING HAD LINGERED. CALEB GARTH HADUNDERTAKEN IT HAD FAILED DURING ITS PROGRESS AND BEFORE THE INTERIORFITTINGS WERE BEGUN HAD RETIRED FROM THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BUSINESSAND WHEN REFERRING TO THE HOSPITAL HE OFTEN SAID THAT HOWEVER BULSTRODEMIGHT RING IF YOU TRIED HIM HE LIKED GOOD SOLID CARPENTRY AND MASONRYAND HAD A NOTION BOTH OF DRAINS AND CHIMNEYS. IN FACT THE HOSPITAL HADBECOME AN OBJECT OF INTENSE INTEREST TO BULSTRODE AND HE WOULDWILLINGLY HAVE CONTINUED TO SPARE A LARGE YEARLY SUM THAT HE MIGHT RULEIT DICTATORIALLY WITHOUT ANY BOARD BUT HE HAD ANOTHER FAVORITE OBJECTWHICH ALSO REQUIRED MONEY FOR ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT HE WISHED TO BUY SOMELAND IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MIDDLEMARCH AND THEREFORE HE WISHED TO GETCONSIDERABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS MAINTAINING THE HOSPITAL. MEANWHILEHE FRAMED HIS PLAN OF MANAGEMENT. THE HOSPITAL WAS TO BE RESERVED FORFEVER IN ALL ITS FORMS LYDGATE WAS TO BE CHIEF MEDICAL SUPERINTENDENTTHAT HE MIGHT HAVE FREE AUTHORITY TO PURSUE ALL COMPARATIVEINVESTIGATIONS WHICH HIS STUDIES PARTICULARLY IN PARIS HAD SHOWN HIMTHE IMPORTANCE OF THE OTHER MEDICAL VISITORS HAVING A CONSULTATIVEINFLUENCE BUT NO POWER TO CONTRAVENE LYDGATES ULTIMATE DECISIONS ANDTHE GENERAL MANAGEMENT WAS TO BE LODGED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE HANDS OFFIVE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATED WITH MR. BULSTRODE WHO WERE TO HAVE VOTES INTHE RATIO OF THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS THE BOARD ITSELF FILLING UP ANYVACANCY IN ITS NUMBERS AND NO MOB OF SMALL CONTRIBUTORS BEING ADMITTEDTO A SHARE OF GOVERNMENT.THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATE REFUSAL ON THE PART OF EVERY MEDICAL MAN IN THETOWN TO BECOME A VISITOR AT THE FEVER HOSPITAL.VERY WELL SAID LYDGATE TO MR. BULSTRODE WE HAVE A CAPITALHOUSESURGEON AND DISPENSER A CLEARHEADED NEATHANDED FELLOW WELLGET WEBBE FROM CRABSLEY AS GOOD A COUNTRY PRACTITIONER AS ANY OF THEMTO COME OVER TWICE AWEEK AND IN CASE OF ANY EXCEPTIONAL OPERATIONPROTHEROE WILL COME FROM BRASSING. I MUST WORK THE HARDER THATS ALLAND I HAVE GIVEN UP MY POST AT THE INFIRMARY. THE PLAN WILL FLOURISH INSPITE OF THEM AND THEN THEYLL BE GLAD TO COME IN. THINGS CANT LASTAS THEY ARE THERE MUST BE ALL SORTS OF REFORM SOON AND THEN YOUNGFELLOWS MAY BE GLAD TO COME AND STUDY HERE. LYDGATE WAS IN HIGHSPIRITS.I SHALL NOT FLINCH YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT MR. LYDGATE SAID MR.BULSTRODE. WHILE I SEE YOU CARRYING OUT HIGH INTENTIONS WITH VIGORYOU SHALL HAVE MY UNFAILING SUPPORT. AND I HAVE HUMBLE CONFIDENCE THATTHE BLESSING WHICH HAS HITHERTO ATTENDED MY EFFORTS AGAINST THE SPIRITOF EVIL IN THIS TOWN WILL NOT BE WITHDRAWN. SUITABLE DIRECTORS TOASSIST ME I HAVE NO DOUBT OF SECURING. MR. BROOKE OF TIPTON HAS ALREADYGIVEN ME HIS CONCURRENCE AND A PLEDGE TO CONTRIBUTE YEARLY HE HAS NOTSPECIFIED THE SUMPROBABLY NOT A GREAT ONE. BUT HE WILL BE A USEFULMEMBER OF THE BOARD.A USEFUL MEMBER WAS PERHAPS TO BE DEFINED AS ONE WHO WOULD ORIGINATENOTHING AND ALWAYS VOTE WITH MR. BULSTRODE.THE MEDICAL AVERSION TO LYDGATE WAS HARDLY DISGUISED NOW. NEITHER DR.SPRAGUE NOR DR. MINCHIN SAID THAT HE DISLIKED LYDGATES KNOWLEDGE ORHIS DISPOSITION TO IMPROVE TREATMENT WHAT THEY DISLIKED WAS HISARROGANCE WHICH NOBODY FELT TO BE ALTOGETHER DENIABLE. THEY IMPLIEDTHAT HE WAS INSOLENT PRETENTIOUS AND GIVEN TO THAT RECKLESSINNOVATION FOR THE SAKE OF NOISE AND SHOW WHICH WAS THE ESSENCE OF THECHARLATAN.THE WORD CHARLATAN ONCE THROWN ON THE AIR COULD NOT BE LET DROP. INTHOSE DAYS THE WORLD WAS AGITATED ABOUT THE WONDROUS DOINGS OF MR. ST.JOHN LONG NOBLEMEN AND GENTLEMEN ATTESTING HIS EXTRACTION OF A FLUIDLIKE MERCURY FROM THE TEMPLES OF A PATIENT.MR. TOLLER REMARKED ONE DAY SMILINGLY TO MRS. TAFT THAT BULSTRODEHAD FOUND A MAN TO SUIT HIM IN LYDGATE A CHARLATAN IN RELIGION IS SURETO LIKE OTHER SORTS OF CHARLATANS.YES INDEED I CAN IMAGINE SAID MRS. TAFT KEEPING THE NUMBER OFTHIRTY STITCHES CAREFULLY IN HER MIND ALL THE WHILE THERE ARE SO MANYOF THAT SORT. I REMEMBER MR. CHESHIRE WITH HIS IRONS TRYING TO MAKEPEOPLE STRAIGHT WHEN THE ALMIGHTY HAD MADE THEM CROOKED.NO NO SAID MR. TOLLER CHESHIRE WAS ALL RIGHTALL FAIR AND ABOVEBOARD. BUT THERES ST. JOHN LONGTHATS THE KIND OF FELLOW WE CALL ACHARLATAN ADVERTISING CURES IN WAYS NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT AFELLOW WHO WANTS TO MAKE A NOISE BY PRETENDING TO GO DEEPER THAN OTHERPEOPLE. THE OTHER DAY HE WAS PRETENDING TO TAP A MANS BRAIN AND GETQUICKSILVER OUT OF IT.GOOD GRACIOUS WHAT DREADFUL TRIFLING WITH PEOPLES CONSTITUTIONSSAID MRS. TAFT.AFTER THIS IT CAME TO BE HELD IN VARIOUS QUARTERS THAT LYDGATE PLAYEDEVEN WITH RESPECTABLE CONSTITUTIONS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES AND HOW MUCHMORE LIKELY THAT IN HIS FLIGHTY EXPERIMENTING HE SHOULD MAKE SIXES ANDSEVENS OF HOSPITAL PATIENTS. ESPECIALLY IT WAS TO BE EXPECTED AS THELANDLADY OF THE TANKARD HAD SAID THAT HE WOULD RECKLESSLY CUT UP THEIRDEAD BODIES. FOR LYDGATE HAVING ATTENDED MRS. GOBY WHO DIED APPARENTLYOF A HEARTDISEASE NOT VERY CLEARLY EXPRESSED IN THE SYMPTOMS TOODARINGLY ASKED LEAVE OF HER RELATIVES TO OPEN THE BODY AND THUS GAVEAN OFFENCE QUICKLY SPREADING BEYOND PARLEY STREET WHERE THAT LADY HADLONG RESIDED ON AN INCOME SUCH AS MADE THIS ASSOCIATION OF HER BODYWITH THE VICTIMS OF BURKE AND HARE A FLAGRANT INSULT TO HER MEMORY.AFFAIRS WERE IN THIS STAGE WHEN LYDGATE OPENED THE SUBJECT OF THEHOSPITAL TO DOROTHEA. WE SEE THAT HE WAS BEARING ENMITY AND SILLYMISCONCEPTION WITH MUCH SPIRIT AWARE THAT THEY WERE PARTLY CREATED BYHIS GOOD SHARE OF SUCCESS.THEY WILL NOT DRIVE ME AWAY HE SAID TALKING CONFIDENTIALLY IN MR.FAREBROTHERS STUDY. I HAVE GOT A GOOD OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR THE ENDSI CARE MOST ABOUT AND I AM PRETTY SURE TO GET INCOME ENOUGH FOR OURWANTS. BYANDBY I SHALL GO ON AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE I HAVE NOSEDUCTIONS NOW AWAY FROM HOME AND WORK. AND I AM MORE AND MORECONVINCED THAT IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE HOMOGENEOUSORIGIN OF ALL THE TISSUES. RASPAIL AND OTHERS ARE ON THE SAME TRACKAND I HAVE BEEN LOSING TIME.I HAVE NO POWER OF PROPHECY THERE SAID MR. FAREBROTHER WHO HAD BEENPUFFING AT HIS PIPE THOUGHTFULLY WHILE LYDGATE TALKED BUT AS TO THEHOSTILITY IN THE TOWN YOULL WEATHER IT IF YOU ARE PRUDENT.HOW AM I TO BE PRUDENT SAID LYDGATE I JUST DO WHAT COMES BEFORE METO DO. I CANT HELP PEOPLES IGNORANCE AND SPITE ANY MORE THANVESALIUS COULD. IT ISNT POSSIBLE TO SQUARE ONES CONDUCT TO SILLYCONCLUSIONS WHICH NOBODY CAN FORESEE.QUITE TRUE I DIDNT MEAN THAT. I MEANT ONLY TWO THINGS. ONE IS KEEPYOURSELF AS SEPARABLE FROM BULSTRODE AS YOU CAN OF COURSE YOU CAN GOON DOING GOOD WORK OF YOUR OWN BY HIS HELP BUT DONT GET TIED. PERHAPSIT SEEMS LIKE PERSONAL FEELING IN ME TO SAY SOAND THERES A GOOD DEALOF THAT I OWNBUT PERSONAL FEELING IS NOT ALWAYS IN THE WRONG IF YOUBOIL IT DOWN TO THE IMPRESSIONS WHICH MAKE IT SIMPLY AN OPINION.BULSTRODE IS NOTHING TO ME SAID LYDGATE CARELESSLY EXCEPT ONPUBLIC GROUNDS. AS TO GETTING VERY CLOSELY UNITED TO HIM I AM NOT FONDENOUGH OF HIM FOR THAT. BUT WHAT WAS THE OTHER THING YOU MEANT SAIDLYDGATE WHO WAS NURSING HIS LEG AS COMFORTABLY AS POSSIBLE ANDFEELING IN NO GREAT NEED OF ADVICE.WHY THIS. TAKE CAREEXPERTO CREDETAKE CARE NOT TO GET HAMPEREDABOUT MONEY MATTERS. I KNOW BY A WORD YOU LET FALL ONE DAY THAT YOUDONT LIKE MY PLAYING AT CARDS SO MUCH FOR MONEY. YOU ARE RIGHT ENOUGHTHERE. BUT TRY AND KEEP CLEAR OF WANTING SMALL SUMS THAT YOU HAVENTGOT. I AM PERHAPS TALKING RATHER SUPERFLUOUSLY BUT A MAN LIKES TOASSUME SUPERIORITY OVER HIMSELF BY HOLDING UP HIS BAD EXAMPLE ANDSERMONIZING ON IT.LYDGATE TOOK MR. FAREBROTHERS HINTS VERY CORDIALLY THOUGH HE WOULDHARDLY HAVE BORNE THEM FROM ANOTHER MAN. HE COULD NOT HELP REMEMBERINGTHAT HE HAD LATELY MADE SOME DEBTS BUT THESE HAD SEEMED INEVITABLEAND HE HAD NO INTENTION NOW TO DO MORE THAN KEEP HOUSE IN A SIMPLE WAY.THE FURNITURE FOR WHICH HE OWED WOULD NOT WANT RENEWING NOR EVEN THESTOCK OF WINE FOR A LONG WHILE.MANY THOUGHTS CHEERED HIM AT THAT TIMEAND JUSTLY. A MAN CONSCIOUS OFENTHUSIASM FOR WORTHY AIMS IS SUSTAINED UNDER PETTY HOSTILITIES BY THEMEMORY OF GREAT WORKERS WHO HAD TO FIGHT THEIR WAY NOT WITHOUT WOUNDSAND WHO HOVER IN HIS MIND AS PATRON SAINTS INVISIBLY HELPING. AT HOMETHAT SAME EVENING WHEN HE HAD BEEN CHATTING WITH MR. FAREBROTHER HEHAD HIS LONG LEGS STRETCHED ON THE SOFA HIS HEAD THROWN BACK AND HISHANDS CLASPED BEHIND IT ACCORDING TO HIS FAVORITE RUMINATING ATTITUDEWHILE ROSAMOND SAT AT THE PIANO AND PLAYED ONE TUNE AFTER ANOTHER OFWHICH HER HUSBAND ONLY KNEW LIKE THE EMOTIONAL ELEPHANT HE WAS THATTHEY FELL IN WITH HIS MOOD AS IF THEY HAD BEEN MELODIOUS SEABREEZES.THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY FINE IN LYDGATES LOOK JUST THEN AND ANY ONEMIGHT HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED TO BET ON HIS ACHIEVEMENT. IN HIS DARK EYESAND ON HIS MOUTH AND BROW THERE WAS THAT PLACIDITY WHICH COMES FROM THEFULNESS OF CONTEMPLATIVE THOUGHTTHE MIND NOT SEARCHING BUT BEHOLDINGAND THE GLANCE SEEMING TO BE FILLED WITH WHAT IS BEHIND IT.PRESENTLY ROSAMOND LEFT THE PIANO AND SEATED HERSELF ON A CHAIR CLOSETO THE SOFA AND OPPOSITE HER HUSBANDS FACE.IS THAT ENOUGH MUSIC FOR YOU MY LORD SHE SAID FOLDING HER HANDSBEFORE HER AND PUTTING ON A LITTLE AIR OF MEEKNESS.YES DEAR IF YOU ARE TIRED SAID LYDGATE GENTLY TURNING HIS EYESAND RESTING THEM ON HER BUT NOT OTHERWISE MOVING. ROSAMONDS PRESENCEAT THAT MOMENT WAS PERHAPS NO MORE THAN A SPOONFUL BROUGHT TO THE LAKEAND HER WOMANS INSTINCT IN THIS MATTER WAS NOT DULL.WHAT IS ABSORBING YOU SHE SAID LEANING FORWARD AND BRINGING HERFACE NEARER TO HIS.HE MOVED HIS HANDS AND PLACED THEM GENTLY BEHIND HER SHOULDERS.I AM THINKING OF A GREAT FELLOW WHO WAS ABOUT AS OLD AS I AM THREEHUNDRED YEARS AGO AND HAD ALREADY BEGUN A NEW ERA IN ANATOMY.I CANT GUESS SAID ROSAMOND SHAKING HER HEAD. WE USED TO PLAY ATGUESSING HISTORICAL CHARACTERS AT MRS. LEMONS BUT NOT ANATOMISTS.ILL TELL YOU. HIS NAME WAS VESALIUS. AND THE ONLY WAY HE COULD GET TOKNOW ANATOMY AS HE DID WAS BY GOING TO SNATCH BODIES AT NIGHT FROMGRAVEYARDS AND PLACES OF EXECUTION.OH SAID ROSAMOND WITH A LOOK OF DISGUST ON HER PRETTY FACE I AMVERY GLAD YOU ARE NOT VESALIUS. I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE MIGHT FINDSOME LESS HORRIBLE WAY THAN THAT.NO HE COULDNT SAID LYDGATE GOING ON TOO EARNESTLY TO TAKE MUCHNOTICE OF HER ANSWER. HE COULD ONLY GET A COMPLETE SKELETON BYSNATCHING THE WHITENED BONES OF A CRIMINAL FROM THE GALLOWS ANDBURYING THEM AND FETCHING THEM AWAY BY BITS SECRETLY IN THE DEAD OFNIGHT.I HOPE HE IS NOT ONE OF YOUR GREAT HEROES SAID ROSAMOND HALFPLAYFULLY HALF ANXIOUSLY ELSE I SHALL HAVE YOU GETTING UP IN THENIGHT TO GO TO ST. PETERS CHURCHYARD. YOU KNOW HOW ANGRY YOU TOLD METHE PEOPLE WERE ABOUT MRS. GOBY. YOU HAVE ENEMIES ENOUGH ALREADY.SO HAD VESALIUS ROSY. NO WONDER THE MEDICAL FOGIES IN MIDDLEMARCH AREJEALOUS WHEN SOME OF THE GREATEST DOCTORS LIVING WERE FIERCE UPONVESALIUS BECAUSE THEY HAD BELIEVED IN GALEN AND HE SHOWED THAT GALENWAS WRONG. THEY CALLED HIM A LIAR AND A POISONOUS MONSTER. BUT THEFACTS OF THE HUMAN FRAME WERE ON HIS SIDE AND SO HE GOT THE BETTER OFTHEM.AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AFTERWARDS SAID ROSAMOND WITH SOMEINTEREST.OH HE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF FIGHTING TO THE LAST. AND THEY DIDEXASPERATE HIM ENOUGH AT ONE TIME TO MAKE HIM BURN A GOOD DEAL OF HISWORK. THEN HE GOT SHIPWRECKED JUST AS HE WAS COMING FROM JERUSALEM TOTAKE A GREAT CHAIR AT PADUA. HE DIED RATHER MISERABLY.THERE WAS A MOMENTS PAUSE BEFORE ROSAMOND SAID DO YOU KNOW TERTIUSI OFTEN WISH YOU HAD NOT BEEN A MEDICAL MAN.NAY ROSY DONT SAY THAT SAID LYDGATE DRAWING HER CLOSER TO HIM.THAT IS LIKE SAYING YOU WISH YOU HAD MARRIED ANOTHER MAN.NOT AT ALL YOU ARE CLEVER ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING YOU MIGHT EASILY HAVEBEEN SOMETHING ELSE. AND YOUR COUSINS AT QUALLINGHAM ALL THINK THAT YOUHAVE SUNK BELOW THEM IN YOUR CHOICE OF A PROFESSION.THE COUSINS AT QUALLINGHAM MAY GO TO THE DEVIL SAID LYDGATE WITHSCORN. IT WAS LIKE THEIR IMPUDENCE IF THEY SAID ANYTHING OF THE SORTTO YOU.STILL SAID ROSAMOND I DO NOT THINK IT IS A NICE PROFESSIONDEAR. WE KNOW THAT SHE HAD MUCH QUIET PERSEVERANCE IN HER OPINION.IT IS THE GRANDEST PROFESSION IN THE WORLD ROSAMOND SAID LYDGATEGRAVELY. AND TO SAY THAT YOU LOVE ME WITHOUT LOVING THE MEDICAL MAN INME IS THE SAME SORT OF THING AS TO SAY THAT YOU LIKE EATING A PEACHBUT DONT LIKE ITS FLAVOR. DONT SAY THAT AGAIN DEAR IT PAINS ME.VERY WELL DOCTOR GRAVEFACE SAID ROSY DIMPLING I WILL DECLARE INFUTURE THAT I DOTE ON SKELETONS AND BODYSNATCHERS AND BITS OF THINGSIN PHIALS AND QUARRELS WITH EVERYBODY THAT END IN YOUR DYINGMISERABLY.NO NO NOT SO BAD AS THAT SAID LYDGATE GIVING UP REMONSTRANCE ANDPETTING HER RESIGNEDLY.CHAPTER XLVI.PUES NO PODEMOS HABER AQUELLO QUE QUEREMOS QUERAMOS AQUELLO QUEPODREMOS.SINCE WE CANNOT GET WHAT WE LIKE LET US LIKE WHAT WE CAN GET.SPANISHPROVERB.WHILE LYDGATE SAFELY MARRIED AND WITH THE HOSPITAL UNDER HIS COMMANDFELT HIMSELF STRUGGLING FOR MEDICAL REFORM AGAINST MIDDLEMARCHMIDDLEMARCH WAS BECOMING MORE AND MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE NATIONALSTRUGGLE FOR ANOTHER KIND OF REFORM.BY THE TIME THAT LORD JOHN RUSSELLS MEASURE WAS BEING DEBATED IN THEHOUSE OF COMMONS THERE WAS A NEW POLITICAL ANIMATION IN MIDDLEMARCHAND A NEW DEFINITION OF PARTIES WHICH MIGHT SHOW A DECIDED CHANGE OFBALANCE IF A NEW ELECTION CAME. AND THERE WERE SOME WHO ALREADYPREDICTED THIS EVENT DECLARING THAT A REFORM BILL WOULD NEVER BECARRIED BY THE ACTUAL PARLIAMENT. THIS WAS WHAT WILL LADISLAW DWELT ONTO MR. BROOKE AS A REASON FOR CONGRATULATION THAT HE HAD NOT YET TRIEDHIS STRENGTH AT THE HUSTINGS.THINGS WILL GROW AND RIPEN AS IF IT WERE A COMET YEAR SAID WILL.THE PUBLIC TEMPER WILL SOON GET TO A COMETARY HEAT NOW THE QUESTIONOF REFORM HAS SET IN. THERE IS LIKELY TO BE ANOTHER ELECTION BEFORELONG AND BY THAT TIME MIDDLEMARCH WILL HAVE GOT MORE IDEAS INTO ITSHEAD. WHAT WE HAVE TO WORK AT NOW IS THE PIONEER AND POLITICALMEETINGS.QUITE RIGHT LADISLAW WE SHALL MAKE A NEW THING OF OPINION HERESAID MR. BROOKE. ONLY I WANT TO KEEP MYSELF INDEPENDENT ABOUT REFORMYOU KNOW I DONT WANT TO GO TOO FAR. I WANT TO TAKE UP WILBERFORCESAND ROMILLYS LINE YOU KNOW AND WORK AT NEGRO EMANCIPATION CRIMINALLAWTHAT KIND OF THING. BUT OF COURSE I SHOULD SUPPORT GREY.IF YOU GO IN FOR THE PRINCIPLE OF REFORM YOU MUST BE PREPARED TO TAKEWHAT THE SITUATION OFFERS SAID WILL. IF EVERYBODY PULLED FOR HIS OWNBIT AGAINST EVERYBODY ELSE THE WHOLE QUESTION WOULD GO TO TATTERS.YES YES I AGREE WITH YOUI QUITE TAKE THAT POINT OF VIEW. I SHOULDPUT IT IN THAT LIGHT. I SHOULD SUPPORT GREY YOU KNOW. BUT I DONT WANTTO CHANGE THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION AND I DONT THINK GREYWOULD.BUT THAT IS WHAT THE COUNTRY WANTS SAID WILL. ELSE THERE WOULD BENO MEANING IN POLITICAL UNIONS OR ANY OTHER MOVEMENT THAT KNOWS WHATITS ABOUT. IT WANTS TO HAVE A HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH IS NOT WEIGHTEDWITH NOMINEES OF THE LANDED CLASS BUT WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THEOTHER INTERESTS. AND AS TO CONTENDING FOR A REFORM SHORT OF THAT IT ISLIKE ASKING FOR A BIT OF AN AVALANCHE WHICH HAS ALREADY BEGUN TOTHUNDER.THAT IS FINE LADISLAW THAT IS THE WAY TO PUT IT. WRITE THAT DOWNNOW. WE MUST BEGIN TO GET DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE FEELING OF THE COUNTRYAS WELL AS THE MACHINEBREAKING AND GENERAL DISTRESS.AS TO DOCUMENTS SAID WILL A TWOINCH CARD WILL HOLD PLENTY. A FEWROWS OF FIGURES ARE ENOUGH TO DEDUCE MISERY FROM AND A FEW MORE WILLSHOW THE RATE AT WHICH THE POLITICAL DETERMINATION OF THE PEOPLE ISGROWING.GOOD DRAW THAT OUT A LITTLE MORE AT LENGTH LADISLAW. THAT IS ANIDEA NOW WRITE IT OUT IN THE PIONEER. PUT THE FIGURES AND DEDUCETHE MISERY YOU KNOW AND PUT THE OTHER FIGURES AND DEDUCEAND SO ON.YOU HAVE A WAY OF PUTTING THINGS. BURKE NOWWHEN I THINK OF BURKE ICANT HELP WISHING SOMEBODY HAD A POCKETBOROUGH TO GIVE YOU LADISLAW.YOUD NEVER GET ELECTED YOU KNOW. AND WE SHALL ALWAYS WANT TALENT INTHE HOUSE REFORM AS WE WILL WE SHALL ALWAYS WANT TALENT. THATAVALANCHE AND THE THUNDER NOW WAS REALLY A LITTLE LIKE BURKE. I WANTTHAT SORT OF THINGNOT IDEAS YOU KNOW BUT A WAY OF PUTTING THEM.POCKETBOROUGHS WOULD BE A FINE THING SAID LADISLAW IF THEY WEREALWAYS IN THE RIGHT POCKET AND THERE WERE ALWAYS A BURKE AT HAND.WILL WAS NOT DISPLEASED WITH THAT COMPLIMENTARY COMPARISON EVEN FROMMR. BROOKE FOR IT IS A LITTLE TOO TRYING TO HUMAN FLESH TO BECONSCIOUS OF EXPRESSING ONES SELF BETTER THAN OTHERS AND NEVER TO HAVEIT NOTICED AND IN THE GENERAL DEARTH OF ADMIRATION FOR THE RIGHTTHING EVEN A CHANCE BRAY OF APPLAUSE FALLING EXACTLY IN TIME IS RATHERFORTIFYING. WILL FELT THAT HIS LITERARY REFINEMENTS WERE USUALLY BEYONDTHE LIMITS OF MIDDLEMARCH PERCEPTION NEVERTHELESS HE WAS BEGINNINGTHOROUGHLY TO LIKE THE WORK OF WHICH WHEN HE BEGAN HE HAD SAID TOHIMSELF RATHER LANGUIDLY WHY NOTAND HE STUDIED THE POLITICALSITUATION WITH AS ARDENT AN INTEREST AS HE HAD EVER GIVEN TO POETICMETRES OR MEDIAEVALISM. IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT BUT FOR THE DESIRE TO BEWHERE DOROTHEA WAS AND PERHAPS THE WANT OF KNOWING WHAT ELSE TO DOWILL WOULD NOT AT THIS TIME HAVE BEEN MEDITATING ON THE NEEDS OF THEENGLISH PEOPLE OR CRITICISING ENGLISH STATESMANSHIP HE WOULD PROBABLYHAVE BEEN RAMBLING IN ITALY SKETCHING PLANS FOR SEVERAL DRAMAS TRYINGPROSE AND FINDING IT TOO JEJUNE TRYING VERSE AND FINDING IT TOOARTIFICIAL BEGINNING TO COPY BITS FROM OLD PICTURES LEAVING OFFBECAUSE THEY WERE NO GOOD AND OBSERVING THAT AFTER ALLSELFCULTURE WAS THE PRINCIPAL POINT WHILE IN POLITICS HE WOULD HAVEBEEN SYMPATHIZING WARMLY WITH LIBERTY AND PROGRESS IN GENERAL. OURSENSE OF DUTY MUST OFTEN WAIT FOR SOME WORK WHICH SHALL TAKE THE PLACEOF DILETTANTEISM AND MAKE US FEEL THAT THE QUALITY OF OUR ACTION IS NOTA MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE.LADISLAW HAD NOW ACCEPTED HIS BIT OF WORK THOUGH IT WAS NOT THATINDETERMINATE LOFTIEST THING WHICH HE HAD ONCE DREAMED OF AS ALONEWORTHY OF CONTINUOUS EFFORT. HIS NATURE WARMED EASILY IN THE PRESENCEOF SUBJECTS WHICH WERE VISIBLY MIXED WITH LIFE AND ACTION AND THEEASILY STIRRED REBELLION IN HIM HELPED THE GLOW OF PUBLIC SPIRIT. INSPITE OF MR. CASAUBON AND THE BANISHMENT FROM LOWICK HE WAS RATHERHAPPY GETTING A GREAT DEAL OF FRESH KNOWLEDGE IN A VIVID WAY AND FORPRACTICAL PURPOSES AND MAKING THE PIONEER CELEBRATED AS FAR ASBRASSING NEVER MIND THE SMALLNESS OF THE AREA THE WRITING WAS NOTWORSE THAN MUCH THAT REACHES THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH.MR. BROOKE WAS OCCASIONALLY IRRITATING BUT WILLS IMPATIENCE WASRELIEVED BY THE DIVISION OF HIS TIME BETWEEN VISITS TO THE GRANGE ANDRETREATS TO HIS MIDDLEMARCH LODGINGS WHICH GAVE VARIETY TO HIS LIFE.SHIFT THE PEGS A LITTLE HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND MR. BROOKE MIGHT BEIN THE CABINET WHILE I WAS UNDERSECRETARY. THAT IS THE COMMON ORDEROF THINGS THE LITTLE WAVES MAKE THE LARGE ONES AND ARE OF THE SAMEPATTERN. I AM BETTER HERE THAN IN THE SORT OF LIFE MR. CASAUBON WOULDHAVE TRAINED ME FOR WHERE THE DOING WOULD BE ALL LAID DOWN BY APRECEDENT TOO RIGID FOR ME TO REACT UPON. I DONT CARE FOR PRESTIGE ORHIGH PAY.AS LYDGATE HAD SAID OF HIM HE WAS A SORT OF GYPSY RATHER ENJOYING THESENSE OF BELONGING TO NO CLASS HE HAD A FEELING OF ROMANCE IN HISPOSITION AND A PLEASANT CONSCIOUSNESS OF CREATING A LITTLE SURPRISEWHEREVER HE WENT. THAT SORT OF ENJOYMENT HAD BEEN DISTURBED WHEN HE HADFELT SOME NEW DISTANCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND DOROTHEA IN THEIR ACCIDENTALMEETING AT LYDGATES AND HIS IRRITATION HAD GONE OUT TOWARDS MR.CASAUBON WHO HAD DECLARED BEFOREHAND THAT WILL WOULD LOSE CASTE. INEVER HAD ANY CASTE HE WOULD HAVE SAID IF THAT PROPHECY HAD BEENUTTERED TO HIM AND THE QUICK BLOOD WOULD HAVE COME AND GONE LIKEBREATH IN HIS TRANSPARENT SKIN. BUT IT IS ONE THING TO LIKE DEFIANCEAND ANOTHER THING TO LIKE ITS CONSEQUENCES.MEANWHILE THE TOWN OPINION ABOUT THE NEW EDITOR OF THE PIONEER WASTENDING TO CONFIRM MR. CASAUBONS VIEW. WILLS RELATIONSHIP IN THATDISTINGUISHED QUARTER DID NOT LIKE LYDGATES HIGH CONNECTIONS SERVEAS AN ADVANTAGEOUS INTRODUCTION IF IT WAS RUMORED THAT YOUNG LADISLAWWAS MR. CASAUBONS NEPHEW OR COUSIN IT WAS ALSO RUMORED THAT MR.CASAUBON WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM.BROOKE HAS TAKEN HIM UP SAID MR. HAWLEY BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT NOMAN IN HIS SENSES COULD HAVE EXPECTED. CASAUBON HAS DEVILISH GOODREASONS YOU MAY BE SURE FOR TURNING THE COLD SHOULDER ON A YOUNGFELLOW WHOSE BRINGINGUP HE PAID FOR. JUST LIKE BROOKEONE OF THOSEFELLOWS WHO WOULD PRAISE A CAT TO SELL A HORSE.AND SOME ODDITIES OF WILLS MORE OR LESS POETICAL APPEARED TO SUPPORTMR. KECK THE EDITOR OF THE TRUMPET IN ASSERTING THAT LADISLAW IFTHE TRUTH WERE KNOWN WAS NOT ONLY A POLISH EMISSARY BUT CRACKBRAINEDWHICH ACCOUNTED FOR THE PRETERNATURAL QUICKNESS AND GLIBNESS OF HISSPEECH WHEN HE GOT ON TO A PLATFORMAS HE DID WHENEVER HE HAD ANOPPORTUNITY SPEAKING WITH A FACILITY WHICH CAST REFLECTIONS ON SOLIDENGLISHMEN GENERALLY. IT WAS DISGUSTING TO KECK TO SEE A STRIP OF AFELLOW WITH LIGHT CURLS ROUND HIS HEAD GET UP AND SPEECHIFY BY THEHOUR AGAINST INSTITUTIONS WHICH HAD EXISTED WHEN HE WAS IN HISCRADLE. AND IN A LEADING ARTICLE OF THE TRUMPET KECK CHARACTERIZEDLADISLAWS SPEECH AT A REFORM MEETING AS THE VIOLENCE OF ANENERGUMENA MISERABLE EFFORT TO SHROUD IN THE BRILLIANCY OF FIREWORKSTHE DARING OF IRRESPONSIBLE STATEMENTS AND THE POVERTY OF A KNOWLEDGEWHICH WAS OF THE CHEAPEST AND MOST RECENT DESCRIPTION.THAT WAS A RATTLING ARTICLE YESTERDAY KECK SAID DR. SPRAGUE WITHSARCASTIC INTENTIONS. BUT WHAT IS AN ENERGUMENOH A TERM THAT CAME UP IN THE FRENCH REVOLUTION SAID KECK.THIS DANGEROUS ASPECT OF LADISLAW WAS STRANGELY CONTRASTED WITH OTHERHABITS WHICH BECAME MATTER OF REMARK. HE HAD A FONDNESS HALF ARTISTICHALF AFFECTIONATE FOR LITTLE CHILDRENTHE SMALLER THEY WERE ONTOLERABLY ACTIVE LEGS AND THE FUNNIER THEIR CLOTHING THE BETTER WILLLIKED TO SURPRISE AND PLEASE THEM. WE KNOW THAT IN ROME HE WAS GIVEN TORAMBLE ABOUT AMONG THE POOR PEOPLE AND THE TASTE DID NOT QUIT HIM INMIDDLEMARCH.HE HAD SOMEHOW PICKED UP A TROOP OF DROLL CHILDREN LITTLE HATLESS BOYSWITH THEIR GALLIGASKINS MUCH WORN AND SCANT SHIRTING TO HANG OUTLITTLE GIRLS WHO TOSSED THEIR HAIR OUT OF THEIR EYES TO LOOK AT HIMAND GUARDIAN BROTHERS AT THE MATURE AGE OF SEVEN. THIS TROOP HE HAD LEDOUT ON GYPSY EXCURSIONS TO HALSELL WOOD AT NUTTINGTIME AND SINCE THECOLD WEATHER HAD SET IN HE HAD TAKEN THEM ON A CLEAR DAY TO GATHERSTICKS FOR A BONFIRE IN THE HOLLOW OF A HILLSIDE WHERE HE DREW OUT ASMALL FEAST OF GINGERBREAD FOR THEM AND IMPROVISED A PUNCHANDJUDYDRAMA WITH SOME PRIVATE HOMEMADE PUPPETS. HERE WAS ONE ODDITY. ANOTHERWAS THAT IN HOUSES WHERE HE GOT FRIENDLY HE WAS GIVEN TO STRETCHHIMSELF AT FULL LENGTH ON THE RUG WHILE HE TALKED AND WAS APT TO BEDISCOVERED IN THIS ATTITUDE BY OCCASIONAL CALLERS FOR WHOM SUCH ANIRREGULARITY WAS LIKELY TO CONFIRM THE NOTIONS OF HIS DANGEROUSLY MIXEDBLOOD AND GENERAL LAXITY.BUT WILLS ARTICLES AND SPEECHES NATURALLY RECOMMENDED HIM IN FAMILIESWHICH THE NEW STRICTNESS OF PARTY DIVISION HAD MARKED OFF ON THE SIDEOF REFORM. HE WAS INVITED TO MR. BULSTRODES BUT HERE HE COULD NOT LIEDOWN ON THE RUG AND MRS. BULSTRODE FELT THAT HIS MODE OF TALKING ABOUTCATHOLIC COUNTRIES AS IF THERE WERE ANY TRUCE WITH ANTICHRISTILLUSTRATED THE USUAL TENDENCY TO UNSOUNDNESS IN INTELLECTUAL MEN.AT MR. FAREBROTHERS HOWEVER WHOM THE IRONY OF EVENTS HAD BROUGHT ONTHE SAME SIDE WITH BULSTRODE IN THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT WILL BECAME AFAVORITE WITH THE LADIES ESPECIALLY WITH LITTLE MISS NOBLE WHOM ITWAS ONE OF HIS ODDITIES TO ESCORT WHEN HE MET HER IN THE STREET WITHHER LITTLE BASKET GIVING HER HIS ARM IN THE EYES OF THE TOWN ANDINSISTING ON GOING WITH HER TO PAY SOME CALL WHERE SHE DISTRIBUTED HERSMALL FILCHINGS FROM HER OWN SHARE OF SWEET THINGS.BUT THE HOUSE WHERE HE VISITED OFTENEST AND LAY MOST ON THE RUG WASLYDGATES. THE TWO MEN WERE NOT AT ALL ALIKE BUT THEY AGREED NONE THEWORSE. LYDGATE WAS ABRUPT BUT NOT IRRITABLE TAKING LITTLE NOTICE OFMEGRIMS IN HEALTHY PEOPLE AND LADISLAW DID NOT USUALLY THROW AWAY HISSUSCEPTIBILITIES ON THOSE WHO TOOK NO NOTICE OF THEM. WITH ROSAMOND ONTHE OTHER HAND HE POUTED AND WAS WAYWARDNAY OFTEN UNCOMPLIMENTARYMUCH TO HER INWARD SURPRISE NEVERTHELESS HE WAS GRADUALLY BECOMINGNECESSARY TO HER ENTERTAINMENT BY HIS COMPANIONSHIP IN HER MUSIC HISVARIED TALK AND HIS FREEDOM FROM THE GRAVE PREOCCUPATION WHICH WITHALL HER HUSBANDS TENDERNESS AND INDULGENCE OFTEN MADE HIS MANNERSUNSATISFACTORY TO HER AND CONFIRMED HER DISLIKE OF THE MEDICALPROFESSION.LYDGATE INCLINED TO BE SARCASTIC ON THE SUPERSTITIOUS FAITH OF THEPEOPLE IN THE EFFICACY OF THE BILL WHILE NOBODY CARED ABOUT THE LOWSTATE OF PATHOLOGY SOMETIMES ASSAILED WILL WITH TROUBLESOME QUESTIONS.ONE EVENING IN MARCH ROSAMOND IN HER CHERRYCOLORED DRESS WITHSWANSDOWN TRIMMING ABOUT THE THROAT SAT AT THE TEATABLE LYDGATELATELY COME IN TIRED FROM HIS OUTDOOR WORK WAS SEATED SIDEWAYS ON ANEASYCHAIR BY THE FIRE WITH ONE LEG OVER THE ELBOW HIS BROW LOOKING ALITTLE TROUBLED AS HIS EYES RAMBLED OVER THE COLUMNS OF THE PIONEERWHILE ROSAMOND HAVING NOTICED THAT HE WAS PERTURBED AVOIDED LOOKINGAT HIM AND INWARDLY THANKED HEAVEN THAT SHE HERSELF HAD NOT A MOODYDISPOSITION. WILL LADISLAW WAS STRETCHED ON THE RUG CONTEMPLATING THECURTAINPOLE ABSTRACTEDLY AND HUMMING VERY LOW THE NOTES OF WHENFIRST I SAW THY FACE WHILE THE HOUSE SPANIEL ALSO STRETCHED OUT WITHSMALL CHOICE OF ROOM LOOKED FROM BETWEEN HIS PAWS AT THE USURPER OFTHE RUG WITH SILENT BUT STRONG OBJECTION.ROSAMOND BRINGING LYDGATE HIS CUP OF TEA HE THREW DOWN THE PAPER ANDSAID TO WILL WHO HAD STARTED UP AND GONE TO THE TABLEITS NO USE YOUR PUFFING BROOKE AS A REFORMING LANDLORD LADISLAWTHEY ONLY PICK THE MORE HOLES IN HIS COAT IN THE TRUMPET.NO MATTER THOSE WHO READ THE PIONEER DONT READ THE TRUMPETSAID WILL SWALLOWING HIS TEA AND WALKING ABOUT. DO YOU SUPPOSE THEPUBLIC READS WITH A VIEW TO ITS OWN CONVERSION WE SHOULD HAVE AWITCHES BREWING WITH A VENGEANCE THENMINGLE MINGLE MINGLE MINGLEYOU THAT MINGLE MAYAND NOBODY WOULD KNOW WHICH SIDE HE WAS GOING TOTAKE.FAREBROTHER SAYS HE DOESNT BELIEVE BROOKE WOULD GET ELECTED IF THEOPPORTUNITY CAME THE VERY MEN WHO PROFESS TO BE FOR HIM WOULD BRINGANOTHER MEMBER OUT OF THE BAG AT THE RIGHT MOMENT.THERES NO HARM IN TRYING. ITS GOOD TO HAVE RESIDENT MEMBERS.WHY SAID LYDGATE WHO WAS MUCH GIVEN TO USE THAT INCONVENIENT WORDIN A CURT TONE.THEY REPRESENT THE LOCAL STUPIDITY BETTER SAID WILL LAUGHING ANDSHAKING HIS CURLS AND THEY ARE KEPT ON THEIR BEST BEHAVIOR IN THENEIGHBORHOOD. BROOKE IS NOT A BAD FELLOW BUT HE HAS DONE SOME GOODTHINGS ON HIS ESTATE THAT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE BUT FOR THISPARLIAMENTARY BITE.HES NOT FITTED TO BE A PUBLIC MAN SAID LYDGATE WITH CONTEMPTUOUSDECISION. HE WOULD DISAPPOINT EVERYBODY WHO COUNTED ON HIM I CAN SEETHAT AT THE HOSPITAL. ONLY THERE BULSTRODE HOLDS THE REINS AND DRIVESHIM.THAT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU FIX YOUR STANDARD OF PUBLIC MEN SAID WILL.HES GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE OCCASION WHEN THE PEOPLE HAVE MADE UP THEIRMIND AS THEY ARE MAKING IT UP NOW THEY DONT WANT A MANTHEY ONLY WANTA VOTE.THAT IS THE WAY WITH YOU POLITICAL WRITERS LADISLAWCRYING UP AMEASURE AS IF IT WERE A UNIVERSAL CURE AND CRYING UP MEN WHO ARE APART OF THE VERY DISEASE THAT WANTS CURING.WHY NOT MEN MAY HELP TO CURE THEMSELVES OFF THE FACE OF THE LANDWITHOUT KNOWING IT SAID WILL WHO COULD FIND REASONS IMPROMPTU WHENHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF A QUESTION BEFOREHAND.THAT IS NO EXCUSE FOR ENCOURAGING THE SUPERSTITIOUS EXAGGERATION OFHOPES ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE HELPING THE CRY TO SWALLOW ITWHOLE AND TO SEND UP VOTING POPINJAYS WHO ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING BUT TOCARRY IT. YOU GO AGAINST ROTTENNESS AND THERE IS NOTHING MORETHOROUGHLY ROTTEN THAN MAKING PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT SOCIETY CAN BE CUREDBY A POLITICAL HOCUSPOCUS.THATS VERY FINE MY DEAR FELLOW. BUT YOUR CURE MUST BEGIN SOMEWHEREAND PUT IT THAT A THOUSAND THINGS WHICH DEBASE A POPULATION CAN NEVERBE REFORMED WITHOUT THIS PARTICULAR REFORM TO BEGIN WITH. LOOK WHATSTANLEY SAID THE OTHER DAYTHAT THE HOUSE HAD BEEN TINKERING LONGENOUGH AT SMALL QUESTIONS OF BRIBERY INQUIRING WHETHER THIS OR THATVOTER HAS HAD A GUINEA WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE SEATS HAVE BEENSOLD WHOLESALE. WAIT FOR WISDOM AND CONSCIENCE IN PUBLICAGENTSFIDDLESTICK THE ONLY CONSCIENCE WE CAN TRUST TO IS THE MASSIVESENSE OF WRONG IN A CLASS AND THE BEST WISDOM THAT WILL WORK IS THEWISDOM OF BALANCING CLAIMS. THATS MY TEXTWHICH SIDE IS INJURED ISUPPORT THE MAN WHO SUPPORTS THEIR CLAIMS NOT THE VIRTUOUS UPHOLDER OFTHE WRONG.THAT GENERAL TALK ABOUT A PARTICULAR CASE IS MERE QUESTION BEGGINGLADISLAW. WHEN I SAY I GO IN FOR THE DOSE THAT CURES IT DOESNTFOLLOW THAT I GO IN FOR OPIUM IN A GIVEN CASE OF GOUT.I AM NOT BEGGING THE QUESTION WE ARE UPONWHETHER WE ARE TO TRY FORNOTHING TILL WE FIND IMMACULATE MEN TO WORK WITH. SHOULD YOU GO ON THATPLAN IF THERE WERE ONE MAN WHO WOULD CARRY YOU A MEDICAL REFORM ANDANOTHER WHO WOULD OPPOSE IT SHOULD YOU INQUIRE WHICH HAD THE BETTERMOTIVES OR EVEN THE BETTER BRAINSOH OF COURSE SAID LYDGATE SEEING HIMSELF CHECKMATED BY A MOVEWHICH HE HAD OFTEN USED HIMSELF IF ONE DID NOT WORK WITH SUCH MEN ASARE AT HAND THINGS MUST COME TO A DEADLOCK. SUPPOSE THE WORST OPINIONIN THE TOWN ABOUT BULSTRODE WERE A TRUE ONE THAT WOULD NOT MAKE ITLESS TRUE THAT HE HAS THE SENSE AND THE RESOLUTION TO DO WHAT I THINKOUGHT TO BE DONE IN THE MATTERS I KNOW AND CARE MOST ABOUT BUT THAT ISTHE ONLY GROUND ON WHICH I GO WITH HIM LYDGATE ADDED RATHER PROUDLYBEARING IN MIND MR. FAREBROTHERS REMARKS. HE IS NOTHING TO MEOTHERWISE I WOULD NOT CRY HIM UP ON ANY PERSONAL GROUNDI WOULD KEEPCLEAR OF THAT.DO YOU MEAN THAT I CRY UP BROOKE ON ANY PERSONAL GROUND SAID WILLLADISLAW NETTLED AND TURNING SHARP ROUND. FOR THE FIRST TIME HE FELTOFFENDED WITH LYDGATE NOT THE LESS SO PERHAPS BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVEDECLINED ANY CLOSE INQUIRY INTO THE GROWTH OF HIS RELATION TO MR.BROOKE.NOT AT ALL SAID LYDGATE I WAS SIMPLY EXPLAINING MY OWN ACTION. IMEANT THAT A MAN MAY WORK FOR A SPECIAL END WITH OTHERS WHOSE MOTIVESAND GENERAL COURSE ARE EQUIVOCAL IF HE IS QUITE SURE OF HIS PERSONALINDEPENDENCE AND THAT HE IS NOT WORKING FOR HIS PRIVATEINTERESTEITHER PLACE OR MONEY.THEN WHY DONT YOU EXTEND YOUR LIBERALITY TO OTHERS SAID WILLSTILL NETTLED. MY PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE IS AS IMPORTANT TO ME AS YOURSIS TO YOU. YOU HAVE NO MORE REASON TO IMAGINE THAT I HAVE PERSONALEXPECTATIONS FROM BROOKE THAN I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE PERSONALEXPECTATIONS FROM BULSTRODE. MOTIVES ARE POINTS OF HONOR ISUPPOSENOBODY CAN PROVE THEM. BUT AS TO MONEY AND PLACE IN THE WORLDWILL ENDED TOSSING BACK HIS HEAD I THINK IT IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT IAM NOT DETERMINED BY CONSIDERATIONS OF THAT SORT.YOU QUITE MISTAKE ME LADISLAW SAID LYDGATE SURPRISED. HE HAD BEENPREOCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN VINDICATION AND HAD BEEN BLIND TO WHATLADISLAW MIGHT INFER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT. I BEG YOUR PARDON FORUNINTENTIONALLY ANNOYING YOU. IN FACT I SHOULD RATHER ATTRIBUTE TO YOUA ROMANTIC DISREGARD OF YOUR OWN WORLDLY INTERESTS. ON THE POLITICALQUESTION I REFERRED SIMPLY TO INTELLECTUAL BIAS.HOW VERY UNPLEASANT YOU BOTH ARE THIS EVENING SAID ROSAMOND. ICANNOT CONCEIVE WHY MONEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO. POLITICS ANDMEDICINE ARE SUFFICIENTLY DISAGREEABLE TO QUARREL UPON. YOU CAN BOTH OFYOU GO ON QUARRELLING WITH ALL THE WORLD AND WITH EACH OTHER ON THOSETWO TOPICS.ROSAMOND LOOKED MILDLY NEUTRAL AS SHE SAID THIS RISING TO RING THEBELL AND THEN CROSSING TO HER WORKTABLE.POOR ROSY SAID LYDGATE PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO HER AS SHE WASPASSING HIM. DISPUTATION IS NOT AMUSING TO CHERUBS. HAVE SOME MUSIC.ASK LADISLAW TO SING WITH YOU.WHEN WILL WAS GONE ROSAMOND SAID TO HER HUSBAND WHAT PUT YOU OUT OFTEMPER THIS EVENING TERTIUSME IT WAS LADISLAW WHO WAS OUT OF TEMPER. HE IS LIKE A BIT OFTINDER.BUT I MEAN BEFORE THAT. SOMETHING HAD VEXED YOU BEFORE YOU CAME INYOU LOOKED CROSS. AND THAT MADE YOU BEGIN TO DISPUTE WITH MR. LADISLAW.YOU HURT ME VERY MUCH WHEN YOU LOOK SO TERTIUS.DO I THEN I AM A BRUTE SAID LYDGATE CARESSING HER PENITENTLY.WHAT VEXED YOUOH OUTDOOR THINGSBUSINESS. IT WAS REALLY A LETTER INSISTING ON THEPAYMENT OF A BILL FOR FURNITURE. BUT ROSAMOND WAS EXPECTING TO HAVE ABABY AND LYDGATE WISHED TO SAVE HER FROM ANY PERTURBATION.CHAPTER XLVII.WAS NEVER TRUE LOVE LOVED IN VAINFOR TRUEST LOVE IS HIGHEST GAIN.NO ART CAN MAKE IT IT MUST SPRINGWHERE ELEMENTS ARE FOSTERING.SO IN HEAVENS SPOT AND HOURSPRINGS THE LITTLE NATIVE FLOWERDOWNWARD ROOT AND UPWARD EYESHAPEN BY THE EARTH AND SKY.IT HAPPENED TO BE ON A SATURDAY EVENING THAT WILL LADISLAW HAD THATLITTLE DISCUSSION WITH LYDGATE. ITS EFFECT WHEN HE WENT TO HIS OWNROOMS WAS TO MAKE HIM SIT UP HALF THE NIGHT THINKING OVER AGAIN UNDERA NEW IRRITATION ALL THAT HE HAD BEFORE THOUGHT OF HIS HAVING SETTLEDIN MIDDLEMARCH AND HARNESSED HIMSELF WITH MR. BROOKE. HESITATIONSBEFORE HE HAD TAKEN THE STEP HAD SINCE TURNED INTO SUSCEPTIBILITY TOEVERY HINT THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WISER NOT TO TAKE IT AND HENCE CAMEHIS HEAT TOWARDS LYDGATEA HEAT WHICH STILL KEPT HIM RESTLESS. WAS HENOT MAKING A FOOL OF HIMSELFAND AT A TIME WHEN HE WAS MORE THAN EVERCONSCIOUS OF BEING SOMETHING BETTER THAN A FOOL AND FOR WHAT ENDWELL FOR NO DEFINITE END. TRUE HE HAD DREAMY VISIONS OFPOSSIBILITIES THERE IS NO HUMAN BEING WHO HAVING BOTH PASSIONS ANDTHOUGHTS DOES NOT THINK IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS PASSIONSDOES NOT FINDIMAGES RISING IN HIS MIND WHICH SOOTHE THE PASSION WITH HOPE OR STINGIT WITH DREAD. BUT THIS WHICH HAPPENS TO US ALL HAPPENS TO SOME WITHA WIDE DIFFERENCE AND WILL WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE WHOSE WIT KEEPS THEROADWAY HE HAD HIS BYPATHS WHERE THERE WERE LITTLE JOYS OF HIS OWNCHOOSING SUCH AS GENTLEMEN CANTERING ON THE HIGHROAD MIGHT HAVETHOUGHT RATHER IDIOTIC. THE WAY IN WHICH HE MADE A SORT OF HAPPINESSFOR HIMSELF OUT OF HIS FEELING FOR DOROTHEA WAS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS. ITMAY SEEM STRANGE BUT IT IS THE FACT THAT THE ORDINARY VULGAR VISIONOF WHICH MR. CASAUBON SUSPECTED HIMNAMELY THAT DOROTHEA MIGHT BECOMEA WIDOW AND THAT THE INTEREST HE HAD ESTABLISHED IN HER MIND MIGHTTURN INTO ACCEPTANCE OF HIM AS A HUSBANDHAD NO TEMPTING ARRESTINGPOWER OVER HIM HE DID NOT LIVE IN THE SCENERY OF SUCH AN EVENT ANDFOLLOW IT OUT AS WE ALL DO WITH THAT IMAGINED OTHERWISE WHICH IS OURPRACTICAL HEAVEN. IT WAS NOT ONLY THAT HE WAS UNWILLING TO ENTERTAINTHOUGHTS WHICH COULD BE ACCUSED OF BASENESS AND WAS ALREADY UNEASY INTHE SENSE THAT HE HAD TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF FROM THE CHARGE OFINGRATITUDETHE LATENT CONSCIOUSNESS OF MANY OTHER BARRIERS BETWEENHIMSELF AND DOROTHEA BESIDES THE EXISTENCE OF HER HUSBAND HAD HELPEDTO TURN AWAY HIS IMAGINATION FROM SPECULATING ON WHAT MIGHT BEFALL MR.CASAUBON. AND THERE WERE YET OTHER REASONS. WILL WE KNOW COULD NOTBEAR THE THOUGHT OF ANY FLAW APPEARING IN HIS CRYSTAL HE WAS AT ONCEEXASPERATED AND DELIGHTED BY THE CALM FREEDOM WITH WHICH DOROTHEALOOKED AT HIM AND SPOKE TO HIM AND THERE WAS SOMETHING SO EXQUISITE INTHINKING OF HER JUST AS SHE WAS THAT HE COULD NOT LONG FOR A CHANGEWHICH MUST SOMEHOW CHANGE HER. DO WE NOT SHUN THE STREET VERSION OF AFINE MELODYOR SHRINK FROM THE NEWS THAT THE RARITYSOME BIT OFCHISELLING OR ENGRAVING PERHAPSWHICH WE HAVE DWELT ON EVEN WITHEXULTATION IN THE TROUBLE IT HAS COST US TO SNATCH GLIMPSES OF IT ISREALLY NOT AN UNCOMMON THING AND MAY BE OBTAINED AS AN EVERYDAYPOSSESSION OUR GOOD DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY AND BREADTH OF OUR EMOTIONAND TO WILL A CREATURE WHO CARED LITTLE FOR WHAT ARE CALLED THE SOLIDTHINGS OF LIFE AND GREATLY FOR ITS SUBTLER INFLUENCES TO HAVE WITHINHIM SUCH A FEELING AS HE HAD TOWARDS DOROTHEA WAS LIKE THE INHERITANCEOF A FORTUNE. WHAT OTHERS MIGHT HAVE CALLED THE FUTILITY OF HISPASSION MADE AN ADDITIONAL DELIGHT FOR HIS IMAGINATION HE WASCONSCIOUS OF A GENEROUS MOVEMENT AND OF VERIFYING IN HIS OWNEXPERIENCE THAT HIGHER LOVEPOETRY WHICH HAD CHARMED HIS FANCY.DOROTHEA HE SAID TO HIMSELF WAS FOREVER ENTHRONED IN HIS SOUL NOOTHER WOMAN COULD SIT HIGHER THAN HER FOOTSTOOL AND IF HE COULD HAVEWRITTEN OUT IN IMMORTAL SYLLABLES THE EFFECT SHE WROUGHT WITHIN HIM HEMIGHT HAVE BOASTED AFTER THE EXAMPLE OF OLD DRAYTON THATQUEENS HEREAFTER MIGHT BE GLAD TO LIVEUPON THE ALMS OF HER SUPERFLUOUS PRAISE.BUT THIS RESULT WAS QUESTIONABLE. AND WHAT ELSE COULD HE DO FORDOROTHEA WHAT WAS HIS DEVOTION WORTH TO HER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TOTELL. HE WOULD NOT GO OUT OF HER REACH. HE SAW NO CREATURE AMONG HERFRIENDS TO WHOM HE COULD BELIEVE THAT SHE SPOKE WITH THE SAME SIMPLECONFIDENCE AS TO HIM. SHE HAD ONCE SAID THAT SHE WOULD LIKE HIM TOSTAY AND STAY HE WOULD WHATEVER FIREBREATHING DRAGONS MIGHT HISSAROUND HER.THIS HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE CONCLUSION OF WILLS HESITATIONS. BUT HE WASNOT WITHOUT CONTRADICTORINESS AND REBELLION EVEN TOWARDS HIS OWNRESOLVE. HE HAD OFTEN GOT IRRITATED AS HE WAS ON THIS PARTICULARNIGHT BY SOME OUTSIDE DEMONSTRATION THAT HIS PUBLIC EXERTIONS WITH MR.BROOKE AS A CHIEF COULD NOT SEEM AS HEROIC AS HE WOULD LIKE THEM TO BEAND THIS WAS ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OTHER GROUND OF IRRITATIONTHATNOTWITHSTANDING HIS SACRIFICE OF DIGNITY FOR DOROTHEAS SAKE HE COULDHARDLY EVER SEE HER. WHEREUPON NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTRADICT THESEUNPLEASANT FACTS HE CONTRADICTED HIS OWN STRONGEST BIAS AND SAID IAM A FOOL.NEVERTHELESS SINCE THE INWARD DEBATE NECESSARILY TURNED ON DOROTHEAHE ENDED AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE ONLY BY GETTING A LIVELIER SENSE OFWHAT HER PRESENCE WOULD BE TO HIM AND SUDDENLY REFLECTING THAT THEMORROW WOULD BE SUNDAY HE DETERMINED TO GO TO LOWICK CHURCH AND SEEHER. HE SLEPT UPON THAT IDEA BUT WHEN HE WAS DRESSING IN THE RATIONALMORNING LIGHT OBJECTION SAIDTHAT WILL BE A VIRTUAL DEFIANCE OF MR. CASAUBONS PROHIBITION TO VISITLOWICK AND DOROTHEA WILL BE DISPLEASED.NONSENSE ARGUED INCLINATION IT WOULD BE TOO MONSTROUS FOR HIM TOHINDER ME FROM GOING OUT TO A PRETTY COUNTRY CHURCH ON A SPRINGMORNING. AND DOROTHEA WILL BE GLAD.IT WILL BE CLEAR TO MR. CASAUBON THAT YOU HAVE COME EITHER TO ANNOYHIM OR TO SEE DOROTHEA.IT IS NOT TRUE THAT I GO TO ANNOY HIM AND WHY SHOULD I NOT GO TO SEEDOROTHEA IS HE TO HAVE EVERYTHING TO HIMSELF AND BE ALWAYSCOMFORTABLE LET HIM SMART A LITTLE AS OTHER PEOPLE ARE OBLIGED TO DO.I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED THE QUAINTNESS OF THE CHURCH AND CONGREGATIONBESIDES I KNOW THE TUCKERS I SHALL GO INTO THEIR PEW.HAVING SILENCED OBJECTION BY FORCE OF UNREASON WILL WALKED TO LOWICKAS IF HE HAD BEEN ON THE WAY TO PARADISE CROSSING HALSELL COMMON ANDSKIRTING THE WOOD WHERE THE SUNLIGHT FELL BROADLY UNDER THE BUDDINGBOUGHS BRINGING OUT THE BEAUTIES OF MOSS AND LICHEN AND FRESH GREENGROWTHS PIERCING THE BROWN. EVERYTHING SEEMED TO KNOW THAT IT WASSUNDAY AND TO APPROVE OF HIS GOING TO LOWICK CHURCH. WILL EASILY FELTHAPPY WHEN NOTHING CROSSED HIS HUMOR AND BY THIS TIME THE THOUGHT OFVEXING MR. CASAUBON HAD BECOME RATHER AMUSING TO HIM MAKING HIS FACEBREAK INTO ITS MERRY SMILE PLEASANT TO SEE AS THE BREAKING OF SUNSHINEON THE WATERTHOUGH THE OCCASION WAS NOT EXEMPLARY. BUT MOST OF US AREAPT TO SETTLE WITHIN OURSELVES THAT THE MAN WHO BLOCKS OUR WAY ISODIOUS AND NOT TO MIND CAUSING HIM A LITTLE OF THE DISGUST WHICH HISPERSONALITY EXCITES IN OURSELVES. WILL WENT ALONG WITH A SMALL BOOKUNDER HIS ARM AND A HAND IN EACH SIDEPOCKET NEVER READING BUTCHANTING A LITTLE AS HE MADE SCENES OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN CHURCH ANDCOMING OUT. HE WAS EXPERIMENTING IN TUNES TO SUIT SOME WORDS OF HISOWN SOMETIMES TRYING A READYMADE MELODY SOMETIMES IMPROVISING. THEWORDS WERE NOT EXACTLY A HYMN BUT THEY CERTAINLY FITTED HIS SUNDAYEXPERIENCEO ME O ME WHAT FRUGAL CHEER    MY LOVE DOTH FEED UPONA TOUCH A RAY THAT IS NOT HERE    A SHADOW THAT IS GONEA DREAM OF BREATH THAT MIGHT BE NEAR    AN INLYECHOED TONETHE THOUGHT THAT ONE MAY THINK ME DEAR    THE PLACE WHERE ONE WAS KNOWNTHE TREMOR OF A BANISHED FEAR     AN ILL THAT WAS NOT DONEO ME O ME WHAT FRUGAL CHEER    MY LOVE DOTH FEED UPONSOMETIMES WHEN HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT SHAKING HIS HEAD BACKWARD ANDSHOWING HIS DELICATE THROAT AS HE SANG HE LOOKED LIKE AN INCARNATIONOF THE SPRING WHOSE SPIRIT FILLED THE AIRA BRIGHT CREATURE ABUNDANTIN UNCERTAIN PROMISES.THE BELLS WERE STILL RINGING WHEN HE GOT TO LOWICK AND HE WENT INTOTHE CURATES PEW BEFORE ANY ONE ELSE ARRIVED THERE. BUT HE WAS STILLLEFT ALONE IN IT WHEN THE CONGREGATION HAD ASSEMBLED. THE CURATES PEWWAS OPPOSITE THE RECTORS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE SMALL CHANCEL ANDWILL HAD TIME TO FEAR THAT DOROTHEA MIGHT NOT COME WHILE HE LOOKEDROUND AT THE GROUP OF RURAL FACES WHICH MADE THE CONGREGATION FROM YEARTO YEAR WITHIN THE WHITEWASHED WALLS AND DARK OLD PEWS HARDLY WITHMORE CHANGE THAN WE SEE IN THE BOUGHS OF A TREE WHICH BREAKS HERE ANDTHERE WITH AGE BUT YET HAS YOUNG SHOOTS. MR. RIGGS FROGFACE WASSOMETHING ALIEN AND UNACCOUNTABLE BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS SHOCK TOTHE ORDER OF THINGS THERE WERE STILL THE WAULES AND THE RURAL STOCK OFTHE POWDERELLS IN THEIR PEWS SIDE BY SIDE BROTHER SAMUELS CHEEK HADTHE SAME PURPLE ROUND AS EVER AND THE THREE GENERATIONS OF DECENTCOTTAGERS CAME AS OF OLD WITH A SENSE OF DUTY TO THEIR BETTERSGENERALLYTHE SMALLER CHILDREN REGARDING MR. CASAUBON WHO WORE THEBLACK GOWN AND MOUNTED TO THE HIGHEST BOX AS PROBABLY THE CHIEF OF ALLBETTERS AND THE ONE MOST AWFUL IF OFFENDED. EVEN IN  LOWICK WAS ATPEACE NOT MORE AGITATED BY REFORM THAN BY THE SOLEMN TENOR OF THESUNDAY SERMON. THE CONGREGATION HAD BEEN USED TO SEEING WILL AT CHURCHIN FORMER DAYS AND NO ONE TOOK MUCH NOTE OF HIM EXCEPT THE CHOIR WHOEXPECTED HIM TO MAKE A FIGURE IN THE SINGING.DOROTHEA DID AT LAST APPEAR ON THIS QUAINT BACKGROUND WALKING UP THESHORT AISLE IN HER WHITE BEAVER BONNET AND GRAY CLOAKTHE SAME SHE HADWORN IN THE VATICAN. HER FACE BEING FROM HER ENTRANCE TOWARDS THECHANCEL EVEN HER SHORTSIGHTED EYES SOON DISCERNED WILL BUT THERE WASNO OUTWARD SHOW OF HER FEELING EXCEPT A SLIGHT PALENESS AND A GRAVE BOWAS SHE PASSED HIM. TO HIS OWN SURPRISE WILL FELT SUDDENLYUNCOMFORTABLE AND DARED NOT LOOK AT HER AFTER THEY HAD BOWED TO EACHOTHER. TWO MINUTES LATER WHEN MR. CASAUBON CAME OUT OF THE VESTRYAND ENTERING THE PEW SEATED HIMSELF IN FACE OF DOROTHEA WILL FELTHIS PARALYSIS MORE COMPLETE. HE COULD LOOK NOWHERE EXCEPT AT THE CHOIRIN THE LITTLE GALLERY OVER THE VESTRYDOOR DOROTHEA WAS PERHAPSPAINED AND HE HAD MADE A WRETCHED BLUNDER. IT WAS NO LONGER AMUSING TOVEX MR. CASAUBON WHO HAD THE ADVANTAGE PROBABLY OF WATCHING HIM ANDSEEING THAT HE DARED NOT TURN HIS HEAD. WHY HAD HE NOT IMAGINED THISBEFOREHANDBUT HE COULD NOT EXPECT THAT HE SHOULD SIT IN THAT SQUAREPEW ALONE UNRELIEVED BY ANY TUCKERS WHO HAD APPARENTLY DEPARTED FROMLOWICK ALTOGETHER FOR A NEW CLERGYMAN WAS IN THE DESK. STILL HE CALLEDHIMSELF STUPID NOW FOR NOT FORESEEING THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FORHIM TO LOOK TOWARDS DOROTHEANAY THAT SHE MIGHT FEEL HIS COMING ANIMPERTINENCE. THERE WAS NO DELIVERING HIMSELF FROM HIS CAGE HOWEVERAND WILL FOUND HIS PLACES AND LOOKED AT HIS BOOK AS IF HE HAD BEEN ASCHOOLMISTRESS FEELING THAT THE MORNING SERVICE HAD NEVER BEEN SOIMMEASURABLY LONG BEFORE THAT HE WAS UTTERLY RIDICULOUS OUT OFTEMPER AND MISERABLE. THIS WAS WHAT A MAN GOT BY WORSHIPPING THE SIGHTOF A WOMAN THE CLERK OBSERVED WITH SURPRISE THAT MR. LADISLAW DID NOTJOIN IN THE TUNE OF HANOVER AND REFLECTED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A COLD.MR. CASAUBON DID NOT PREACH THAT MORNING AND THERE WAS NO CHANGE INWILLS SITUATION UNTIL THE BLESSING HAD BEEN PRONOUNCED AND EVERY ONEROSE. IT WAS THE FASHION AT LOWICK FOR THE BETTERS TO GO OUT FIRST.WITH A SUDDEN DETERMINATION TO BREAK THE SPELL THAT WAS UPON HIM WILLLOOKED STRAIGHT AT MR. CASAUBON. BUT THAT GENTLEMANS EYES WERE ON THEBUTTON OF THE PEWDOOR WHICH HE OPENED ALLOWING DOROTHEA TO PASS ANDFOLLOWING HER IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT RAISING HIS EYELIDS. WILLS GLANCEHAD CAUGHT DOROTHEAS AS SHE TURNED OUT OF THE PEW AND AGAIN SHEBOWED BUT THIS TIME WITH A LOOK OF AGITATION AS IF SHE WEREREPRESSING TEARS. WILL WALKED OUT AFTER THEM BUT THEY WENT ON TOWARDSTHE LITTLE GATE LEADING OUT OF THE CHURCHYARD INTO THE SHRUBBERY NEVERLOOKING ROUND.IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO FOLLOW THEM AND HE COULD ONLY WALK BACKSADLY AT MIDDAY ALONG THE SAME ROAD WHICH HE HAD TRODDEN HOPEFULLY INTHE MORNING. THE LIGHTS WERE ALL CHANGED FOR HIM BOTH WITHOUT ANDWITHIN.CHAPTER XLVIII.SURELY THE GOLDEN HOURS ARE TURNING GRAYAND DANCE NO MORE AND VAINLY STRIVE TO RUNI SEE THEIR WHITE LOCKS STREAMING IN THE WINDEACH FACE IS HAGGARD AS IT LOOKS AT MESLOW TURNING IN THE CONSTANT CLASPING ROUNDSTORMDRIVEN.DOROTHEAS DISTRESS WHEN SHE WAS LEAVING THE CHURCH CAME CHIEFLY FROMTHE PERCEPTION THAT MR. CASAUBON WAS DETERMINED NOT TO SPEAK TO HISCOUSIN AND THAT WILLS PRESENCE AT CHURCH HAD SERVED TO MARK MORESTRONGLY THE ALIENATION BETWEEN THEM. WILLS COMING SEEMED TO HER QUITEEXCUSABLE NAY SHE THOUGHT IT AN AMIABLE MOVEMENT IN HIM TOWARDS ARECONCILIATION WHICH SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY WISHING FOR. HEHAD PROBABLY IMAGINED AS SHE HAD THAT IF MR. CASAUBON AND HE COULDMEET EASILY THEY WOULD SHAKE HANDS AND FRIENDLY INTERCOURSE MIGHTRETURN. BUT NOW DOROTHEA FELT QUITE ROBBED OF THAT HOPE. WILL WASBANISHED FURTHER THAN EVER FOR MR. CASAUBON MUST HAVE BEEN NEWLYEMBITTERED BY THIS THRUSTING UPON HIM OF A PRESENCE WHICH HE REFUSED TORECOGNIZE.HE HAD NOT BEEN VERY WELL THAT MORNING SUFFERING FROM SOME DIFFICULTYIN BREATHING AND HAD NOT PREACHED IN CONSEQUENCE SHE WAS NOTSURPRISED THEREFORE THAT HE WAS NEARLY SILENT AT LUNCHEON STILL LESSTHAT HE MADE NO ALLUSION TO WILL LADISLAW. FOR HER OWN PART SHE FELTTHAT SHE COULD NEVER AGAIN INTRODUCE THAT SUBJECT. THEY USUALLY SPENTAPART THE HOURS BETWEEN LUNCHEON AND DINNER ON A SUNDAY MR. CASAUBONIN THE LIBRARY DOZING CHIEFLY AND DOROTHEA IN HER BOUDOIR WHERE SHEWAS WONT TO OCCUPY HERSELF WITH SOME OF HER FAVORITE BOOKS. THERE WAS ALITTLE HEAP OF THEM ON THE TABLE IN THE BOWWINDOWOF VARIOUS SORTSFROM HERODOTUS WHICH SHE WAS LEARNING TO READ WITH MR. CASAUBON TOHER OLD COMPANION PASCAL AND KEBLES CHRISTIAN YEAR. BUT TODAY SHEOPENED ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND COULD READ NONE OF THEM. EVERYTHINGSEEMED DREARY THE PORTENTS BEFORE THE BIRTH OF CYRUSJEWISHANTIQUITIESOH DEARDEVOUT EPIGRAMSTHE SACRED CHIME OF FAVORITEHYMNSALL ALIKE WERE AS FLAT AS TUNES BEATEN ON WOOD EVEN THE SPRINGFLOWERS AND THE GRASS HAD A DULL SHIVER IN THEM UNDER THE AFTERNOONCLOUDS THAT HID THE SUN FITFULLY EVEN THE SUSTAINING THOUGHTS WHICHHAD BECOME HABITS SEEMED TO HAVE IN THEM THE WEARINESS OF LONG FUTUREDAYS IN WHICH SHE WOULD STILL LIVE WITH THEM FOR HER SOLE COMPANIONS.IT WAS ANOTHER OR RATHER A FULLER SORT OF COMPANIONSHIP THAT POORDOROTHEA WAS HUNGERING FOR AND THE HUNGER HAD GROWN FROM THE PERPETUALEFFORT DEMANDED BY HER MARRIED LIFE. SHE WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO BE WHATHER HUSBAND WISHED AND NEVER ABLE TO REPOSE ON HIS DELIGHT IN WHAT SHEWAS. THE THING THAT SHE LIKED THAT SHE SPONTANEOUSLY CARED TO HAVESEEMED TO BE ALWAYS EXCLUDED FROM HER LIFE FOR IF IT WAS ONLY GRANTEDAND NOT SHARED BY HER HUSBAND IT MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN DENIED. ABOUTWILL LADISLAW THERE HAD BEEN A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM FROM THE FIRSTAND IT HAD ENDED SINCE MR. CASAUBON HAD SO SEVERELY REPULSEDDOROTHEAS STRONG FEELING ABOUT HIS CLAIMS ON THE FAMILY PROPERTY BYHER BEING CONVINCED THAT SHE WAS IN THE RIGHT AND HER HUSBAND IN THEWRONG BUT THAT SHE WAS HELPLESS. THIS AFTERNOON THE HELPLESSNESS WASMORE WRETCHEDLY BENUMBING THAN EVER SHE LONGED FOR OBJECTS WHO COULDBE DEAR TO HER AND TO WHOM SHE COULD BE DEAR. SHE LONGED FOR WORKWHICH WOULD BE DIRECTLY BENEFICENT LIKE THE SUNSHINE AND THE RAIN ANDNOW IT APPEARED THAT SHE WAS TO LIVE MORE AND MORE IN A VIRTUAL TOMBWHERE THERE WAS THE APPARATUS OF A GHASTLY LABOR PRODUCING WHAT WOULDNEVER SEE THE LIGHT. TODAY SHE HAD STOOD AT THE DOOR OF THE TOMB ANDSEEN WILL LADISLAW RECEDING INTO THE DISTANT WORLD OF WARM ACTIVITY ANDFELLOWSHIPTURNING HIS FACE TOWARDS HER AS HE WENT.BOOKS WERE OF NO USE. THINKING WAS OF NO USE. IT WAS SUNDAY AND SHECOULD NOT HAVE THE CARRIAGE TO GO TO CELIA WHO HAD LATELY HAD A BABY.THERE WAS NO REFUGE NOW FROM SPIRITUAL EMPTINESS AND DISCONTENT ANDDOROTHEA HAD TO BEAR HER BAD MOOD AS SHE WOULD HAVE BORNE A HEADACHE.AFTER DINNER AT THE HOUR WHEN SHE USUALLY BEGAN TO READ ALOUD MR.CASAUBON PROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULD GO INTO THE LIBRARY WHERE HE SAIDHE HAD ORDERED A FIRE AND LIGHTS. HE SEEMED TO HAVE REVIVED AND TO BETHINKING INTENTLY.IN THE LIBRARY DOROTHEA OBSERVED THAT HE HAD NEWLY ARRANGED A ROW OFHIS NOTEBOOKS ON A TABLE AND NOW HE TOOK UP AND PUT INTO HER HAND AWELLKNOWN VOLUME WHICH WAS A TABLE OF CONTENTS TO ALL THE OTHERS.YOU WILL OBLIGE ME MY DEAR HE SAID SEATING HIMSELF IF INSTEAD OFOTHER READING THIS EVENING YOU WILL GO THROUGH THIS ALOUD PENCIL INHAND AND AT EACH POINT WHERE I SAY MARK WILL MAKE A CROSS WITH YOURPENCIL. THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN A SIFTING PROCESS WHICH I HAVE LONGHAD IN VIEW AND AS WE GO ON I SHALL BE ABLE TO INDICATE TO YOU CERTAINPRINCIPLES OF SELECTION WHEREBY YOU WILL I TRUST HAVE AN INTELLIGENTPARTICIPATION IN MY PURPOSE.THIS PROPOSAL WAS ONLY ONE MORE SIGN ADDED TO MANY SINCE HIS MEMORABLEINTERVIEW WITH LYDGATE THAT MR. CASAUBONS ORIGINAL RELUCTANCE TO LETDOROTHEA WORK WITH HIM HAD GIVEN PLACE TO THE CONTRARY DISPOSITIONNAMELY TO DEMAND MUCH INTEREST AND LABOR FROM HER.AFTER SHE HAD READ AND MARKED FOR TWO HOURS HE SAID WE WILL TAKE THEVOLUME UPSTAIRSAND THE PENCIL IF YOU PLEASEAND IN CASE OF READINGIN THE NIGHT WE CAN PURSUE THIS TASK. IT IS NOT WEARISOME TO YOU ITRUST DOROTHEAI PREFER ALWAYS READING WHAT YOU LIKE BEST TO HEAR SAID DOROTHEAWHO TOLD THE SIMPLE TRUTH FOR WHAT SHE DREADED WAS TO EXERT HERSELF INREADING OR ANYTHING ELSE WHICH LEFT HIM AS JOYLESS AS EVER.IT WAS A PROOF OF THE FORCE WITH WHICH CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS INDOROTHEA IMPRESSED THOSE AROUND HER THAT HER HUSBAND WITH ALL HISJEALOUSY AND SUSPICION HAD GATHERED IMPLICIT TRUST IN THE INTEGRITY OFHER PROMISES AND HER POWER OF DEVOTING HERSELF TO HER IDEA OF THERIGHT AND BEST. OF LATE HE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL THAT THESE QUALITIES WEREA PECULIAR POSSESSION FOR HIMSELF AND HE WANTED TO ENGROSS THEM.THE READING IN THE NIGHT DID COME. DOROTHEA IN HER YOUNG WEARINESS HADSLEPT SOON AND FAST SHE WAS AWAKENED BY A SENSE OF LIGHT WHICH SEEMEDTO HER AT FIRST LIKE A SUDDEN VISION OF SUNSET AFTER SHE HAD CLIMBED ASTEEP HILL SHE OPENED HER EYES AND SAW HER HUSBAND WRAPPED IN HIS WARMGOWN SEATING HIMSELF IN THE ARMCHAIR NEAR THE FIREPLACE WHERE THEEMBERS WERE STILL GLOWING. HE HAD LIT TWO CANDLES EXPECTING THATDOROTHEA WOULD AWAKE BUT NOT LIKING TO ROUSE HER BY MORE DIRECT MEANS.ARE YOU ILL EDWARD SHE SAID RISING IMMEDIATELY.I FELT SOME UNEASINESS IN A RECLINING POSTURE. I WILL SIT HERE FOR ATIME. SHE THREW WOOD ON THE FIRE WRAPPED HERSELF UP AND SAID YOUWOULD LIKE ME TO READ TO YOUYOU WOULD OBLIGE ME GREATLY BY DOING SO DOROTHEA SAID MR. CASAUBONWITH A SHADE MORE MEEKNESS THAN USUAL IN HIS POLITE MANNER. I AMWAKEFUL MY MIND IS REMARKABLY LUCID.I FEAR THAT THE EXCITEMENT MAY BE TOO GREAT FOR YOU SAID DOROTHEAREMEMBERING LYDGATES CAUTIONS.NO I AM NOT CONSCIOUS OF UNDUE EXCITEMENT. THOUGHT IS EASY. DOROTHEADARED NOT INSIST AND SHE READ FOR AN HOUR OR MORE ON THE SAME PLAN ASSHE HAD DONE IN THE EVENING BUT GETTING OVER THE PAGES WITH MOREQUICKNESS. MR. CASAUBONS MIND WAS MORE ALERT AND HE SEEMED TOANTICIPATE WHAT WAS COMING AFTER A VERY SLIGHT VERBAL INDICATIONSAYING THAT WILL DOMARK THATOR PASS ON TO THE NEXT HEADI OMITTHE SECOND EXCURSUS ON CRETE. DOROTHEA WAS AMAZED TO THINK OF THEBIRDLIKE SPEED WITH WHICH HIS MIND WAS SURVEYING THE GROUND WHERE ITHAD BEEN CREEPING FOR YEARS. AT LAST HE SAIDCLOSE THE BOOK NOW MY DEAR. WE WILL RESUME OUR WORK TOMORROW. I HAVEDEFERRED IT TOO LONG AND WOULD GLADLY SEE IT COMPLETED. BUT YOUOBSERVE THAT THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH MY SELECTION IS MADE IS TO GIVEADEQUATE AND NOT DISPROPORTIONATE ILLUSTRATION TO EACH OF THE THESESENUMERATED IN MY INTRODUCTION AS AT PRESENT SKETCHED. YOU HAVEPERCEIVED THAT DISTINCTLY DOROTHEAYES SAID DOROTHEA RATHER TREMULOUSLY. SHE FELT SICK AT HEART.AND NOW I THINK THAT I CAN TAKE SOME REPOSE SAID MR. CASAUBON. HELAID DOWN AGAIN AND BEGGED HER TO PUT OUT THE LIGHTS. WHEN SHE HAD LAINDOWN TOO AND THERE WAS A DARKNESS ONLY BROKEN BY A DULL GLOW ON THEHEARTH HE SAIDBEFORE I SLEEP I HAVE A REQUEST TO MAKE DOROTHEA.WHAT IS IT SAID DOROTHEA WITH DREAD IN HER MIND.IT IS THAT YOU WILL LET ME KNOW DELIBERATELY WHETHER IN CASE OF MYDEATH YOU WILL CARRY OUT MY WISHES WHETHER YOU WILL AVOID DOING WHATI SHOULD DEPRECATE AND APPLY YOURSELF TO DO WHAT I SHOULD DESIRE.DOROTHEA WAS NOT TAKEN BY SURPRISE MANY INCIDENTS HAD BEEN LEADING HERTO THE CONJECTURE OF SOME INTENTION ON HER HUSBANDS PART WHICH MIGHTMAKE A NEW YOKE FOR HER. SHE DID NOT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY.YOU REFUSE SAID MR. CASAUBON WITH MORE EDGE IN HIS TONE.NO I DO NOT YET REFUSE SAID DOROTHEA IN A CLEAR VOICE THE NEED OFFREEDOM ASSERTING ITSELF WITHIN HER BUT IT IS TOO SOLEMNI THINK ITIS NOT RIGHTTO MAKE A PROMISE WHEN I AM IGNORANT WHAT IT WILL BIND METO. WHATEVER AFFECTION PROMPTED I WOULD DO WITHOUT PROMISING.BUT YOU WOULD USE YOUR OWN JUDGMENT I ASK YOU TO OBEY MINE YOUREFUSE.NO DEAR NO SAID DOROTHEA BESEECHINGLY CRUSHED BY OPPOSING FEARS.BUT MAY I WAIT AND REFLECT A LITTLE WHILE I DESIRE WITH MY WHOLE SOULTO DO WHAT WILL COMFORT YOU BUT I CANNOT GIVE ANY PLEDGESUDDENLYSTILL LESS A PLEDGE TO DO I KNOW NOT WHAT.YOU CANNOT THEN CONFIDE IN THE NATURE OF MY WISHESGRANT ME TILL TOMORROW SAID DOROTHEA BESEECHINGLY.TILL TOMORROW THEN SAID MR. CASAUBON.SOON SHE COULD HEAR THAT HE WAS SLEEPING BUT THERE WAS NO MORE SLEEPFOR HER. WHILE SHE CONSTRAINED HERSELF TO LIE STILL LEST SHE SHOULDDISTURB HIM HER MIND WAS CARRYING ON A CONFLICT IN WHICH IMAGINATIONRANGED ITS FORCES FIRST ON ONE SIDE AND THEN ON THE OTHER. SHE HAD NOPRESENTIMENT THAT THE POWER WHICH HER HUSBAND WISHED TO ESTABLISH OVERHER FUTURE ACTION HAD RELATION TO ANYTHING ELSE THAN HIS WORK. BUT ITWAS CLEAR ENOUGH TO HER THAT HE WOULD EXPECT HER TO DEVOTE HERSELF TOSIFTING THOSE MIXED HEAPS OF MATERIAL WHICH WERE TO BE THE DOUBTFULILLUSTRATION OF PRINCIPLES STILL MORE DOUBTFUL. THE POOR CHILD HADBECOME ALTOGETHER UNBELIEVING AS TO THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF THAT KEYWHICH HAD MADE THE AMBITION AND THE LABOR OF HER HUSBANDS LIFE. IT WASNOT WONDERFUL THAT IN SPITE OF HER SMALL INSTRUCTION HER JUDGMENT INTHIS MATTER WAS TRUER THAN HIS FOR SHE LOOKED WITH UNBIASSEDCOMPARISON AND HEALTHY SENSE AT PROBABILITIES ON WHICH HE HAD RISKEDALL HIS EGOISM. AND NOW SHE PICTURED TO HERSELF THE DAYS AND MONTHSAND YEARS WHICH SHE MUST SPEND IN SORTING WHAT MIGHT BE CALLEDSHATTERED MUMMIES AND FRAGMENTS OF A TRADITION WHICH WAS ITSELF AMOSAIC WROUGHT FROM CRUSHED RUINSSORTING THEM AS FOOD FOR A THEORYWHICH WAS ALREADY WITHERED IN THE BIRTH LIKE AN ELFIN CHILD. DOUBTLESSA VIGOROUS ERROR VIGOROUSLY PURSUED HAS KEPT THE EMBRYOS OF TRUTHABREATHING THE QUEST OF GOLD BEING AT THE SAME TIME A QUESTIONING OFSUBSTANCES THE BODY OF CHEMISTRY IS PREPARED FOR ITS SOUL ANDLAVOISIER IS BORN. BUT MR. CASAUBONS THEORY OF THE ELEMENTS WHICH MADETHE SEED OF ALL TRADITION WAS NOT LIKELY TO BRUISE ITSELF UNAWARESAGAINST DISCOVERIES IT FLOATED AMONG FLEXIBLE CONJECTURES NO MORESOLID THAN THOSE ETYMOLOGIES WHICH SEEMED STRONG BECAUSE OF LIKENESS INSOUND UNTIL IT WAS SHOWN THAT LIKENESS IN SOUND MADE THEM IMPOSSIBLEIT WAS A METHOD OF INTERPRETATION WHICH WAS NOT TESTED BY THE NECESSITYOF FORMING ANYTHING WHICH HAD SHARPER COLLISIONS THAN AN ELABORATENOTION OF GOG AND MAGOG IT WAS AS FREE FROM INTERRUPTION AS A PLAN FORTHREADING THE STARS TOGETHER. AND DOROTHEA HAD SO OFTEN HAD TO CHECKHER WEARINESS AND IMPATIENCE OVER THIS QUESTIONABLE RIDDLEGUESSING ASIT REVEALED ITSELF TO HER INSTEAD OF THE FELLOWSHIP IN HIGH KNOWLEDGEWHICH WAS TO MAKE LIFE WORTHIER SHE COULD UNDERSTAND WELL ENOUGH NOWWHY HER HUSBAND HAD COME TO CLING TO HER AS POSSIBLY THE ONLY HOPELEFT THAT HIS LABORS WOULD EVER TAKE A SHAPE IN WHICH THEY COULD BEGIVEN TO THE WORLD. AT FIRST IT HAD SEEMED THAT HE WISHED TO KEEP EVENHER ALOOF FROM ANY CLOSE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HE WAS DOING BUT GRADUALLYTHE TERRIBLE STRINGENCY OF HUMAN NEEDTHE PROSPECT OF A TOO SPEEDYDEATHAND HERE DOROTHEAS PITY TURNED FROM HER OWN FUTURE TO HER HUSBANDSPASTNAY TO HIS PRESENT HARD STRUGGLE WITH A LOT WHICH HAD GROWN OUTOF THAT PAST THE LONELY LABOR THE AMBITION BREATHING HARDLY UNDER THEPRESSURE OF SELFDISTRUST THE GOAL RECEDING AND THE HEAVIER LIMBSAND NOW AT LAST THE SWORD VISIBLY TREMBLING ABOVE HIM AND HAD SHE NOTWISHED TO MARRY HIM THAT SHE MIGHT HELP HIM IN HIS LIFES LABORBUTSHE HAD THOUGHT THE WORK WAS TO BE SOMETHING GREATER WHICH SHE COULDSERVE IN DEVOUTLY FOR ITS OWN SAKE. WAS IT RIGHT EVEN TO SOOTHE HISGRIEFWOULD IT BE POSSIBLE EVEN IF SHE PROMISEDTO WORK AS IN ATREADMILL FRUITLESSLYAND YET COULD SHE DENY HIM COULD SHE SAY I REFUSE TO CONTENT THISPINING HUNGER IT WOULD BE REFUSING TO DO FOR HIM DEAD WHAT SHE WASALMOST SURE TO DO FOR HIM LIVING. IF HE LIVED AS LYDGATE HAD SAID HEMIGHT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS OR MORE HER LIFE WOULD CERTAINLY BE SPENT INHELPING HIM AND OBEYING HIM.STILL THERE WAS A DEEP DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT DEVOTION TO THE LIVINGAND THAT INDEFINITE PROMISE OF DEVOTION TO THE DEAD. WHILE HE LIVED HECOULD CLAIM NOTHING THAT SHE WOULD NOT STILL BE FREE TO REMONSTRATEAGAINST AND EVEN TO REFUSE. BUTTHE THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH HER MINDMORE THAN ONCE THOUGH SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE IN ITMIGHT HE NOT MEAN TODEMAND SOMETHING MORE FROM HER THAN SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO IMAGINE SINCEHE WANTED HER PLEDGE TO CARRY OUT HIS WISHES WITHOUT TELLING HEREXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE NO HIS HEART WAS BOUND UP IN HIS WORK ONLYTHAT WAS THE END FOR WHICH HIS FAILING LIFE WAS TO BE EKED OUT BY HERS.AND NOW IF SHE WERE TO SAY NO IF YOU DIE I WILL PUT NO FINGER TOYOUR WORKIT SEEMED AS IF SHE WOULD BE CRUSHING THAT BRUISED HEART.FOR FOUR HOURS DOROTHEA LAY IN THIS CONFLICT TILL SHE FELT ILL ANDBEWILDERED UNABLE TO RESOLVE PRAYING MUTELY. HELPLESS AS A CHILDWHICH HAS SOBBED AND SOUGHT TOO LONG SHE FELL INTO A LATE MORNINGSLEEP AND WHEN SHE WAKED MR. CASAUBON WAS ALREADY UP. TANTRIPP TOLDHER THAT HE HAD READ PRAYERS BREAKFASTED AND WAS IN THE LIBRARY.I NEVER SAW YOU LOOK SO PALE MADAM SAID TANTRIPP A SOLIDFIGUREDWOMAN WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE SISTERS AT LAUSANNE.WAS I EVER HIGHCOLORED TANTRIPP SAID DOROTHEA SMILING FAINTLY.WELL NOT TO SAY HIGHCOLORED BUT WITH A BLOOM LIKE A CHINY ROSE. BUTALWAYS SMELLING THOSE LEATHER BOOKS WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED DO REST ALITTLE THIS MORNING MADAM. LET ME SAY YOU ARE ILL AND NOT ABLE TO GOINTO THAT CLOSE LIBRARY.OH NO NO LET ME MAKE HASTE SAID DOROTHEA. MR. CASAUBON WANTS MEPARTICULARLY.WHEN SHE WENT DOWN SHE FELT SURE THAT SHE SHOULD PROMISE TO FULFIL HISWISHES BUT THAT WOULD BE LATER IN THE DAYNOT YET.AS DOROTHEA ENTERED THE LIBRARY MR. CASAUBON TURNED ROUND FROM THETABLE WHERE HE HAD BEEN PLACING SOME BOOKS AND SAIDI WAS WAITING FOR YOUR APPEARANCE MY DEAR. I HAD HOPED TO SET TO WORKAT ONCE THIS MORNING BUT I FIND MYSELF UNDER SOME INDISPOSITIONPROBABLY FROM TOO MUCH EXCITEMENT YESTERDAY. I AM GOING NOW TO TAKE ATURN IN THE SHRUBBERY SINCE THE AIR IS MILDER.I AM GLAD TO HEAR THAT SAID DOROTHEA. YOUR MIND I FEARED WAS TOOACTIVE LAST NIGHT.I WOULD FAIN HAVE IT SET AT REST ON THE POINT I LAST SPOKE OFDOROTHEA. YOU CAN NOW I HOPE GIVE ME AN ANSWER.MAY I COME OUT TO YOU IN THE GARDEN PRESENTLY SAID DOROTHEA WINNINGA LITTLE BREATHING SPACE IN THAT WAY.I SHALL BE IN THE YEWTREE WALK FOR THE NEXT HALFHOUR SAID MR.CASAUBON AND THEN HE LEFT HER.DOROTHEA FEELING VERY WEARY RANG AND ASKED TANTRIPP TO BRING HER SOMEWRAPS. SHE HAD BEEN SITTING STILL FOR A FEW MINUTES BUT NOT IN ANYRENEWAL OF THE FORMER CONFLICT SHE SIMPLY FELT THAT SHE WAS GOING TOSAY YES TO HER OWN DOOM SHE WAS TOO WEAK TOO FULL OF DREAD AT THETHOUGHT OF INFLICTING A KEENEDGED BLOW ON HER HUSBAND TO DO ANYTHINGBUT SUBMIT COMPLETELY. SHE SAT STILL AND LET TANTRIPP PUT ON HER BONNETAND SHAWL A PASSIVITY WHICH WAS UNUSUAL WITH HER FOR SHE LIKED TOWAIT ON HERSELF.GOD BLESS YOU MADAM SAID TANTRIPP WITH AN IRREPRESSIBLE MOVEMENTOF LOVE TOWARDS THE BEAUTIFUL GENTLE CREATURE FOR WHOM SHE FELT UNABLETO DO ANYTHING MORE NOW THAT SHE HAD FINISHED TYING THE BONNET.THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR DOROTHEAS HIGHLYSTRUNG FEELING AND SHE BURSTINTO TEARS SOBBING AGAINST TANTRIPPS ARM. BUT SOON SHE CHECKEDHERSELF DRIED HER EYES AND WENT OUT AT THE GLASS DOOR INTO THESHRUBBERY.I WISH EVERY BOOK IN THAT LIBRARY WAS BUILT INTO A CATICOM FOR YOURMASTER SAID TANTRIPP TO PRATT THE BUTLER FINDING HIM IN THEBREAKFASTROOM. SHE HAD BEEN AT ROME AND VISITED THE ANTIQUITIES ASWE KNOW AND SHE ALWAYS DECLINED TO CALL MR. CASAUBON ANYTHING BUTYOUR MASTER WHEN SPEAKING TO THE OTHER SERVANTS.PRATT LAUGHED. HE LIKED HIS MASTER VERY WELL BUT HE LIKED TANTRIPPBETTER.WHEN DOROTHEA WAS OUT ON THE GRAVEL WALKS SHE LINGERED AMONG THENEARER CLUMPS OF TREES HESITATING AS SHE HAD DONE ONCE BEFORE THOUGHFROM A DIFFERENT CAUSE. THEN SHE HAD FEARED LEST HER EFFORT ATFELLOWSHIP SHOULD BE UNWELCOME NOW SHE DREADED GOING TO THE SPOT WHERESHE FORESAW THAT SHE MUST BIND HERSELF TO A FELLOWSHIP FROM WHICH SHESHRANK. NEITHER LAW NOR THE WORLDS OPINION COMPELLED HER TO THISONLYHER HUSBANDS NATURE AND HER OWN COMPASSION ONLY THE IDEAL AND NOT THEREAL YOKE OF MARRIAGE. SHE SAW CLEARLY ENOUGH THE WHOLE SITUATION YETSHE WAS FETTERED SHE COULD NOT SMITE THE STRICKEN SOUL THAT ENTREATEDHERS. IF THAT WERE WEAKNESS DOROTHEA WAS WEAK. BUT THE HALFHOUR WASPASSING AND SHE MUST NOT DELAY LONGER. WHEN SHE ENTERED THE YEWTREEWALK SHE COULD NOT SEE HER HUSBAND BUT THE WALK HAD BENDS AND SHEWENT EXPECTING TO CATCH SIGHT OF HIS FIGURE WRAPPED IN A BLUE CLOAKWHICH WITH A WARM VELVET CAP WAS HIS OUTER GARMENT ON CHILL DAYS FORTHE GARDEN. IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT HE MIGHT BE RESTING IN THESUMMERHOUSE TOWARDS WHICH THE PATH DIVERGED A LITTLE. TURNING THEANGLE SHE COULD SEE HIM SEATED ON THE BENCH CLOSE TO A STONE TABLE.HIS ARMS WERE RESTING ON THE TABLE AND HIS BROW WAS BOWED DOWN ONTHEM THE BLUE CLOAK BEING DRAGGED FORWARD AND SCREENING HIS FACE ONEACH SIDE.HE EXHAUSTED HIMSELF LAST NIGHT DOROTHEA SAID TO HERSELF THINKINGAT FIRST THAT HE WAS ASLEEP AND THAT THE SUMMERHOUSE WAS TOO DAMP APLACE TO REST IN. BUT THEN SHE REMEMBERED THAT OF LATE SHE HAD SEEN HIMTAKE THAT ATTITUDE WHEN SHE WAS READING TO HIM AS IF HE FOUND ITEASIER THAN ANY OTHER AND THAT HE WOULD SOMETIMES SPEAK AS WELL ASLISTEN WITH HIS FACE DOWN IN THAT WAY. SHE WENT INTO THE SUMMERHOUSEAND SAID I AM COME EDWARD I AM READY.HE TOOK NO NOTICE AND SHE THOUGHT THAT HE MUST BE FAST ASLEEP. SHELAID HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER AND REPEATED I AM READY STILL HE WASMOTIONLESS AND WITH A SUDDEN CONFUSED FEAR SHE LEANED DOWN TO HIMTOOK OFF HIS VELVET CAP AND LEANED HER CHEEK CLOSE TO HIS HEAD CRYINGIN A DISTRESSED TONEWAKE DEAR WAKE LISTEN TO ME. I AM COME TO ANSWER. BUT DOROTHEANEVER GAVE HER ANSWER.LATER IN THE DAY LYDGATE WAS SEATED BY HER BEDSIDE AND SHE WASTALKING DELIRIOUSLY THINKING ALOUD AND RECALLING WHAT HAD GONETHROUGH HER MIND THE NIGHT BEFORE. SHE KNEW HIM AND CALLED HIM BY HISNAME BUT APPEARED TO THINK IT RIGHT THAT SHE SHOULD EXPLAIN EVERYTHINGTO HIM AND AGAIN AND AGAIN BEGGED HIM TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO HERHUSBAND.TELL HIM I SHALL GO TO HIM SOON I AM READY TO PROMISE. ONLY THINKINGABOUT IT WAS SO DREADFULIT HAS MADE ME ILL. NOT VERY ILL. I SHALL SOONBE BETTER. GO AND TELL HIM.BUT THE SILENCE IN HER HUSBANDS EAR WAS NEVER MORE TO BE BROKEN.CHAPTER XLIX.A TASK TOO STRONG FOR WIZARD SPELLSTHIS SQUIRE HAD BROUGHT ABOUTT IS EASY DROPPING STONES IN WELLSBUT WHO SHALL GET THEM OUTI WISH TO GOD WE COULD HINDER DOROTHEA FROM KNOWING THIS SAID SIRJAMES CHETTAM WITH A LITTLE FROWN ON HIS BROW AND AN EXPRESSION OFINTENSE DISGUST ABOUT HIS MOUTH.HE WAS STANDING ON THE HEARTHRUG IN THE LIBRARY AT LOWICK GRANGE ANDSPEAKING TO MR. BROOKE. IT WAS THE DAY AFTER MR. CASAUBON HAD BEENBURIED AND DOROTHEA WAS NOT YET ABLE TO LEAVE HER ROOM.THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT YOU KNOW CHETTAM AS SHE IS AN EXECUTRIXAND SHE LIKES TO GO INTO THESE THINGSPROPERTY LAND THAT KIND OFTHING. SHE HAS HER NOTIONS YOU KNOW SAID MR. BROOKE STICKING HISEYEGLASSES ON NERVOUSLY AND EXPLORING THE EDGES OF A FOLDED PAPERWHICH HE HELD IN HIS HAND AND SHE WOULD LIKE TO ACTDEPEND UPON ITAS AN EXECUTRIX DOROTHEA WOULD WANT TO ACT. AND SHE WAS TWENTYONE LASTDECEMBER YOU KNOW. I CAN HINDER NOTHING.SIR JAMES LOOKED AT THE CARPET FOR A MINUTE IN SILENCE AND THENLIFTING HIS EYES SUDDENLY FIXED THEM ON MR. BROOKE SAYING I WILLTELL YOU WHAT WE CAN DO. UNTIL DOROTHEA IS WELL ALL BUSINESS MUST BEKEPT FROM HER AND AS SOON AS SHE IS ABLE TO BE MOVED SHE MUST COME TOUS. BEING WITH CELIA AND THE BABY WILL BE THE BEST THING IN THE WORLDFOR HER AND WILL PASS AWAY THE TIME. AND MEANWHILE YOU MUST GET RID OFLADISLAW YOU MUST SEND HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY. HERE SIR JAMESS LOOKOF DISGUST RETURNED IN ALL ITS INTENSITY.MR. BROOKE PUT HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM WALKED TO THE WINDOW ANDSTRAIGHTENED HIS BACK WITH A LITTLE SHAKE BEFORE HE REPLIED.THAT IS EASILY SAID CHETTAM EASILY SAID YOU KNOW.MY DEAR SIR PERSISTED SIR JAMES RESTRAINING HIS INDIGNATION WITHINRESPECTFUL FORMS IT WAS YOU WHO BROUGHT HIM HERE AND YOU WHO KEEPHIM HEREI MEAN BY THE OCCUPATION YOU GIVE HIM.YES BUT I CANT DISMISS HIM IN AN INSTANT WITHOUT ASSIGNING REASONSMY DEAR CHETTAM. LADISLAW HAS BEEN INVALUABLE MOST SATISFACTORY. ICONSIDER THAT I HAVE DONE THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY A SERVICE BYBRINGING HIMBY BRINGING HIM YOU KNOW. MR. BROOKE ENDED WITH A NODTURNING ROUND TO GIVE IT.ITS A PITY THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY DIDNT DO WITHOUT HIM THATS ALLI HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT. AT ANY RATE AS DOROTHEAS BROTHERINLAW IFEEL WARRANTED IN OBJECTING STRONGLY TO HIS BEING KEPT HERE BY ANYACTION ON THE PART OF HER FRIENDS. YOU ADMIT I HOPE THAT I HAVE ARIGHT TO SPEAK ABOUT WHAT CONCERNS THE DIGNITY OF MY WIFES SISTERSIR JAMES WAS GETTING WARM.OF COURSE MY DEAR CHETTAM OF COURSE. BUT YOU AND I HAVE DIFFERENTIDEASDIFFERENTNOT ABOUT THIS ACTION OF CASAUBONS I SHOULD HOPE INTERRUPTED SIRJAMES. I SAY THAT HE HAS MOST UNFAIRLY COMPROMISED DOROTHEA. I SAYTHAT THERE NEVER WAS A MEANER MORE UNGENTLEMANLY ACTION THAN THISACODICIL OF THIS SORT TO A WILL WHICH HE MADE AT THE TIME OF HISMARRIAGE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND RELIANCE OF HER FAMILYA POSITIVEINSULT TO DOROTHEAWELL YOU KNOW CASAUBON WAS A LITTLE TWISTED ABOUT LADISLAW. LADISLAWHAS TOLD ME THE REASONDISLIKE OF THE BENT HE TOOK YOU KNOWLADISLAWDIDNT THINK MUCH OF CASAUBONS NOTIONS THOTH AND DAGONTHAT SORT OFTHING AND I FANCY THAT CASAUBON DIDNT LIKE THE INDEPENDENT POSITIONLADISLAW HAD TAKEN UP. I SAW THE LETTERS BETWEEN THEM YOU KNOW. POORCASAUBON WAS A LITTLE BURIED IN BOOKSHE DIDNT KNOW THE WORLD.ITS ALL VERY WELL FOR LADISLAW TO PUT THAT COLOR ON IT SAID SIRJAMES. BUT I BELIEVE CASAUBON WAS ONLY JEALOUS OF HIM ON DOROTHEASACCOUNT AND THE WORLD WILL SUPPOSE THAT SHE GAVE HIM SOME REASON ANDTHAT IS WHAT MAKES IT SO ABOMINABLECOUPLING HER NAME WITH THIS YOUNGFELLOWS.MY DEAR CHETTAM IT WONT LEAD TO ANYTHING YOU KNOW SAID MR.BROOKE SEATING HIMSELF AND STICKING ON HIS EYEGLASS AGAIN. ITS ALLOF A PIECE WITH CASAUBONS ODDITY. THIS PAPER NOW SYNOPTICALTABULATION AND SO ON FOR THE USE OF MRS. CASAUBON IT WAS LOCKED UPIN THE DESK WITH THE WILL. I SUPPOSE HE MEANT DOROTHEA TO PUBLISH HISRESEARCHES EH AND SHELL DO IT YOU KNOW SHE HAS GONE INTO HISSTUDIES UNCOMMONLY.MY DEAR SIR SAID SIR JAMES IMPATIENTLY THAT IS NEITHER HERE NORTHERE. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER YOU DONT SEE WITH ME THE PROPRIETY OFSENDING YOUNG LADISLAW AWAYWELL NO NOT THE URGENCY OF THE THING. BYANDBY PERHAPS IT MAYCOME ROUND. AS TO GOSSIP YOU KNOW SENDING HIM AWAY WONT HINDERGOSSIP. PEOPLE SAY WHAT THEY LIKE TO SAY NOT WHAT THEY HAVE CHAPTERAND VERSE FOR SAID MR BROOKE BECOMING ACUTE ABOUT THE TRUTHS THATLAY ON THE SIDE OF HIS OWN WISHES. I MIGHT GET RID OF LADISLAW UP TO ACERTAIN POINTTAKE AWAY THE PIONEER FROM HIM AND THAT SORT OF THINGBUT I COULDNT SEND HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY IF HE DIDNT CHOOSE TOGODIDNT CHOOSE YOU KNOW.MR. BROOKE PERSISTING AS QUIETLY AS IF HE WERE ONLY DISCUSSING THENATURE OF LAST YEARS WEATHER AND NODDING AT THE END WITH HIS USUALAMENITY WAS AN EXASPERATING FORM OF OBSTINACY.GOOD GOD SAID SIR JAMES WITH AS MUCH PASSION AS HE EVER SHOWEDLET US GET HIM A POST LET US SPEND MONEY ON HIM. IF HE COULD GO INTHE SUITE OF SOME COLONIAL GOVERNOR GRAMPUS MIGHT TAKE HIMAND I COULDWRITE TO FULKE ABOUT IT.BUT LADISLAW WONT BE SHIPPED OFF LIKE A HEAD OF CATTLE MY DEARFELLOW LADISLAW HAS HIS IDEAS. ITS MY OPINION THAT IF HE WERE TO PARTFROM ME TOMORROW YOUD ONLY HEAR THE MORE OF HIM IN THE COUNTRY. WITHHIS TALENT FOR SPEAKING AND DRAWING UP DOCUMENTS THERE ARE FEW MEN WHOCOULD COME UP TO HIM AS AN AGITATORAN AGITATOR YOU KNOW.AGITATOR SAID SIR JAMES WITH BITTER EMPHASIS FEELING THAT THESYLLABLES OF THIS WORD PROPERLY REPEATED WERE A SUFFICIENT EXPOSURE OFITS HATEFULNESS.BUT BE REASONABLE CHETTAM. DOROTHEA NOW. AS YOU SAY SHE HAD BETTERGO TO CELIA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SHE CAN STAY UNDER YOUR ROOF AND INTHE MEAN TIME THINGS MAY COME ROUND QUIETLY. DONT LET US BE FIRING OFFOUR GUNS IN A HURRY YOU KNOW. STANDISH WILL KEEP OUR COUNSEL AND THENEWS WILL BE OLD BEFORE ITS KNOWN. TWENTY THINGS MAY HAPPEN TO CARRYOFF LADISLAWWITHOUT MY DOING ANYTHING YOU KNOW.THEN I AM TO CONCLUDE THAT YOU DECLINE TO DO ANYTHINGDECLINE CHETTAMNOI DIDNT SAY DECLINE. BUT I REALLY DONT SEE WHATI COULD DO. LADISLAW IS A GENTLEMAN.I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID SIR JAMES HIS IRRITATION MAKING HIMFORGET HIMSELF A LITTLE. I AM SURE CASAUBON WAS NOT.WELL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE IF HE HAD MADE THE CODICIL TO HINDERHER FROM MARRYING AGAIN AT ALL YOU KNOW.I DONT KNOW THAT SAID SIR JAMES. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LESSINDELICATE.ONE OF POOR CASAUBONS FREAKS THAT ATTACK UPSET HIS BRAIN A LITTLE.IT ALL GOES FOR NOTHING. SHE DOESNT WANT TO MARRY LADISLAW.BUT THIS CODICIL IS FRAMED SO AS TO MAKE EVERYBODY BELIEVE THAT SHEDID. I DONT BELIEVE ANYTHING OF THE SORT ABOUT DOROTHEA SAID SIRJAMESTHEN FROWNINGLY BUT I SUSPECT LADISLAW. I TELL YOU FRANKLY ISUSPECT LADISLAW.I COULDNT TAKE ANY IMMEDIATE ACTION ON THAT GROUND CHETTAM. IN FACTIF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO PACK HIM OFFSEND HIM TO NORFOLK ISLANDTHATSORT OF THINGIT WOULD LOOK ALL THE WORSE FOR DOROTHEA TO THOSE WHOKNEW ABOUT IT. IT WOULD SEEM AS IF WE DISTRUSTED HERDISTRUSTED HERYOU KNOW.THAT MR. BROOKE HAD HIT ON AN UNDENIABLE ARGUMENT DID NOT TEND TOSOOTHE SIR JAMES. HE PUT OUT HIS HAND TO REACH HIS HAT IMPLYING THATHE DID NOT MEAN TO CONTEND FURTHER AND SAID STILL WITH SOME HEATWELL I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I THINK DOROTHEA WAS SACRIFICED ONCEBECAUSE HER FRIENDS WERE TOO CARELESS. I SHALL DO WHAT I CAN AS HERBROTHER TO PROTECT HER NOW.YOU CANT DO BETTER THAN GET HER TO FRESHITT AS SOON AS POSSIBLECHETTAM. I APPROVE THAT PLAN ALTOGETHER SAID MR. BROOKE WELL PLEASEDTHAT HE HAD WON THE ARGUMENT. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHLY INCONVENIENT TOHIM TO PART WITH LADISLAW AT THAT TIME WHEN A DISSOLUTION MIGHT HAPPENANY DAY AND ELECTORS WERE TO BE CONVINCED OF THE COURSE BY WHICH THEINTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY WOULD BE BEST SERVED. MR. BROOKE SINCERELYBELIEVED THAT THIS END COULD BE SECURED BY HIS OWN RETURN TOPARLIAMENT HE OFFERED THE FORCES OF HIS MIND HONESTLY TO THE NATION.CHAPTER L.THIS LOLLER HERE WOL PRECILEN US SOMEWHAT.NAY BY MY FATHERS SOULE THAT SCHAL HE NATSAYDE THE SCHIPMAN HERE SCHAL HE NOT PRECHEWE SCHAL NO GOSPEL GLOSEN HERE NE TECHE.WE LEVEN ALL IN THE GRET GOD QUOD HE.HE WOLDEN SOWEN SOME DIFFCULTEE.CANTERBURY TALES.DOROTHEA HAD BEEN SAFE AT FRESHITT HALL NEARLY A WEEK BEFORE SHE HADASKED ANY DANGEROUS QUESTIONS. EVERY MORNING NOW SHE SAT WITH CELIA INTHE PRETTIEST OF UPSTAIRS SITTINGROOMS OPENING INTO A SMALLCONSERVATORYCELIA ALL IN WHITE AND LAVENDER LIKE A BUNCH OF MIXEDVIOLETS WATCHING THE REMARKABLE ACTS OF THE BABY WHICH WERE SODUBIOUS TO HER INEXPERIENCED MIND THAT ALL CONVERSATION WAS INTERRUPTEDBY APPEALS FOR THEIR INTERPRETATION MADE TO THE ORACULAR NURSE.DOROTHEA SAT BY IN HER WIDOWS DRESS WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH RATHERPROVOKED CELIA AS BEING MUCH TOO SAD FOR NOT ONLY WAS BABY QUITEWELL BUT REALLY WHEN A HUSBAND HAD BEEN SO DULL AND TROUBLESOME WHILEHE LIVED AND BESIDES THAT HADWELL WELL SIR JAMES OF COURSE HADTOLD CELIA EVERYTHING WITH A STRONG REPRESENTATION HOW IMPORTANT ITWAS THAT DOROTHEA SHOULD NOT KNOW IT SOONER THAN WAS INEVITABLE.BUT MR. BROOKE HAD BEEN RIGHT IN PREDICTING THAT DOROTHEA WOULD NOTLONG REMAIN PASSIVE WHERE ACTION HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO HER SHE KNEW THEPURPORT OF HER HUSBANDS WILL MADE AT THE TIME OF THEIR MARRIAGE ANDHER MIND AS SOON AS SHE WAS CLEARLY CONSCIOUS OF HER POSITION WASSILENTLY OCCUPIED WITH WHAT SHE OUGHT TO DO AS THE OWNER OF LOWICKMANOR WITH THE PATRONAGE OF THE LIVING ATTACHED TO IT.ONE MORNING WHEN HER UNCLE PAID HIS USUAL VISIT THOUGH WITH AN UNUSUALALACRITY IN HIS MANNER WHICH HE ACCOUNTED FOR BY SAYING THAT IT WAS NOWPRETTY CERTAIN PARLIAMENT WOULD BE DISSOLVED FORTHWITH DOROTHEA SAIDUNCLE IT IS RIGHT NOW THAT I SHOULD CONSIDER WHO IS TO HAVE THELIVING AT LOWICK. AFTER MR. TUCKER HAD BEEN PROVIDED FOR I NEVER HEARDMY HUSBAND SAY THAT HE HAD ANY CLERGYMAN IN HIS MIND AS A SUCCESSOR TOHIMSELF. I THINK I OUGHT TO HAVE THE KEYS NOW AND GO TO LOWICK TOEXAMINE ALL MY HUSBANDS PAPERS. THERE MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WOULDTHROW LIGHT ON HIS WISHES.NO HURRY MY DEAR SAID MR. BROOKE QUIETLY. BYANDBY YOU KNOWYOU CAN GO IF YOU LIKE. BUT I CAST MY EYES OVER THINGS IN THE DESKSAND DRAWERSTHERE WAS NOTHINGNOTHING BUT DEEP SUBJECTS YOUKNOWBESIDES THE WILL. EVERYTHING CAN BE DONE BYANDBY. AS TO THELIVING I HAVE HAD AN APPLICATION FOR INTEREST ALREADYI SHOULD SAYRATHER GOOD. MR. TYKE HAS BEEN STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO MEI HADSOMETHING TO DO WITH GETTING HIM AN APPOINTMENT BEFORE. AN APOSTOLICMAN I BELIEVETHE SORT OF THING THAT WOULD SUIT YOU MY DEAR.I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE FULLER KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HIM UNCLE AND JUDGE FORMYSELF IF MR. CASAUBON HAS NOT LEFT ANY EXPRESSION OF HIS WISHES. HEHAS PERHAPS MADE SOME ADDITION TO HIS WILLTHERE MAY BE SOMEINSTRUCTIONS FOR ME SAID DOROTHEA WHO HAD ALL THE WHILE HAD THISCONJECTURE IN HER MIND WITH RELATION TO HER HUSBANDS WORK.NOTHING ABOUT THE RECTORY MY DEARNOTHING SAID MR.

BYANDBY YOUKNOW.I AM QUITE WELL NOW UNCLE I WISH TO EXERT MYSELF.WELL WELL WE SHALL SEE. BUT I MUST RUN AWAY NOWI HAVE NO END OFWORK NOWITS A CRISISA POLITICAL CRISIS YOU KNOW. AND HERE IS CELIAAND HER LITTLE MANYOU ARE AN AUNT YOU KNOW NOW AND I AM A SORT OFGRANDFATHER SAID MR. BROOKE WITH PLACID HURRY ANXIOUS TO GET AWAYAND TELL CHETTAM THAT IT WOULD NOT BE HIS MR. BROOKES FAULT IFDOROTHEA INSISTED ON LOOKING INTO EVERYTHING.DOROTHEA SANK BACK IN HER CHAIR WHEN HER UNCLE HAD LEFT THE ROOM ANDCAST HER EYES DOWN MEDITATIVELY ON HER CROSSED HANDS.LOOK DODO LOOK AT HIM DID YOU EVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE THAT SAIDCELIA IN HER COMFORTABLE STACCATO.WHAT KITTY SAID DOROTHEA LIFTING HER EYES RATHER ABSENTLY.WHAT WHY HIS UPPER LIP SEE HOW HE IS DRAWING IT DOWN AS IF HEMEANT TO MAKE A FACE. ISNT IT WONDERFUL HE MAY HAVE HIS LITTLETHOUGHTS. I WISH NURSE WERE HERE. DO LOOK AT HIM.A LARGE TEAR WHICH HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME GATHERING ROLLED DOWNDOROTHEAS CHEEK AS SHE LOOKED UP AND TRIED TO SMILE.DONT BE SAD DODO KISS BABY. WHAT ARE YOU BROODING OVER SO I AMSURE YOU DID EVERYTHING AND A GREAT DEAL TOO MUCH. YOU SHOULD BE HAPPYNOW.I WONDER IF SIR JAMES WOULD DRIVE ME TO LOWICK. I WANT TO LOOK OVEREVERYTHINGTO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY WORDS WRITTEN FOR ME.YOU ARE NOT TO GO TILL MR. LYDGATE SAYS YOU MAY GO. AND HE HAS NOTSAID SO YET HERE YOU ARE NURSE TAKE BABY AND WALK UP AND DOWN THEGALLERY. BESIDES YOU HAVE GOT A WRONG NOTION IN YOUR HEAD AS USUALDODOI CAN SEE THAT IT VEXES ME.WHERE AM I WRONG KITTY SAID DOROTHEA QUITE MEEKLY. SHE WAS ALMOSTREADY NOW TO THINK CELIA WISER THAN HERSELF AND WAS REALLY WONDERINGWITH SOME FEAR WHAT HER WRONG NOTION WAS. CELIA FELT HER ADVANTAGE ANDWAS DETERMINED TO USE IT. NONE OF THEM KNEW DODO AS WELL AS SHE DID ORKNEW HOW TO MANAGE HER. SINCE CELIAS BABY WAS BORN SHE HAD HAD A NEWSENSE OF HER MENTAL SOLIDITY AND CALM WISDOM. IT SEEMED CLEAR THATWHERE THERE WAS A BABY THINGS WERE RIGHT ENOUGH AND THAT ERROR INGENERAL WAS A MERE LACK OF THAT CENTRAL POISING FORCE.I CAN SEE WHAT YOU ARE THINKING OF AS WELL AS CAN BE DODO SAIDCELIA. YOU ARE WANTING TO FIND OUT IF THERE IS ANYTHING UNCOMFORTABLEFOR YOU TO DO NOW ONLY BECAUSE MR. CASAUBON WISHED IT. AS IF YOU HADNOT BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE ENOUGH BEFORE. AND HE DOESNT DESERVE IT ANDYOU WILL FIND THAT OUT. HE HAS BEHAVED VERY BADLY. JAMES IS AS ANGRYWITH HIM AS CAN BE. AND I HAD BETTER TELL YOU TO PREPARE YOU.CELIA SAID DOROTHEA ENTREATINGLY YOU DISTRESS ME. TELL ME AT ONCEWHAT YOU MEAN. IT GLANCED THROUGH HER MIND THAT MR. CASAUBON HAD LEFTTHE PROPERTY AWAY FROM HERWHICH WOULD NOT BE SO VERY DISTRESSING.WHY HE HAS MADE A CODICIL TO HIS WILL TO SAY THE PROPERTY WAS ALL TOGO AWAY FROM YOU IF YOU MARRIEDI MEANTHAT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE SAID DOROTHEA BREAKING IN IMPETUOUSLY.BUT IF YOU MARRIED MR. LADISLAW NOT ANYBODY ELSE CELIA WENT ON WITHPERSEVERING QUIETUDE. OF COURSE THAT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE IN ONEWAYYOU NEVER WOULD MARRY MR. LADISLAW BUT THAT ONLY MAKES IT WORSEOF MR. CASAUBON.THE BLOOD RUSHED TO DOROTHEAS FACE AND NECK PAINFULLY. BUT CELIA WASADMINISTERING WHAT SHE THOUGHT A SOBERING DOSE OF FACT. IT WAS TAKINGUP NOTIONS THAT HAD DONE DODOS HEALTH SO MUCH HARM. SO SHE WENT ON INHER NEUTRAL TONE AS IF SHE HAD BEEN REMARKING ON BABYS ROBES.JAMES SAYS SO. HE SAYS IT IS ABOMINABLE AND NOT LIKE A GENTLEMAN. ANDTHERE NEVER WAS A BETTER JUDGE THAN JAMES. IT IS AS IF MR. CASAUBONWANTED TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD WISH TO MARRY MR.LADISLAWWHICH IS RIDICULOUS. ONLY JAMES SAYS IT WAS TO HINDER MR.LADISLAW FROM WANTING TO MARRY YOU FOR YOUR MONEYJUST AS IF HE EVERWOULD THINK OF MAKING YOU AN OFFER. MRS. CADWALLADER SAID YOU MIGHT ASWELL MARRY AN ITALIAN WITH WHITE MICE BUT I MUST JUST GO AND LOOK ATBABY CELIA ADDED WITHOUT THE LEAST CHANGE OF TONE THROWING A LIGHTSHAWL OVER HER AND TRIPPING AWAY.DOROTHEA BY THIS TIME HAD TURNED COLD AGAIN AND NOW THREW HERSELF BACKHELPLESSLY IN HER CHAIR. SHE MIGHT HAVE COMPARED HER EXPERIENCE AT THATMOMENT TO THE VAGUE ALARMED CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HER LIFE WAS TAKING ONA NEW FORM THAT SHE WAS UNDERGOING A METAMORPHOSIS IN WHICH MEMORYWOULD NOT ADJUST ITSELF TO THE STIRRING OF NEW ORGANS. EVERYTHING WASCHANGING ITS ASPECT HER HUSBANDS CONDUCT HER OWN DUTEOUS FEELINGTOWARDS HIM EVERY STRUGGLE BETWEEN THEMAND YET MORE HER WHOLERELATION TO WILL LADISLAW. HER WORLD WAS IN A STATE OF CONVULSIVECHANGE THE ONLY THING SHE COULD SAY DISTINCTLY TO HERSELF WAS THATSHE MUST WAIT AND THINK ANEW. ONE CHANGE TERRIFIED HER AS IF IT HADBEEN A SIN IT WAS A VIOLENT SHOCK OF REPULSION FROM HER DEPARTEDHUSBAND WHO HAD HAD HIDDEN THOUGHTS PERHAPS PERVERTING EVERYTHING SHESAID AND DID. THEN AGAIN SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF ANOTHER CHANGE WHICH ALSOMADE HER TREMULOUS IT WAS A SUDDEN STRANGE YEARNING OF HEART TOWARDSWILL LADISLAW. IT HAD NEVER BEFORE ENTERED HER MIND THAT HE COULDUNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BE HER LOVER CONCEIVE THE EFFECT OF THESUDDEN REVELATION THAT ANOTHER HAD THOUGHT OF HIM IN THAT LIGHTTHATPERHAPS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF SUCH A POSSIBILITYAND THISWITH THE HURRYING CROWDING VISION OF UNFITTING CONDITIONS ANDQUESTIONS NOT SOON TO BE SOLVED.IT SEEMED A LONG WHILESHE DID NOT KNOW HOW LONGBEFORE SHE HEARD CELIASAYING THAT WILL DO NURSE HE WILL BE QUIET ON MY LAP NOW. YOU CANGO TO LUNCH AND LET GARRATT STAY IN THE NEXT ROOM. WHAT I THINKDODO CELIA WENT ON OBSERVING NOTHING MORE THAN THAT DOROTHEA WASLEANING BACK IN HER CHAIR AND LIKELY TO BE PASSIVE IS THAT MR.CASAUBON WAS SPITEFUL. I NEVER DID LIKE HIM AND JAMES NEVER DID. ITHINK THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH WERE DREADFULLY SPITEFUL. AND NOW HE HASBEHAVED IN THIS WAY I AM SURE RELIGION DOES NOT REQUIRE YOU TO MAKEYOURSELF UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT HIM. IF HE HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY THAT IS AMERCY AND YOU OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL. WE SHOULD NOT GRIEVE SHOULD WEBABY SAID CELIA CONFIDENTIALLY TO THAT UNCONSCIOUS CENTRE AND POISEOF THE WORLD WHO HAD THE MOST REMARKABLE FISTS ALL COMPLETE EVEN TOTHE NAILS AND HAIR ENOUGH REALLY WHEN YOU TOOK HIS CAP OFF TOMAKEYOU DIDNT KNOW WHATIN SHORT HE WAS BOUDDHA IN A WESTERN FORM.AT THIS CRISIS LYDGATE WAS ANNOUNCED AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HESAID WAS I FEAR YOU ARE NOT SO WELL AS YOU WERE MRS. CASAUBON HAVEYOU BEEN AGITATED ALLOW ME TO FEEL YOUR PULSE. DOROTHEAS HAND WAS OFA MARBLE COLDNESS.SHE WANTS TO GO TO LOWICK TO LOOK OVER PAPERS SAID CELIA. SHEOUGHT NOT OUGHT SHELYDGATE DID NOT SPEAK FOR A FEW MOMENTS. THEN HE SAID LOOKING ATDOROTHEA. I HARDLY KNOW. IN MY OPINION MRS. CASAUBON SHOULD DO WHATWOULD GIVE HER THE MOST REPOSE OF MIND. THAT REPOSE WILL NOT ALWAYSCOME FROM BEING FORBIDDEN TO ACT.THANK YOU SAID DOROTHEA EXERTING HERSELF I AM SURE THAT IS WISE.THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WHICH I OUGHT TO ATTEND TO. WHY SHOULD I SITHERE IDLE THEN WITH AN EFFORT TO RECALL SUBJECTS NOT CONNECTED WITHHER AGITATION SHE ADDED ABRUPTLY YOU KNOW EVERY ONE IN MIDDLEMARCHI THINK MR. LYDGATE. I SHALL ASK YOU TO TELL ME A GREAT DEAL. I HAVESERIOUS THINGS TO DO NOW. I HAVE A LIVING TO GIVE AWAY. YOU KNOW MR.TYKE AND ALL THE BUT DOROTHEAS EFFORT WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER SHEBROKE OFF AND BURST INTO SOBS.LYDGATE MADE HER DRINK A DOSE OF SAL VOLATILE.LET MRS. CASAUBON DO AS SHE LIKES HE SAID TO SIR JAMES WHOM HEASKED TO SEE BEFORE QUITTING THE HOUSE. SHE WANTS PERFECT FREEDOM ITHINK MORE THAN ANY OTHER PRESCRIPTION.HIS ATTENDANCE ON DOROTHEA WHILE HER BRAIN WAS EXCITED HAD ENABLED HIMTO FORM SOME TRUE CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING THE TRIALS OF HER LIFE. HEFELT SURE THAT SHE HAD BEEN SUFFERING FROM THE STRAIN AND CONFLICT OFSELFREPRESSION AND THAT SHE WAS LIKELY NOW TO FEEL HERSELF ONLY INANOTHER SORT OF PINFOLD THAN THAT FROM WHICH SHE HAD BEEN RELEASED.LYDGATES ADVICE WAS ALL THE EASIER FOR SIR JAMES TO FOLLOW WHEN HEFOUND THAT CELIA HAD ALREADY TOLD DOROTHEA THE UNPLEASANT FACT ABOUTTHE WILL. THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT NOWNO REASON FOR ANY FURTHER DELAYIN THE EXECUTION OF NECESSARY BUSINESS. AND THE NEXT DAY SIR JAMESCOMPLIED AT ONCE WITH HER REQUEST THAT HE WOULD DRIVE HER TO LOWICK.I HAVE NO WISH TO STAY THERE AT PRESENT SAID DOROTHEA I COULDHARDLY BEAR IT. I AM MUCH HAPPIER AT FRESHITT WITH CELIA. I SHALL BEABLE TO THINK BETTER ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE AT LOWICK BY LOOKING ATIT FROM A DISTANCE. AND I SHOULD LIKE TO BE AT THE GRANGE A LITTLEWHILE WITH MY UNCLE AND GO ABOUT IN ALL THE OLD WALKS AND AMONG THEPEOPLE IN THE VILLAGE.NOT YET I THINK. YOUR UNCLE IS HAVING POLITICAL COMPANY AND YOU AREBETTER OUT OF THE WAY OF SUCH DOINGS SAID SIR JAMES WHO AT THATMOMENT THOUGHT OF THE GRANGE CHIEFLY AS A HAUNT OF YOUNG LADISLAWS.BUT NO WORD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND DOROTHEA ABOUT THE OBJECTIONABLEPART OF THE WILL INDEED BOTH OF THEM FELT THAT THE MENTION OF ITBETWEEN THEM WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE. SIR JAMES WAS SHY EVEN WITH MENABOUT DISAGREEABLE SUBJECTS AND THE ONE THING THAT DOROTHEA WOULD HAVECHOSEN TO SAY IF SHE HAD SPOKEN ON THE MATTER AT ALL WAS FORBIDDEN TOHER AT PRESENT BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO BE A FURTHER EXPOSURE OF HERHUSBANDS INJUSTICE. YET SHE DID WISH THAT SIR JAMES COULD KNOW WHATHAD PASSED BETWEEN HER AND HER HUSBAND ABOUT WILL LADISLAWS MORALCLAIM ON THE PROPERTY IT WOULD THEN SHE THOUGHT BE APPARENT TO HIMAS IT WAS TO HER THAT HER HUSBANDS STRANGE INDELICATE PROVISO HADBEEN CHIEFLY URGED BY HIS BITTER RESISTANCE TO THAT IDEA OF CLAIM ANDNOT MERELY BY PERSONAL FEELINGS MORE DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT. ALSO ITMUST BE ADMITTED DOROTHEA WISHED THAT THIS COULD BE KNOWN FOR WILLSSAKE SINCE HER FRIENDS SEEMED TO THINK OF HIM AS SIMPLY AN OBJECT OFMR. CASAUBONS CHARITY. WHY SHOULD HE BE COMPARED WITH AN ITALIANCARRYING WHITE MICE THAT WORD QUOTED FROM MRS. CADWALLADER SEEMED LIKEA MOCKING TRAVESTY WROUGHT IN THE DARK BY AN IMPISH FINGER.AT LOWICK DOROTHEA SEARCHED DESK AND DRAWERSEARCHED ALL HER HUSBANDSPLACES OF DEPOSIT FOR PRIVATE WRITING BUT FOUND NO PAPER ADDRESSEDESPECIALLY TO HER EXCEPT THAT SYNOPTICAL TABULATION WHICH WASPROBABLY ONLY THE BEGINNING OF MANY INTENDED DIRECTIONS FOR HERGUIDANCE. IN CARRYING OUT THIS BEQUEST OF LABOR TO DOROTHEA AS IN ALLELSE MR. CASAUBON HAD BEEN SLOW AND HESITATING OPPRESSED IN THE PLANOF TRANSMITTING HIS WORK AS HE HAD BEEN IN EXECUTING IT BY THE SENSEOF MOVING HEAVILY IN A DIM AND CLOGGING MEDIUM DISTRUST OF DOROTHEASCOMPETENCE TO ARRANGE WHAT HE HAD PREPARED WAS SUBDUED ONLY BY DISTRUSTOF ANY OTHER REDACTOR. BUT HE HAD COME AT LAST TO CREATE A TRUST FORHIMSELF OUT OF DOROTHEAS NATURE SHE COULD DO WHAT SHE RESOLVED TO DOAND HE WILLINGLY IMAGINED HER TOILING UNDER THE FETTERS OF A PROMISE TOERECT A TOMB WITH HIS NAME UPON IT. NOT THAT MR. CASAUBON CALLED THEFUTURE VOLUMES A TOMB HE CALLED THEM THE KEY TO ALL MYTHOLOGIES. BUTTHE MONTHS GAINED ON HIM AND LEFT HIS PLANS BELATED HE HAD ONLY HADTIME TO ASK FOR THAT PROMISE BY WHICH HE SOUGHT TO KEEP HIS COLD GRASPON DOROTHEAS LIFE.THE GRASP HAD SLIPPED AWAY. BOUND BY A PLEDGE GIVEN FROM THE DEPTHS OFHER PITY SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF UNDERTAKING A TOIL WHICH HERJUDGMENT WHISPERED WAS VAIN FOR ALL USES EXCEPT THAT CONSECRATION OFFAITHFULNESS WHICH IS A SUPREME USE. BUT NOW HER JUDGMENT INSTEAD OFBEING CONTROLLED BY DUTEOUS DEVOTION WAS MADE ACTIVE BY THEIMBITTERING DISCOVERY THAT IN HER PAST UNION THERE HAD LURKED THEHIDDEN ALIENATION OF SECRECY AND SUSPICION. THE LIVING SUFFERING MANWAS NO LONGER BEFORE HER TO AWAKEN HER PITY THERE REMAINED ONLY THERETROSPECT OF PAINFUL SUBJECTION TO A HUSBAND WHOSE THOUGHTS HAD BEENLOWER THAN SHE HAD BELIEVED WHOSE EXORBITANT CLAIMS FOR HIMSELF HADEVEN BLINDED HIS SCRUPULOUS CARE FOR HIS OWN CHARACTER AND MADE HIMDEFEAT HIS OWN PRIDE BY SHOCKING MEN OF ORDINARY HONOR. AS FOR THEPROPERTY WHICH WAS THE SIGN OF THAT BROKEN TIE SHE WOULD HAVE BEENGLAD TO BE FREE FROM IT AND HAVE NOTHING MORE THAN HER ORIGINAL FORTUNEWHICH HAD BEEN SETTLED ON HER IF THERE HAD NOT BEEN DUTIES ATTACHED TOOWNERSHIP WHICH SHE OUGHT NOT TO FLINCH FROM. ABOUT THIS PROPERTY MANYTROUBLOUS QUESTIONS INSISTED ON RISING HAD SHE NOT BEEN RIGHT INTHINKING THAT THE HALF OF IT OUGHT TO GO TO WILL LADISLAWBUT WAS ITNOT IMPOSSIBLE NOW FOR HER TO DO THAT ACT OF JUSTICE MR. CASAUBON HADTAKEN A CRUELLY EFFECTIVE MEANS OF HINDERING HER EVEN WITH INDIGNATIONAGAINST HIM IN HER HEART ANY ACT THAT SEEMED A TRIUMPHANT ELUDING OFHIS PURPOSE REVOLTED HER.AFTER COLLECTING PAPERS OF BUSINESS WHICH SHE WISHED TO EXAMINE SHELOCKED UP AGAIN THE DESKS AND DRAWERSALL EMPTY OF PERSONAL WORDS FORHEREMPTY OF ANY SIGN THAT IN HER HUSBANDS LONELY BROODING HIS HEARTHAD GONE OUT TO HER IN EXCUSE OR EXPLANATION AND SHE WENT BACK TOFRESHITT WITH THE SENSE THAT AROUND HIS LAST HARD DEMAND AND HIS LASTINJURIOUS ASSERTION OF HIS POWER THE SILENCE WAS UNBROKEN.DOROTHEA TRIED NOW TO TURN HER THOUGHTS TOWARDS IMMEDIATE DUTIES ANDONE OF THESE WAS OF A KIND WHICH OTHERS WERE DETERMINED TO REMIND HEROF. LYDGATES EAR HAD CAUGHT EAGERLY HER MENTION OF THE LIVING AND ASSOON AS HE COULD HE REOPENED THE SUBJECT SEEING HERE A POSSIBILITY OFMAKING AMENDS FOR THE CASTINGVOTE HE HAD ONCE GIVEN WITH ANILLSATISFIED CONSCIENCE. INSTEAD OF TELLING YOU ANYTHING ABOUT MR.TYKE HE SAID I SHOULD LIKE TO SPEAK OF ANOTHER MANMR. FAREBROTHERTHE VICAR OF ST. BOTOLPHS. HIS LIVING IS A POOR ONE AND GIVES HIM ASTINTED PROVISION FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY. HIS MOTHER AUNT ANDSISTER ALL LIVE WITH HIM AND DEPEND UPON HIM. I BELIEVE HE HAS NEVERMARRIED BECAUSE OF THEM. I NEVER HEARD SUCH GOOD PREACHING AS HISSUCHPLAIN EASY ELOQUENCE. HE WOULD HAVE DONE TO PREACH AT ST. PAULS CROSSAFTER OLD LATIMER. HIS TALK IS JUST AS GOOD ABOUT ALL SUBJECTSORIGINAL SIMPLE CLEAR. I THINK HIM A REMARKABLE FELLOW HE OUGHT TOHAVE DONE MORE THAN HE HAS DONE.WHY HAS HE NOT DONE MORE SAID DOROTHEA INTERESTED NOW IN ALL WHOHAD SLIPPED BELOW THEIR OWN INTENTION.THATS A HARD QUESTION SAID LYDGATE. I FIND MYSELF THAT ITSUNCOMMONLY DIFFICULT TO MAKE THE RIGHT THING WORK THERE ARE SO MANYSTRINGS PULLING AT ONCE. FAREBROTHER OFTEN HINTS THAT HE HAS GOT INTOTHE WRONG PROFESSION HE WANTS A WIDER RANGE THAN THAT OF A POORCLERGYMAN AND I SUPPOSE HE HAS NO INTEREST TO HELP HIM ON. HE IS VERYFOND OF NATURAL HISTORY AND VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC MATTERS AND HE ISHAMPERED IN RECONCILING THESE TASTES WITH HIS POSITION. HE HAS NO MONEYTO SPAREHARDLY ENOUGH TO USE AND THAT HAS LED HIM INTOCARDPLAYINGMIDDLEMARCH IS A GREAT PLACE FOR WHIST. HE DOES PLAY FORMONEY AND HE WINS A GOOD DEAL. OF COURSE THAT TAKES HIM INTO COMPANY ALITTLE BENEATH HIM AND MAKES HIM SLACK ABOUT SOME THINGS AND YETWITH ALL THAT LOOKING AT HIM AS A WHOLE I THINK HE IS ONE OF THE MOSTBLAMELESS MEN I EVER KNEW. HE HAS NEITHER VENOM NOR DOUBLENESS IN HIMAND THOSE OFTEN GO WITH A MORE CORRECT OUTSIDE.I WONDER WHETHER HE SUFFERS IN HIS CONSCIENCE BECAUSE OF THAT HABITSAID DOROTHEA I WONDER WHETHER HE WISHES HE COULD LEAVE IT OFF.I HAVE NO DOUBT HE WOULD LEAVE IT OFF IF HE WERE TRANSPLANTED INTOPLENTY HE WOULD BE GLAD OF THE TIME FOR OTHER THINGS.MY UNCLE SAYS THAT MR. TYKE IS SPOKEN OF AS AN APOSTOLIC MAN SAIDDOROTHEA MEDITATIVELY. SHE WAS WISHING IT WERE POSSIBLE TO RESTORE THETIMES OF PRIMITIVE ZEAL AND YET THINKING OF MR. FAREBROTHER WITH ASTRONG DESIRE TO RESCUE HIM FROM HIS CHANCEGOTTEN MONEY.I DONT PRETEND TO SAY THAT FAREBROTHER IS APOSTOLIC SAID LYDGATE.HIS POSITION IS NOT QUITE LIKE THAT OF THE APOSTLES HE IS ONLY APARSON AMONG PARISHIONERS WHOSE LIVES HE HAS TO TRY AND MAKE BETTER.PRACTICALLY I FIND THAT WHAT IS CALLED BEING APOSTOLIC NOW IS ANIMPATIENCE OF EVERYTHING IN WHICH THE PARSON DOESNT CUT THE PRINCIPALFIGURE. I SEE SOMETHING OF THAT IN MR. TYKE AT THE HOSPITAL A GOODDEAL OF HIS DOCTRINE IS A SORT OF PINCHING HARD TO MAKE PEOPLEUNCOMFORTABLY AWARE OF HIM. BESIDES AN APOSTOLIC MAN AT LOWICKHEOUGHT TO THINK AS ST. FRANCIS DID THAT IT IS NEEDFUL TO PREACH TO THEBIRDS.TRUE SAID DOROTHEA. IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT SORT OF NOTIONS OURFARMERS AND LABORERS GET FROM THEIR TEACHING. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING INTOA VOLUME OF SERMONS BY MR. TYKE SUCH SERMONS WOULD BE OF NO USE ATLOWICKI MEAN ABOUT IMPUTED RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE PROPHECIES IN THEAPOCALYPSE. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THINKING OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICHCHRISTIANITY IS TAUGHT AND WHENEVER I FIND ONE WAY THAT MAKES IT AWIDER BLESSING THAN ANY OTHER I CLING TO THAT AS THE TRUESTI MEANTHAT WHICH TAKES IN THE MOST GOOD OF ALL KINDS AND BRINGS IN THE MOSTPEOPLE AS SHARERS IN IT. IT IS SURELY BETTER TO PARDON TOO MUCH THANTO CONDEMN TOO MUCH. BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MR. FAREBROTHER AND HEARHIM PREACH.DO SAID LYDGATE I TRUST TO THE EFFECT OF THAT. HE IS VERY MUCHBELOVED BUT HE HAS HIS ENEMIES TOO THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE WHO CANTFORGIVE AN ABLE MAN FOR DIFFERING FROM THEM. AND THAT MONEYWINNINGBUSINESS IS REALLY A BLOT. YOU DONT OF COURSE SEE MANY MIDDLEMARCHPEOPLE BUT MR. LADISLAW WHO IS CONSTANTLY SEEING MR. BROOKE IS AGREAT FRIEND OF MR. FAREBROTHERS OLD LADIES AND WOULD BE GLAD TO SINGTHE VICARS PRAISES. ONE OF THE OLD LADIESMISS NOBLE THE AUNTIS AWONDERFULLY QUAINT PICTURE OF SELFFORGETFUL GOODNESS AND LADISLAWGALLANTS HER ABOUT SOMETIMES. I MET THEM ONE DAY IN A BACK STREET YOUKNOW LADISLAWS LOOKA SORT OF DAPHNIS IN COAT AND WAISTCOAT AND THISLITTLE OLD MAID REACHING UP TO HIS ARMTHEY LOOKED LIKE A COUPLEDROPPED OUT OF A ROMANTIC COMEDY. BUT THE BEST EVIDENCE ABOUTFAREBROTHER IS TO SEE HIM AND HEAR HIM.HAPPILY DOROTHEA WAS IN HER PRIVATE SITTINGROOM WHEN THIS CONVERSATIONOCCURRED AND THERE WAS NO ONE PRESENT TO MAKE LYDGATES INNOCENTINTRODUCTION OF LADISLAW PAINFUL TO HER. AS WAS USUAL WITH HIM INMATTERS OF PERSONAL GOSSIP LYDGATE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN ROSAMONDSREMARK THAT SHE THOUGHT WILL ADORED MRS. CASAUBON. AT THAT MOMENT HEWAS ONLY CARING FOR WHAT WOULD RECOMMEND THE FAREBROTHER FAMILY AND HEHAD PURPOSELY GIVEN EMPHASIS TO THE WORST THAT COULD BE SAID ABOUT THEVICAR IN ORDER TO FORESTALL OBJECTIONS. IN THE WEEKS SINCE MR.CASAUBONS DEATH HE HAD HARDLY SEEN LADISLAW AND HE HAD HEARD NO RUMORTO WARN HIM THAT MR. BROOKES CONFIDENTIAL SECRETARY WAS A DANGEROUSSUBJECT WITH MRS. CASAUBON. WHEN HE WAS GONE HIS PICTURE OF LADISLAWLINGERED IN HER MIND AND DISPUTED THE GROUND WITH THAT QUESTION OF THELOWICK LIVING. WHAT WAS WILL LADISLAW THINKING ABOUT HER WOULD HE HEAROF THAT FACT WHICH MADE HER CHEEKS BURN AS THEY NEVER USED TO DO ANDHOW WOULD HE FEEL WHEN HE HEARD ITBUT SHE COULD SEE AS WELL ASPOSSIBLE HOW HE SMILED DOWN AT THE LITTLE OLD MAID. AN ITALIAN WITHWHITE MICEON THE CONTRARY HE WAS A CREATURE WHO ENTERED INTO EVERYONES FEELINGS AND COULD TAKE THE PRESSURE OF THEIR THOUGHT INSTEAD OFURGING HIS OWN WITH IRON RESISTANCE.CHAPTER LI.PARTY IS NATURE TOO AND YOU SHALL SEEBY FORCE OF LOGIC HOW THEY BOTH AGREETHE MANY IN THE ONE THE ONE IN MANYALL IS NOT SOME NOR SOME THE SAME AS ANYGENUS HOLDS SPECIES BOTH ARE GREAT OR SMALLONE GENUS HIGHEST ONE NOT HIGH AT ALLEACH SPECIES HAS ITS DIFFERENTIA TOOTHIS IS NOT THAT AND HE WAS NEVER YOUTHOUGH THIS AND THAT ARE AYES AND YOU AND HEARE LIKE AS ONE TO ONE OR THREE TO THREE.NO GOSSIP ABOUT MR. CASAUBONS WILL HAD YET REACHED LADISLAW THE AIRSEEMED TO BE FILLED WITH THE DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT AND THE COMINGELECTION AS THE OLD WAKES AND FAIRS WERE FILLED WITH THE RIVAL CLATTEROF ITINERANT SHOWS AND MORE PRIVATE NOISES WERE TAKEN LITTLE NOTICEOF. THE FAMOUS DRY ELECTION WAS AT HAND IN WHICH THE DEPTHS OFPUBLIC FEELING MIGHT BE MEASURED BY THE LOW FLOODMARK OF DRINK. WILLLADISLAW WAS ONE OF THE BUSIEST AT THIS TIME AND THOUGH DOROTHEASWIDOWHOOD WAS CONTINUALLY IN HIS THOUGHT HE WAS SO FAR FROM WISHING TOBE SPOKEN TO ON THE SUBJECT THAT WHEN LYDGATE SOUGHT HIM OUT TO TELLHIM WHAT HAD PASSED ABOUT THE LOWICK LIVING HE ANSWERED RATHERWASPISHLYWHY SHOULD YOU BRING ME INTO THE MATTER I NEVER SEE MRS. CASAUBONAND AM NOT LIKELY TO SEE HER SINCE SHE IS AT FRESHITT. I NEVER GOTHERE. IT IS TORY GROUND WHERE I AND THE PIONEER ARE NO MORE WELCOMETHAN A POACHER AND HIS GUN.THE FACT WAS THAT WILL HAD BEEN MADE THE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE BY OBSERVINGTHAT MR. BROOKE INSTEAD OF WISHING HIM AS BEFORE TO COME TO THEGRANGE OFTENER THAN WAS QUITE AGREEABLE TO HIMSELF SEEMED NOW TOCONTRIVE THAT HE SHOULD GO THERE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE. THIS WAS ASHUFFLING CONCESSION OF MR. BROOKES TO SIR JAMES CHETTAMS INDIGNANTREMONSTRANCE AND WILL AWAKE TO THE SLIGHTEST HINT IN THIS DIRECTIONCONCLUDED THAT HE WAS TO BE KEPT AWAY FROM THE GRANGE ON DOROTHEASACCOUNT. HER FRIENDS THEN REGARDED HIM WITH SOME SUSPICION THEIRFEARS WERE QUITE SUPERFLUOUS THEY WERE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN IF THEYIMAGINED THAT HE WOULD PUT HIMSELF FORWARD AS A NEEDY ADVENTURER TRYINGTO WIN THE FAVOR OF A RICH WOMAN.UNTIL NOW WILL HAD NEVER FULLY SEEN THE CHASM BETWEEN HIMSELF ANDDOROTHEAUNTIL NOW THAT HE WAS COME TO THE BRINK OF IT AND SAW HER ONTHE OTHER SIDE. HE BEGAN NOT WITHOUT SOME INWARD RAGE TO THINK OFGOING AWAY FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TOSHOW ANY FURTHER INTEREST IN DOROTHEA WITHOUT SUBJECTING HIMSELF TODISAGREEABLE IMPUTATIONSPERHAPS EVEN IN HER MIND WHICH OTHERS MIGHTTRY TO POISON.WE ARE FOREVER DIVIDED SAID WILL. I MIGHT AS WELL BE AT ROME SHEWOULD BE NO FARTHER FROM ME. BUT WHAT WE CALL OUR DESPAIR IS OFTENONLY THE PAINFUL EAGERNESS OF UNFED HOPE. THERE WERE PLENTY OF REASONSWHY HE SHOULD NOT GOPUBLIC REASONS WHY HE SHOULD NOT QUIT HIS POST ATTHIS CRISIS LEAVING MR. BROOKE IN THE LURCH WHEN HE NEEDED COACHINGFOR THE ELECTION AND WHEN THERE WAS SO MUCH CANVASSING DIRECT ANDINDIRECT TO BE CARRIED ON. WILL COULD NOT LIKE TO LEAVE HIS OWNCHESSMEN IN THE HEAT OF A GAME AND ANY CANDIDATE ON THE RIGHT SIDEEVEN IF HIS BRAIN AND MARROW HAD BEEN AS SOFT AS WAS CONSISTENT WITH AGENTLEMANLY BEARING MIGHT HELP TO TURN A MAJORITY. TO COACH MR. BROOKEAND KEEP HIM STEADILY TO THE IDEA THAT HE MUST PLEDGE HIMSELF TO VOTEFOR THE ACTUAL REFORM BILL INSTEAD OF INSISTING ON HIS INDEPENDENCEAND POWER OF PULLING UP IN TIME WAS NOT AN EASY TASK. MR.FAREBROTHERS PROPHECY OF A FOURTH CANDIDATE IN THE BAG HAD NOT YETBEEN FULFILLED NEITHER THE PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATE SOCIETY NOR ANYOTHER POWER ON THE WATCH TO SECURE A REFORMING MAJORITY SEEING A WORTHYNODUS FOR INTERFERENCE WHILE THERE WAS A SECOND REFORMING CANDIDATELIKE MR. BROOKE WHO MIGHT BE RETURNED AT HIS OWN EXPENSE AND THEFIGHT LAY ENTIRELY BETWEEN PINKERTON THE OLD TORY MEMBER BAGSTER THENEW WHIG MEMBER RETURNED AT THE LAST ELECTION AND BROOKE THE FUTUREINDEPENDENT MEMBER WHO WAS TO FETTER HIMSELF FOR THIS OCCASION ONLY.MR. HAWLEY AND HIS PARTY WOULD BEND ALL THEIR FORCES TO THE RETURN OFPINKERTON AND MR. BROOKES SUCCESS MUST DEPEND EITHER ON PLUMPERSWHICH WOULD LEAVE BAGSTER IN THE REAR OR ON THE NEW MINTING OF TORYVOTES INTO REFORMING VOTES. THE LATTER MEANS OF COURSE WOULD BEPREFERABLE.THIS PROSPECT OF CONVERTING VOTES WAS A DANGEROUS DISTRACTION TO MR.BROOKE HIS IMPRESSION THAT WAVERERS WERE LIKELY TO BE ALLURED BYWAVERING STATEMENTS AND ALSO THE LIABILITY OF HIS MIND TO STICK AFRESHAT OPPOSING ARGUMENTS AS THEY TURNED UP IN HIS MEMORY GAVE WILLLADISLAW MUCH TROUBLE.YOU KNOW THERE ARE TACTICS IN THESE THINGS SAID MR. BROOKE MEETINGPEOPLE HALFWAYTEMPERING YOUR IDEASSAYING WELL NOW THERESSOMETHING IN THAT AND SO ON. I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THIS IS A PECULIAROCCASIONTHE COUNTRY WITH A WILL OF ITS OWNPOLITICAL UNIONSTHAT SORTOF THINGBUT WE SOMETIMES CUT WITH RATHER TOO SHARP A KNIFE LADISLAW.THESE TENPOUND HOUSEHOLDERS NOW WHY TEN DRAW THE LINESOMEWHEREYES BUT WHY JUST AT TEN THATS A DIFFICULT QUESTION NOWIF YOU GO INTO IT.OF COURSE IT IS SAID WILL IMPATIENTLY. BUT IF YOU ARE TO WAIT TILLWE GET A LOGICAL BILL YOU MUST PUT YOURSELF FORWARD AS AREVOLUTIONIST AND THEN MIDDLEMARCH WOULD NOT ELECT YOU I FANCY. ASFOR TRIMMING THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR TRIMMING.MR. BROOKE ALWAYS ENDED BY AGREEING WITH LADISLAW WHO STILL APPEAREDTO HIM A SORT OF BURKE WITH A LEAVEN OF SHELLEY BUT AFTER AN INTERVALTHE WISDOM OF HIS OWN METHODS REASSERTED ITSELF AND HE WAS AGAIN DRAWNINTO USING THEM WITH MUCH HOPEFULNESS. AT THIS STAGE OF AFFAIRS HE WASIN EXCELLENT SPIRITS WHICH EVEN SUPPORTED HIM UNDER LARGE ADVANCES OFMONEY FOR HIS POWERS OF CONVINCING AND PERSUADING HAD NOT YET BEENTESTED BY ANYTHING MORE DIFFICULT THAN A CHAIRMANS SPEECH INTRODUCINGOTHER ORATORS OR A DIALOGUE WITH A MIDDLEMARCH VOTER FROM WHICH HECAME AWAY WITH A SENSE THAT HE WAS A TACTICIAN BY NATURE AND THAT ITWAS A PITY HE HAD NOT GONE EARLIER INTO THIS KIND OF THING. HE WAS ALITTLE CONSCIOUS OF DEFEAT HOWEVER WITH MR. MAWMSEY A CHIEFREPRESENTATIVE IN MIDDLEMARCH OF THAT GREAT SOCIAL POWER THE RETAILTRADER AND NATURALLY ONE OF THE MOST DOUBTFUL VOTERS IN THEBOROUGHWILLING FOR HIS OWN PART TO SUPPLY AN EQUAL QUALITY OF TEAS ANDSUGARS TO REFORMER AND ANTIREFORMER AS WELL AS TO AGREE IMPARTIALLYWITH BOTH AND FEELING LIKE THE BURGESSES OF OLD THAT THIS NECESSITY OFELECTING MEMBERS WAS A GREAT BURTHEN TO A TOWN FOR EVEN IF THERE WERENO DANGER IN HOLDING OUT HOPES TO ALL PARTIES BEFOREHAND THERE WOULDBE THE PAINFUL NECESSITY AT LAST OF DISAPPOINTING RESPECTABLE PEOPLEWHOSE NAMES WERE ON HIS BOOKS. HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE LARGEORDERS FROM MR. BROOKE OF TIPTON BUT THEN THERE WERE MANY OFPINKERTONS COMMITTEE WHOSE OPINIONS HAD A GREAT WEIGHT OF GROCERY ONTHEIR SIDE. MR. MAWMSEY THINKING THAT MR. BROOKE AS NOT TOO CLEVER INHIS INTELLECTS WAS THE MORE LIKELY TO FORGIVE A GROCER WHO GAVE AHOSTILE VOTE UNDER PRESSURE HAD BECOME CONFIDENTIAL IN HIS BACKPARLOR.AS TO REFORM SIR PUT IT IN A FAMILY LIGHT HE SAID RATTLING THESMALL SILVER IN HIS POCKET AND SMILING AFFABLY. WILL IT SUPPORT MRS.MAWMSEY AND ENABLE HER TO BRING UP SIX CHILDREN WHEN I AM NO MORE IPUT THE QUESTION FICTIOUSLY KNOWING WHAT MUST BE THE ANSWER. VERYWELL SIR. I ASK YOU WHAT AS A HUSBAND AND A FATHER I AM TO DO WHENGENTLEMEN COME TO ME AND SAY DO AS YOU LIKE MAWMSEY BUT IF YOU VOTEAGAINST US I SHALL GET MY GROCERIES ELSEWHERE WHEN I SUGAR MY LIQUORI LIKE TO FEEL THAT I AM BENEFITING THE COUNTRY BY MAINTAININGTRADESMEN OF THE RIGHT COLOR. THOSE VERY WORDS HAVE BEEN SPOKEN TO MESIR IN THE VERY CHAIR WHERE YOU ARE NOW SITTING. I DONT MEAN BY YOURHONORABLE SELF MR. BROOKE.NO NO NOTHATS NARROW YOU KNOW. UNTIL MY BUTLER COMPLAINS TO ME OFYOUR GOODS MR. MAWMSEY SAID MR. BROOKE SOOTHINGLY UNTIL I HEARTHAT YOU SEND BAD SUGARS SPICESTHAT SORT OF THINGI SHALL NEVER ORDERHIM TO GO ELSEWHERE.SIR I AM YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT AND GREATLY OBLIGED SAID MR. MAWMSEYFEELING THAT POLITICS WERE CLEARING UP A LITTLE. THERE WOULD BE SOMEPLEASURE IN VOTING FOR A GENTLEMAN WHO SPEAKS IN THAT HONORABLEMANNER.WELL YOU KNOW MR. MAWMSEY YOU WOULD FIND IT THE RIGHT THING TO PUTYOURSELF ON OUR SIDE. THIS REFORM WILL TOUCH EVERYBODY BYANDBYATHOROUGHLY POPULAR MEASUREA SORT OF A B C YOU KNOW THAT MUST COMEFIRST BEFORE THE REST CAN FOLLOW. I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT YOUVEGOT TO LOOK AT THE THING IN A FAMILY LIGHT BUT PUBLIC SPIRIT NOW.WERE ALL ONE FAMILY YOU KNOWITS ALL ONE CUPBOARD. SUCH A THING AS AVOTE NOW WHY IT MAY HELP TO MAKE MENS FORTUNES AT THE CAPETHERESNO KNOWING WHAT MAY BE THE EFFECT OF A VOTE MR. BROOKE ENDED WITH ASENSE OF BEING A LITTLE OUT AT SEA THOUGH FINDING IT STILL ENJOYABLE.BUT MR. MAWMSEY ANSWERED IN A TONE OF DECISIVE CHECK.I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR BUT I CANT AFFORD THAT. WHEN I GIVE A VOTE IMUST KNOW WHAT I AM DOING I MUST LOOK TO WHAT WILL BE THE EFFECTS ONMY TILL AND LEDGER SPEAKING RESPECTFULLY. PRICES ILL ADMIT ARE WHATNOBODY CAN KNOW THE MERITS OF AND THE SUDDEN FALLS AFTER YOUVE BOUGHTIN CURRANTS WHICH ARE A GOODS THAT WILL NOT KEEPIVE NEVER MYSELFSEEN INTO THE INS AND OUTS THERE WHICH IS A REBUKE TO HUMAN PRIDE. BUTAS TO ONE FAMILY THERES DEBTOR AND CREDITOR I HOPE THEYRE NOTGOING TO REFORM THAT AWAY ELSE I SHOULD VOTE FOR THINGS STAYING ASTHEY ARE. FEW MEN HAVE LESS NEED TO CRY FOR CHANGE THAN I HAVEPERSONALLY SPEAKINGTHAT IS FOR SELF AND FAMILY. I AM NOT ONE OF THOSEWHO HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE I MEAN AS TO RESPECTABILITY BOTH IN PARISHAND PRIVATE BUSINESS AND NOWAYS IN RESPECT OF YOUR HONORABLE SELF ANDCUSTOM WHICH YOU WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO SAY YOU WOULD NOT WITHDRAW FROMME VOTE OR NO VOTE WHILE THE ARTICLE SENT IN WAS SATISFACTORY.AFTER THIS CONVERSATION MR. MAWMSEY WENT UP AND BOASTED TO HIS WIFETHAT HE HAD BEEN RATHER TOO MANY FOR BROOKE OF TIPTON AND THAT HEDIDNT MIND SO MUCH NOW ABOUT GOING TO THE POLL.MR. BROOKE ON THIS OCCASION ABSTAINED FROM BOASTING OF HIS TACTICS TOLADISLAW WHO FOR HIS PART WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HEHAD NO CONCERN WITH ANY CANVASSING EXCEPT THE PURELY ARGUMENTATIVESORT AND THAT HE WORKED NO MEANER ENGINE THAN KNOWLEDGE. MR. BROOKENECESSARILY HAD HIS AGENTS WHO UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THEMIDDLEMARCH VOTER AND THE MEANS OF ENLISTING HIS IGNORANCE ON THE SIDEOF THE BILLWHICH WERE REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THE MEANS OF ENLISTING ITON THE SIDE AGAINST THE BILL. WILL STOPPED HIS EARS. OCCASIONALLYPARLIAMENT LIKE THE REST OF OUR LIVES EVEN TO OUR EATING AND APPARELCOULD HARDLY GO ON IF OUR IMAGINATIONS WERE TOO ACTIVE ABOUT PROCESSES.THERE WERE PLENTY OF DIRTYHANDED MEN IN THE WORLD TO DO DIRTYBUSINESS AND WILL PROTESTED TO HIMSELF THAT HIS SHARE IN BRINGING MR.BROOKE THROUGH WOULD BE QUITE INNOCENT.BUT WHETHER HE SHOULD SUCCEED IN THAT MODE OF CONTRIBUTING TO THEMAJORITY ON THE RIGHT SIDE WAS VERY DOUBTFUL TO HIM. HE HAD WRITTEN OUTVARIOUS SPEECHES AND MEMORANDA FOR SPEECHES BUT HE HAD BEGUN TOPERCEIVE THAT MR. BROOKES MIND IF IT HAD THE BURTHEN OF REMEMBERINGANY TRAIN OF THOUGHT WOULD LET IT DROP RUN AWAY IN SEARCH OF IT ANDNOT EASILY COME BACK AGAIN. TO COLLECT DOCUMENTS IS ONE MODE OF SERVINGYOUR COUNTRY AND TO REMEMBER THE CONTENTS OF A DOCUMENT IS ANOTHER.NO THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH MR. BROOKE COULD BE COERCED INTO THINKING OFTHE RIGHT ARGUMENTS AT THE RIGHT TIME WAS TO BE WELL PLIED WITH THEMTILL THEY TOOK UP ALL THE ROOM IN HIS BRAIN. BUT HERE THERE WAS THEDIFFICULTY OF FINDING ROOM SO MANY THINGS HAVING BEEN TAKEN INBEFOREHAND. MR. BROOKE HIMSELF OBSERVED THAT HIS IDEAS STOOD RATHER INHIS WAY WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING.HOWEVER LADISLAWS COACHING WAS FORTHWITH TO BE PUT TO THE TEST FORBEFORE THE DAY OF NOMINATION MR. BROOKE WAS TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF TO THEWORTHY ELECTORS OF MIDDLEMARCH FROM THE BALCONY OF THE WHITE HARTWHICH LOOKED OUT ADVANTAGEOUSLY AT AN ANGLE OF THE MARKETPLACECOMMANDING A LARGE AREA IN FRONT AND TWO CONVERGING STREETS. IT WAS AFINE MAY MORNING AND EVERYTHING SEEMED HOPEFUL THERE WAS SOMEPROSPECT OF AN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN BAGSTERS COMMITTEE AND BROOKESTO WHICH MR. BULSTRODE MR. STANDISH AS A LIBERAL LAWYER AND SUCHMANUFACTURERS AS MR. PLYMDALE AND MR. VINCY GAVE A SOLIDITY WHICHALMOST COUNTERBALANCED MR. HAWLEY AND HIS ASSOCIATES WHO SAT FORPINKERTON AT THE GREEN DRAGON. MR. BROOKE CONSCIOUS OF HAVING WEAKENEDTHE BLASTS OF THE TRUMPET AGAINST HIM BY HIS REFORMS AS A LANDLORDIN THE LAST HALF YEAR AND HEARING HIMSELF CHEERED A LITTLE AS HE DROVEINTO THE TOWN FELT HIS HEART TOLERABLY LIGHT UNDER HIS BUFFCOLOREDWAISTCOAT. BUT WITH REGARD TO CRITICAL OCCASIONS IT OFTEN HAPPENS THATALL MOMENTS SEEM COMFORTABLY REMOTE UNTIL THE LAST.THIS LOOKS WELL EH SAID MR. BROOKE AS THE CROWD GATHERED. I SHALLHAVE A GOOD AUDIENCE AT ANY RATE. I LIKE THIS NOWTHIS KIND OF PUBLICMADE UP OF ONES OWN NEIGHBORS YOU KNOW.THE WEAVERS AND TANNERS OF MIDDLEMARCH UNLIKE MR. MAWMSEY HAD NEVERTHOUGHT OF MR. BROOKE AS A NEIGHBOR AND WERE NOT MORE ATTACHED TO HIMTHAN IF HE HAD BEEN SENT IN A BOX FROM LONDON. BUT THEY LISTENEDWITHOUT MUCH DISTURBANCE TO THE SPEAKERS WHO INTRODUCED THE CANDIDATEONE OF THEMA POLITICAL PERSONAGE FROM BRASSING WHO CAME TO TELLMIDDLEMARCH ITS DUTYSPOKE SO FULLY THAT IT WAS ALARMING TO THINK WHATTHE CANDIDATE COULD FIND TO SAY AFTER HIM. MEANWHILE THE CROWD BECAMEDENSER AND AS THE POLITICAL PERSONAGE NEARED THE END OF HIS SPEECHMR. BROOKE FELT A REMARKABLE CHANGE IN HIS SENSATIONS WHILE HE STILLHANDLED HIS EYEGLASS TRIFLED WITH DOCUMENTS BEFORE HIM AND EXCHANGEDREMARKS WITH HIS COMMITTEE AS A MAN TO WHOM THE MOMENT OF SUMMONS WASINDIFFERENT.ILL TAKE ANOTHER GLASS OF SHERRY LADISLAW HE SAID WITH AN EASYAIR TO WILL WHO WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND PRESENTLY HANDED HIM THESUPPOSED FORTIFIER. IT WAS ILLCHOSEN FOR MR. BROOKE WAS AN ABSTEMIOUSMAN AND TO DRINK A SECOND GLASS OF SHERRY QUICKLY AT NO GREAT INTERVALFROM THE FIRST WAS A SURPRISE TO HIS SYSTEM WHICH TENDED TO SCATTER HISENERGIES INSTEAD OF COLLECTING THEM. PRAY PITY HIM SO MANY ENGLISHGENTLEMEN MAKE THEMSELVES MISERABLE BY SPEECHIFYING ON ENTIRELY PRIVATEGROUNDS WHEREAS MR. BROOKE WISHED TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY BY STANDING FORPARLIAMENTWHICH INDEED MAY ALSO BE DONE ON PRIVATE GROUNDS BUTBEING ONCE UNDERTAKEN DOES ABSOLUTELY DEMAND SOME SPEECHIFYING.IT WAS NOT ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF HIS SPEECH THAT MR. BROOKE WAS AT ALLANXIOUS THIS HE FELT SURE WOULD BE ALL RIGHT HE SHOULD HAVE ITQUITE PAT CUT OUT AS NEATLY AS A SET OF COUPLETS FROM POPE. EMBARKINGWOULD BE EASY BUT THE VISION OF OPEN SEA THAT MIGHT COME AFTER WASALARMING. AND QUESTIONS NOW HINTED THE DEMON JUST WAKING UP IN HISSTOMACH SOMEBODY MAY PUT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCHEDULES.LADISLAW HECONTINUED ALOUD JUST HAND ME THE MEMORANDUM OF THE SCHEDULES.WHEN MR. BROOKE PRESENTED HIMSELF ON THE BALCONY THE CHEERS WERE QUITELOUD ENOUGH TO COUNTERBALANCE THE YELLS GROANS BRAYINGS AND OTHEREXPRESSIONS OF ADVERSE THEORY WHICH WERE SO MODERATE THAT MR. STANDISHDECIDEDLY AN OLD BIRD OBSERVED IN THE EAR NEXT TO HIM THIS LOOKSDANGEROUS BY GOD HAWLEY HAS GOT SOME DEEPER PLAN THAN THIS. STILLTHE CHEERS WERE EXHILARATING AND NO CANDIDATE COULD LOOK MORE AMIABLETHAN MR. BROOKE WITH THE MEMORANDUM IN HIS BREASTPOCKET HIS LEFTHAND ON THE RAIL OF THE BALCONY AND HIS RIGHT TRIFLING WITH HISEYEGLASS. THE STRIKING POINTS IN HIS APPEARANCE WERE HIS BUFFWAISTCOAT SHORTCLIPPED BLOND HAIR AND NEUTRAL PHYSIOGNOMY. HE BEGANWITH SOME CONFIDENCE.GENTLEMENELECTORS OF MIDDLEMARCHTHIS WAS SO MUCH THE RIGHT THING THAT A LITTLE PAUSE AFTER IT SEEMEDNATURAL.IM UNCOMMONLY GLAD TO BE HEREI WAS NEVER SO PROUD AND HAPPY IN MYLIFENEVER SO HAPPY YOU KNOW.THIS WAS A BOLD FIGURE OF SPEECH BUT NOT EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING FORUNHAPPILY THE PAT OPENING HAD SLIPPED AWAYEVEN COUPLETS FROM POPE MAYBE BUT FALLINGS FROM US VANISHINGS WHEN FEAR CLUTCHES US AND AGLASS OF SHERRY IS HURRYING LIKE SMOKE AMONG OUR IDEAS. LADISLAW WHOSTOOD AT THE WINDOW BEHIND THE SPEAKER THOUGHT ITS ALL UP NOW. THEONLY CHANCE IS THAT SINCE THE BEST THING WONT ALWAYS DO FLOUNDERINGMAY ANSWER FOR ONCE. MR. BROOKE MEANWHILE HAVING LOST OTHER CLEWSFELL BACK ON HIMSELF AND HIS QUALIFICATIONSALWAYS AN APPROPRIATEGRACEFUL SUBJECT FOR A CANDIDATE.I AM A CLOSE NEIGHBOR OF YOURS MY GOOD FRIENDSYOUVE KNOWN ME ON THEBENCH A GOOD WHILEIVE ALWAYS GONE A GOOD DEAL INTO PUBLICQUESTIONSMACHINERY NOW AND MACHINEBREAKINGYOURE MANY OF YOUCONCERNED WITH MACHINERY AND IVE BEEN GOING INTO THAT LATELY. ITWONT DO YOU KNOW BREAKING MACHINES EVERYTHING MUST GO ONTRADEMANUFACTURES COMMERCE INTERCHANGE OF STAPLESTHAT KIND OF THINGSINCEADAM SMITH THAT MUST GO ON. WE MUST LOOK ALL OVER THEGLOBEOBSERVATION WITH EXTENSIVE VIEW MUST LOOK EVERYWHERE FROMCHINA TO PERU AS SOMEBODY SAYSJOHNSON I THINK THE RAMBLER YOUKNOW. THAT IS WHAT I HAVE DONE UP TO A CERTAIN POINTNOT AS FAR ASPERU BUT IVE NOT ALWAYS STAYED AT HOMEI SAW IT WOULDNT DO. IVEBEEN IN THE LEVANT WHERE SOME OF YOUR MIDDLEMARCH GOODS GOAND THENAGAIN IN THE BALTIC. THE BALTIC NOW.PLYING AMONG HIS RECOLLECTIONS IN THIS WAY MR. BROOKE MIGHT HAVE GOTALONG EASILY TO HIMSELF AND WOULD HAVE COME BACK FROM THE REMOTESTSEAS WITHOUT TROUBLE BUT A DIABOLICAL PROCEDURE HAD BEEN SET UP BY THEENEMY. AT ONE AND THE SAME MOMENT THERE HAD RISEN ABOVE THE SHOULDERSOF THE CROWD NEARLY OPPOSITE MR. BROOKE AND WITHIN TEN YARDS OF HIMTHE EFFIGY OF HIMSELF BUFFCOLORED WAISTCOAT EYEGLASS AND NEUTRALPHYSIOGNOMY PAINTED ON RAG AND THERE HAD ARISEN APPARENTLY IN THEAIR LIKE THE NOTE OF THE CUCKOO A PARROTLIKE PUNCHVOICED ECHO OFHIS WORDS. EVERYBODY LOOKED UP AT THE OPEN WINDOWS IN THE HOUSES AT THEOPPOSITE ANGLES OF THE CONVERGING STREETS BUT THEY WERE EITHER BLANKOR FILLED BY LAUGHING LISTENERS. THE MOST INNOCENT ECHO HAS AN IMPISHMOCKERY IN IT WHEN IT FOLLOWS A GRAVELY PERSISTENT SPEAKER AND THISECHO WAS NOT AT ALL INNOCENT IF IT DID NOT FOLLOW WITH THE PRECISIONOF A NATURAL ECHO IT HAD A WICKED CHOICE OF THE WORDS IT OVERTOOK. BYTHE TIME IT SAID THE BALTIC NOW THE LAUGH WHICH HAD BEEN RUNNINGTHROUGH THE AUDIENCE BECAME A GENERAL SHOUT AND BUT FOR THE SOBERINGEFFECTS OF PARTY AND THAT GREAT PUBLIC CAUSE WHICH THE ENTANGLEMENT OFTHINGS HAD IDENTIFIED WITH BROOKE OF TIPTON THE LAUGH MIGHT HAVECAUGHT HIS COMMITTEE. MR. BULSTRODE ASKED REPREHENSIVELY WHAT THE NEWPOLICE WAS DOING BUT A VOICE COULD NOT WELL BE COLLARED AND AN ATTACKON THE EFFIGY OF THE CANDIDATE WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO EQUIVOCAL SINCEHAWLEY PROBABLY MEANT IT TO BE PELTED.MR. BROOKE HIMSELF WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO BE QUICKLY CONSCIOUS OFANYTHING EXCEPT A GENERAL SLIPPING AWAY OF IDEAS WITHIN HIMSELF HE HADEVEN A LITTLE SINGING IN THE EARS AND HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO HADNOT YET TAKEN DISTINCT ACCOUNT OF THE ECHO OR DISCERNED THE IMAGE OFHIMSELF. FEW THINGS HOLD THE PERCEPTIONS MORE THOROUGHLY CAPTIVE THANANXIETY ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE GOT TO SAY. MR. BROOKE HEARD THE LAUGHTERBUT HE HAD EXPECTED SOME TORY EFFORTS AT DISTURBANCE AND HE WAS ATTHIS MOMENT ADDITIONALLY EXCITED BY THE TICKLING STINGING SENSE THATHIS LOST EXORDIUM WAS COMING BACK TO FETCH HIM FROM THE BALTIC.THAT REMINDS ME HE WENT ON THRUSTING A HAND INTO HIS SIDEPOCKETWITH AN EASY AIR IF I WANTED A PRECEDENT YOU KNOWBUT WE NEVER WANTA PRECEDENT FOR THE RIGHT THINGBUT THERE IS CHATHAM NOW I CANT SAYI SHOULD HAVE SUPPORTED CHATHAM OR PITT THE YOUNGER PITTHE WAS NOT AMAN OF IDEAS AND WE WANT IDEAS YOU KNOW.BLAST YOUR IDEAS WE WANT THE BILL SAID A LOUD ROUGH VOICE FROM THECROWD BELOW.IMMEDIATELY THE INVISIBLE PUNCH WHO HAD HITHERTO FOLLOWED MR. BROOKEREPEATED BLAST YOUR IDEAS WE WANT THE BILL. THE LAUGH WAS LOUDERTHAN EVER AND FOR THE FIRST TIME MR. BROOKE BEING HIMSELF SILENTHEARD DISTINCTLY THE MOCKING ECHO. BUT IT SEEMED TO RIDICULE HISINTERRUPTER AND IN THAT LIGHT WAS ENCOURAGING SO HE REPLIED WITHAMENITYTHERE IS SOMETHING IN WHAT YOU SAY MY GOOD FRIEND AND WHAT DO WEMEET FOR BUT TO SPEAK OUR MINDSFREEDOM OF OPINION FREEDOM OF THEPRESS LIBERTYTHAT KIND OF THING THE BILL NOWYOU SHALL HAVE THEBILLHERE MR. BROOKE PAUSED A MOMENT TO FIX ON HIS EYEGLASS AND TAKETHE PAPER FROM HIS BREASTPOCKET WITH A SENSE OF BEING PRACTICAL ANDCOMING TO PARTICULARS. THE INVISIBLE PUNCH FOLLOWEDYOU SHALL HAVE THE BILL MR. BROOKE PER ELECTIONEERING CONTEST AND ASEAT OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT AS DELIVERED FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS SEVENSHILLINGS AND FOURPENCE.MR. BROOKE AMID THE ROARS OF LAUGHTER TURNED RED LET HIS EYEGLASSFALL AND LOOKING ABOUT HIM CONFUSEDLY SAW THE IMAGE OF HIMSELF WHICHHAD COME NEARER. THE NEXT MOMENT HE SAW IT DOLOROUSLY BESPATTERED WITHEGGS. HIS SPIRIT ROSE A LITTLE AND HIS VOICE TOO.BUFFOONERY TRICKS RIDICULE THE TEST OF TRUTHALL THAT IS VERYWELLHERE AN UNPLEASANT EGG BROKE ON MR. BROOKES SHOULDER AS THEECHO SAID ALL THAT IS VERY WELL THEN CAME A HAIL OF EGGS CHIEFLYAIMED AT THE IMAGE BUT OCCASIONALLY HITTING THE ORIGINAL AS IF BYCHANCE. THERE WAS A STREAM OF NEW MEN PUSHING AMONG THE CROWDWHISTLES YELLS BELLOWINGS AND FIFES MADE ALL THE GREATER HUBBUBBECAUSE THERE WAS SHOUTING AND STRUGGLING TO PUT THEM DOWN. NO VOICEWOULD HAVE HAD WING ENOUGH TO RISE ABOVE THE UPROAR AND MR. BROOKEDISAGREEABLY ANOINTED STOOD HIS GROUND NO LONGER. THE FRUSTRATIONWOULD HAVE BEEN LESS EXASPERATING IF IT HAD BEEN LESS GAMESOME ANDBOYISH A SERIOUS ASSAULT OF WHICH THE NEWSPAPER REPORTER CAN AVERTHAT IT ENDANGERED THE LEARNED GENTLEMANS RIBS OR CAN RESPECTFULLYBEAR WITNESS TO THE SOLES OF THAT GENTLEMANS BOOTS HAVING BEENVISIBLE ABOVE THE RAILING HAS PERHAPS MORE CONSOLATIONS ATTACHED TOIT.MR. BROOKE REENTERED THE COMMITTEEROOM SAYING AS CARELESSLY AS HECOULD THIS IS A LITTLE TOO BAD YOU KNOW. I SHOULD HAVE GOT THE EAROF THE PEOPLE BYANDBYBUT THEY DIDNT GIVE ME TIME. I SHOULD HAVEGONE INTO THE BILL BYANDBY YOU KNOW HE ADDED GLANCING ATLADISLAW. HOWEVER THINGS WILL COME ALL RIGHT AT THE NOMINATION.BUT IT WAS NOT RESOLVED UNANIMOUSLY THAT THINGS WOULD COME RIGHT ONTHE CONTRARY THE COMMITTEE LOOKED RATHER GRIM AND THE POLITICALPERSONAGE FROM BRASSING WAS WRITING BUSILY AS IF HE WERE BREWING NEWDEVICES.IT WAS BOWYER WHO DID IT SAID MR. STANDISH EVASIVELY. I KNOW IT ASWELL AS IF HE HAD BEEN ADVERTISED. HES UNCOMMONLY GOOD ATVENTRILOQUISM AND HE DID IT UNCOMMONLY WELL BY GOD HAWLEY HAS BEENHAVING HIM TO DINNER LATELY THERES A FUND OF TALENT IN BOWYER.WELL YOU KNOW YOU NEVER MENTIONED HIM TO ME STANDISH ELSE I WOULDHAVE INVITED HIM TO DINE SAID POOR MR. BROOKE WHO HAD GONE THROUGH AGREAT DEAL OF INVITING FOR THE GOOD OF HIS COUNTRY.THERES NOT A MORE PALTRY FELLOW IN MIDDLEMARCH THAN BOWYER SAIDLADISLAW INDIGNANTLY BUT IT SEEMS AS IF THE PALTRY FELLOWS WEREALWAYS TO TURN THE SCALE.WILL WAS THOROUGHLY OUT OF TEMPER WITH HIMSELF AS WELL AS WITH HISPRINCIPAL AND HE WENT TO SHUT HIMSELF IN HIS ROOMS WITH AHALFFORMED RESOLVE TO THROW UP THE PIONEER AND MR. BROOKE TOGETHER.WHY SHOULD HE STAY IF THE IMPASSABLE GULF BETWEEN HIMSELF AND DOROTHEAWERE EVER TO BE FILLED UP IT MUST RATHER BE BY HIS GOING AWAY ANDGETTING INTO A THOROUGHLY DIFFERENT POSITION THAN BY STAYING HERE ANDSLIPPING INTO DESERVED CONTEMPT AS AN UNDERSTRAPPER OF BROOKES. THENCAME THE YOUNG DREAM OF WONDERS THAT HE MIGHT DOIN FIVE YEARS FOREXAMPLE POLITICAL WRITING POLITICAL SPEAKING WOULD GET A HIGHERVALUE NOW PUBLIC LIFE WAS GOING TO BE WIDER AND MORE NATIONAL AND THEYMIGHT GIVE HIM SUCH DISTINCTION THAT HE WOULD NOT SEEM TO BE ASKINGDOROTHEA TO STEP DOWN TO HIM. FIVE YEARSIF HE COULD ONLY BE SURE THATSHE CARED FOR HIM MORE THAN FOR OTHERS IF HE COULD ONLY MAKE HER AWARETHAT HE STOOD ALOOF UNTIL HE COULD TELL HIS LOVE WITHOUT LOWERINGHIMSELFTHEN HE COULD GO AWAY EASILY AND BEGIN A CAREER WHICH ATFIVEANDTWENTY SEEMED PROBABLE ENOUGH IN THE INWARD ORDER OF THINGSWHERE TALENT BRINGS FAME AND FAME EVERYTHING ELSE WHICH IS DELIGHTFUL.HE COULD SPEAK AND HE COULD WRITE HE COULD MASTER ANY SUBJECT IF HECHOSE AND HE MEANT ALWAYS TO TAKE THE SIDE OF REASON AND JUSTICE ONWHICH HE WOULD CARRY ALL HIS ARDOR. WHY SHOULD HE NOT ONE DAY BE LIFTEDABOVE THE SHOULDERS OF THE CROWD AND FEEL THAT HE HAD WON THATEMINENCE WELL WITHOUT DOUBT HE WOULD LEAVE MIDDLEMARCH GO TO TOWNAND MAKE HIMSELF FIT FOR CELEBRITY BY EATING HIS DINNERS.BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY NOT UNTIL SOME KIND OF SIGN HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIMAND DOROTHEA. HE COULD NOT BE SATISFIED UNTIL SHE KNEW WHY EVEN IF HEWERE THE MAN SHE WOULD CHOOSE TO MARRY HE WOULD NOT MARRY HER. HENCEHE MUST KEEP HIS POST AND BEAR WITH MR. BROOKE A LITTLE LONGER.BUT HE SOON HAD REASON TO SUSPECT THAT MR. BROOKE HAD ANTICIPATED HIMIN THE WISH TO BREAK UP THEIR CONNECTION. DEPUTATIONS WITHOUT ANDVOICES WITHIN HAD CONCURRED IN INDUCING THAT PHILANTHROPIST TO TAKE ASTRONGER MEASURE THAN USUAL FOR THE GOOD OF MANKIND NAMELY TOWITHDRAW IN FAVOR OF ANOTHER CANDIDATE TO WHOM HE LEFT THE ADVANTAGESOF HIS CANVASSING MACHINERY. HE HIMSELF CALLED THIS A STRONG MEASUREBUT OBSERVED THAT HIS HEALTH WAS LESS CAPABLE OF SUSTAINING EXCITEMENTTHAN HE HAD IMAGINED.I HAVE FELT UNEASY ABOUT THE CHESTIT WONT DO TO CARRY THAT TOO FARHE SAID TO LADISLAW IN EXPLAINING THE AFFAIR. I MUST PULL UP. POORCASAUBON WAS A WARNING YOU KNOW. IVE MADE SOME HEAVY ADVANCES BUTIVE DUG A CHANNEL. ITS RATHER COARSE WORKTHIS ELECTIONEERING EHLADISLAW DARE SAY YOU ARE TIRED OF IT. HOWEVER WE HAVE DUG A CHANNELWITH THE PIONEERPUT THINGS IN A TRACK AND SO ON. A MORE ORDINARYMAN THAN YOU MIGHT CARRY IT ON NOWMORE ORDINARY YOU KNOW.DO YOU WISH ME TO GIVE IT UP SAID WILL THE QUICK COLOR COMING INHIS FACE AS HE ROSE FROM THE WRITINGTABLE AND TOOK A TURN OF THREESTEPS WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS. I AM READY TO DO SO WHENEVER YOUWISH IT.AS TO WISHING MY DEAR LADISLAW I HAVE THE HIGHEST OPINION OF YOURPOWERS YOU KNOW. BUT ABOUT THE PIONEER I HAVE BEEN CONSULTING ALITTLE WITH SOME OF THE MEN ON OUR SIDE AND THEY ARE INCLINED TO TAKEIT INTO THEIR HANDSINDEMNIFY ME TO A CERTAIN EXTENTCARRY IT ON INFACT. AND UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU MIGHT LIKE TO GIVE UPMIGHT FINDA BETTER FIELD. THESE PEOPLE MIGHT NOT TAKE THAT HIGH VIEW OF YOU WHICHI HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN AS AN ALTER EGO A RIGHT HANDTHOUGH I ALWAYSLOOKED FORWARD TO YOUR DOING SOMETHING ELSE. I THINK OF HAVING A RUNINTO FRANCE. BUT ILL WRITE YOU ANY LETTERS YOU KNOWTO ALTHORPE ANDPEOPLE OF THAT KIND. IVE MET ALTHORPE.I AM EXCEEDINGLY OBLIGED TO YOU SAID LADISLAW PROUDLY. SINCE YOUARE GOING TO PART WITH THE PIONEER I NEED NOT TROUBLE YOU ABOUT THESTEPS I SHALL TAKE. I MAY CHOOSE TO CONTINUE HERE FOR THE PRESENT.AFTER MR. BROOKE HAD LEFT HIM WILL SAID TO HIMSELF THE REST OF THEFAMILY HAVE BEEN URGING HIM TO GET RID OF ME AND HE DOESNT CARE NOWABOUT MY GOING. I SHALL STAY AS LONG AS I LIKE. I SHALL GO OF MY OWNMOVEMENTS AND NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF ME.CHAPTER LII.HIS HEARTTHE LOWLIEST DUTIES ON ITSELF DID LAY.WORDSWORTH.ON THAT JUNE EVENING WHEN MR. FAREBROTHER KNEW THAT HE WAS TO HAVE THELOWICK LIVING THERE WAS JOY IN THE OLD FASHIONED PARLOR AND EVEN THEPORTRAITS OF THE GREAT LAWYERS SEEMED TO LOOK ON WITH SATISFACTION. HISMOTHER LEFT HER TEA AND TOAST UNTOUCHED BUT SAT WITH HER USUAL PRETTYPRIMNESS ONLY SHOWING HER EMOTION BY THAT FLUSH IN THE CHEEKS ANDBRIGHTNESS IN THE EYES WHICH GIVE AN OLD WOMAN A TOUCHING MOMENTARYIDENTITY WITH HER FAROFF YOUTHFUL SELF AND SAYING DECISIVELYTHE GREATEST COMFORT CAMDEN IS THAT YOU HAVE DESERVED IT.WHEN A MAN GETS A GOOD BERTH MOTHER HALF THE DESERVING MUST COMEAFTER SAID THE SON BRIMFUL OF PLEASURE AND NOT TRYING TO CONCEALIT. THE GLADNESS IN HIS FACE WAS OF THAT ACTIVE KIND WHICH SEEMS TOHAVE ENERGY ENOUGH NOT ONLY TO FLASH OUTWARDLY BUT TO LIGHT UP BUSYVISION WITHIN ONE SEEMED TO SEE THOUGHTS AS WELL AS DELIGHT IN HISGLANCES.NOW AUNT HE WENT ON RUBBING HIS HANDS AND LOOKING AT MISS NOBLEWHO WAS MAKING TENDER LITTLE BEAVERLIKE NOISES THERE SHALL BESUGARCANDY ALWAYS ON THE TABLE FOR YOU TO STEAL AND GIVE TO THECHILDREN AND YOU SHALL HAVE A GREAT MANY NEW STOCKINGS TO MAKEPRESENTS OF AND YOU SHALL DARN YOUR OWN MORE THAN EVERMISS NOBLE NODDED AT HER NEPHEW WITH A SUBDUED HALFFRIGHTENED LAUGHCONSCIOUS OF HAVING ALREADY DROPPED AN ADDITIONAL LUMP OF SUGAR INTOHER BASKET ON THE STRENGTH OF THE NEW PREFERMENT.AS FOR YOU WINNYTHE VICAR WENT ONI SHALL MAKE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUTYOUR MARRYING ANY LOWICK BACHELORMR. SOLOMON FEATHERSTONE FOREXAMPLE AS SOON AS I FIND YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH HIM.MISS WINIFRED WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING AT HER BROTHER ALL THE WHILE ANDCRYING HEARTILY WHICH WAS HER WAY OF REJOICING SMILED THROUGH HERTEARS AND SAID YOU MUST SET ME THE EXAMPLE CAM YOU MUST MARRYNOW.WITH ALL MY HEART. BUT WHO IS IN LOVE WITH ME I AM A SEEDY OLDFELLOW SAID THE VICAR RISING PUSHING HIS CHAIR AWAY AND LOOKINGDOWN AT HIMSELF. WHAT DO YOU SAY MOTHERYOU ARE A HANDSOME MAN CAMDEN THOUGH NOT SO FINE A FIGURE OF A MANAS YOUR FATHER SAID THE OLD LADY.I WISH YOU WOULD MARRY MISS GARTH BROTHER SAID MISS WINIFRED. SHEWOULD MAKE US SO LIVELY AT LOWICK.VERY FINE YOU TALK AS IF YOUNG WOMEN WERE TIED UP TO BE CHOSEN LIKEPOULTRY AT MARKET AS IF I HAD ONLY TO ASK AND EVERYBODY WOULD HAVEME SAID THE VICAR NOT CARING TO SPECIFY.WE DONT WANT EVERYBODY SAID MISS WINIFRED. BUT YOU WOULD LIKEMISS GARTH MOTHER SHOULDNT YOUMY SONS CHOICE SHALL BE MINE SAID MRS. FAREBROTHER WITH MAJESTICDISCRETION AND A WIFE WOULD BE MOST WELCOME CAMDEN. YOU WILL WANTYOUR WHIST AT HOME WHEN WE GO TO LOWICK AND HENRIETTA NOBLE NEVER WASA WHISTPLAYER. MRS. FAREBROTHER ALWAYS CALLED HER TINY OLD SISTER BYTHAT MAGNIFICENT NAME.I SHALL DO WITHOUT WHIST NOW MOTHER.WHY SO CAMDEN IN MY TIME WHIST WAS THOUGHT AN UNDENIABLE AMUSEMENTFOR A GOOD CHURCHMAN SAID MRS. FAREBROTHER INNOCENT OF THE MEANINGTHAT WHIST HAD FOR HER SON AND SPEAKING RATHER SHARPLY AS AT SOMEDANGEROUS COUNTENANCING OF NEW DOCTRINE.I SHALL BE TOO BUSY FOR WHIST I SHALL HAVE TWO PARISHES SAID THEVICAR PREFERRING NOT TO DISCUSS THE VIRTUES OF THAT GAME.HE HAD ALREADY SAID TO DOROTHEA I DONT FEEL BOUND TO GIVE UP ST.BOTOLPHS. IT IS PROTEST ENOUGH AGAINST THE PLURALISM THEY WANT TOREFORM IF I GIVE SOMEBODY ELSE MOST OF THE MONEY. THE STRONGER THING ISNOT TO GIVE UP POWER BUT TO USE IT WELL.I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT SAID DOROTHEA. SO FAR AS SELF IS CONCERNEDI THINK IT WOULD BE EASIER TO GIVE UP POWER AND MONEY THAN TO KEEPTHEM. IT SEEMS VERY UNFITTING THAT I SHOULD HAVE THIS PATRONAGE YET IFELT THAT I OUGHT NOT TO LET IT BE USED BY SOME ONE ELSE INSTEAD OFME.IT IS I WHO AM BOUND TO ACT SO THAT YOU WILL NOT REGRET YOUR POWERSAID MR. FAREBROTHER.HIS WAS ONE OF THE NATURES IN WHICH CONSCIENCE GETS THE MORE ACTIVEWHEN THE YOKE OF LIFE CEASES TO GALL THEM. HE MADE NO DISPLAY OFHUMILITY ON THE SUBJECT BUT IN HIS HEART HE FELT RATHER ASHAMED THATHIS CONDUCT HAD SHOWN LACHES WHICH OTHERS WHO DID NOT GET BENEFICESWERE FREE FROM.I USED OFTEN TO WISH I HAD BEEN SOMETHING ELSE THAN A CLERGYMAN HESAID TO LYDGATE BUT PERHAPS IT WILL BE BETTER TO TRY AND MAKE AS GOODA CLERGYMAN OUT OF MYSELF AS I CAN. THAT IS THE WELLBENEFICED POINT OFVIEW YOU PERCEIVE FROM WHICH DIFFICULTIES ARE MUCH SIMPLIFIED HEENDED SMILING.THE VICAR DID FEEL THEN AS IF HIS SHARE OF DUTIES WOULD BE EASY. BUTDUTY HAS A TRICK OF BEHAVING UNEXPECTEDLYSOMETHING LIKE A HEAVY FRIENDWHOM WE HAVE AMIABLY ASKED TO VISIT US AND WHO BREAKS HIS LEG WITHINOUR GATES.HARDLY A WEEK LATER DUTY PRESENTED ITSELF IN HIS STUDY UNDER THEDISGUISE OF FRED VINCY NOW RETURNED FROM OMNIBUS COLLEGE WITH HISBACHELORS DEGREE.I AM ASHAMED TO TROUBLE YOU MR. FAREBROTHER SAID FRED WHOSE FAIROPEN FACE WAS PROPITIATING BUT YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I CAN CONSULT.I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING ONCE BEFORE AND YOU WERE SO GOOD THAT I CANTHELP COMING TO YOU AGAIN.SIT DOWN FRED IM READY TO HEAR AND DO ANYTHING I CAN SAID THEVICAR WHO WAS BUSY PACKING SOME SMALL OBJECTS FOR REMOVAL AND WENT ONWITH HIS WORK.I WANTED TO TELL YOU FRED HESITATED AN INSTANT AND THEN WENT ONPLUNGINGLY I MIGHT GO INTO THE CHURCH NOW AND REALLY LOOK WHERE IMAY I CANT SEE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO. I DONT LIKE IT BUT I KNOW ITSUNCOMMONLY HARD ON MY FATHER TO SAY SO AFTER HE HAS SPENT A GOOD DEALOF MONEY IN EDUCATING ME FOR IT. FRED PAUSED AGAIN AN INSTANT ANDTHEN REPEATED AND I CANT SEE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO.I DID TALK TO YOUR FATHER ABOUT IT FRED BUT I MADE LITTLE WAY WITHHIM. HE SAID IT WAS TOO LATE. BUT YOU HAVE GOT OVER ONE BRIDGE NOWWHAT ARE YOUR OTHER DIFFICULTIESMERELY THAT I DONT LIKE IT. I DONT LIKE DIVINITY AND PREACHING ANDFEELING OBLIGED TO LOOK SERIOUS. I LIKE RIDING ACROSS COUNTRY ANDDOING AS OTHER MEN DO. I DONT MEAN THAT I WANT TO BE A BAD FELLOW INANY WAY BUT IVE NO TASTE FOR THE SORT OF THING PEOPLE EXPECT OF ACLERGYMAN. AND YET WHAT ELSE AM I TO DO MY FATHER CANT SPARE ME ANYCAPITAL ELSE I MIGHT GO INTO FARMING. AND HE HAS NO ROOM FOR ME IN HISTRADE. AND OF COURSE I CANT BEGIN TO STUDY FOR LAW OR PHYSIC NOW WHENMY FATHER WANTS ME TO EARN SOMETHING. ITS ALL VERY WELL TO SAY IMWRONG TO GO INTO THE CHURCH BUT THOSE WHO SAY SO MIGHT AS WELL TELL METO GO INTO THE BACKWOODS.FREDS VOICE HAD TAKEN A TONE OF GRUMBLING REMONSTRANCE AND MR.FAREBROTHER MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCLINED TO SMILE IF HIS MIND HAD NOT BEENTOO BUSY IN IMAGINING MORE THAN FRED TOLD HIM.HAVE YOU ANY DIFFICULTIES ABOUT DOCTRINESABOUT THE ARTICLES HESAID TRYING HARD TO THINK OF THE QUESTION SIMPLY FOR FREDS SAKE.NO I SUPPOSE THE ARTICLES ARE RIGHT. I AM NOT PREPARED WITH ANYARGUMENTS TO DISPROVE THEM AND MUCH BETTER CLEVERER FELLOWS THAN I AMGO IN FOR THEM ENTIRELY. I THINK IT WOULD BE RATHER RIDICULOUS IN ME TOURGE SCRUPLES OF THAT SORT AS IF I WERE A JUDGE SAID FRED QUITESIMPLY.I SUPPOSE THEN IT HAS OCCURRED TO YOU THAT YOU MIGHT BE A FAIRPARISH PRIEST WITHOUT BEING MUCH OF A DIVINEOF COURSE IF I AM OBLIGED TO BE A CLERGYMAN I SHALL TRY AND DO MYDUTY THOUGH I MAYNT LIKE IT. DO YOU THINK ANY BODY OUGHT TO BLAMEMEFOR GOING INTO THE CHURCH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DEPENDS ONYOUR CONSCIENCE FREDHOW FAR YOU HAVE COUNTED THE COST AND SEEN WHATYOUR POSITION WILL REQUIRE OF YOU. I CAN ONLY TELL YOU ABOUT MYSELFTHAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TOO LAX AND HAVE BEEN UNEASY IN CONSEQUENCE.BUT THERE IS ANOTHER HINDRANCE SAID FRED COLORING. I DID NOT TELLYOU BEFORE THOUGH PERHAPS I MAY HAVE SAID THINGS THAT MADE YOU GUESSIT. THERE IS SOMEBODY I AM VERY FOND OF I HAVE LOVED HER EVER SINCE WEWERE CHILDREN.MISS GARTH I SUPPOSE SAID THE VICAR EXAMINING SOME LABELS VERYCLOSELY.YES. I SHOULDNT MIND ANYTHING IF SHE WOULD HAVE ME. AND I KNOW ICOULD BE A GOOD FELLOW THEN.AND YOU THINK SHE RETURNS THE FEELINGSHE NEVER WILL SAY SO AND A GOOD WHILE AGO SHE MADE ME PROMISE NOT TOSPEAK TO HER ABOUT IT AGAIN. AND SHE HAS SET HER MIND ESPECIALLYAGAINST MY BEING A CLERGYMAN I KNOW THAT. BUT I CANT GIVE HER UP. IDO THINK SHE CARES ABOUT ME. I SAW MRS. GARTH LAST NIGHT AND SHE SAIDTHAT MARY WAS STAYING AT LOWICK RECTORY WITH MISS FAREBROTHER.YES SHE IS VERY KINDLY HELPING MY SISTER. DO YOU WISH TO GO THERENO I WANT TO ASK A GREAT FAVOR OF YOU. I AM ASHAMED TO BOTHER YOU INTHIS WAY BUT MARY MIGHT LISTEN TO WHAT YOU SAID IF YOU MENTIONED THESUBJECT TO HERI MEAN ABOUT MY GOING INTO THE CHURCH.THAT IS RATHER A DELICATE TASK MY DEAR FRED. I SHALL HAVE TOPRESUPPOSE YOUR ATTACHMENT TO HER AND TO ENTER ON THE SUBJECT AS YOUWISH ME TO DO WILL BE ASKING HER TO TELL ME WHETHER SHE RETURNS IT.THAT IS WHAT I WANT HER TO TELL YOU SAID FRED BLUNTLY. I DONTKNOW WHAT TO DO UNLESS I CAN GET AT HER FEELING.YOU MEAN THAT YOU WOULD BE GUIDED BY THAT AS TO YOUR GOING INTO THECHURCHIF MARY SAID SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE ME I MIGHT AS WELL GO WRONG IN ONEWAY AS ANOTHER.THAT IS NONSENSE FRED. MEN OUTLIVE THEIR LOVE BUT THEY DONT OUTLIVETHE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR RECKLESSNESS.NOT MY SORT OF LOVE I HAVE NEVER BEEN WITHOUT LOVING MARY. IF I HADTO GIVE HER UP IT WOULD BE LIKE BEGINNING TO LIVE ON WOODEN LEGS.WILL SHE NOT BE HURT AT MY INTRUSIONNO I FEEL SURE SHE WILL NOT. SHE RESPECTS YOU MORE THAN ANY ONE ANDSHE WOULD NOT PUT YOU OFF WITH FUN AS SHE DOES ME. OF COURSE I COULDNOT HAVE TOLD ANY ONE ELSE OR ASKED ANY ONE ELSE TO SPEAK TO HER BUTYOU. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WHO COULD BE SUCH A FRIEND TO BOTH OF US.FRED PAUSED A MOMENT AND THEN SAID RATHER COMPLAININGLY AND SHEOUGHT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE WORKED IN ORDER TO PASS. SHE OUGHT TOBELIEVE THAT I WOULD EXERT MYSELF FOR HER SAKE.THERE WAS A MOMENTS SILENCE BEFORE MR. FAREBROTHER LAID DOWN HIS WORKAND PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO FRED SAIDVERY WELL MY BOY. I WILL DO WHAT YOU WISH.THAT VERY DAY MR. FAREBROTHER WENT TO LOWICK PARSONAGE ON THE NAG WHICHHE HAD JUST SET UP. DECIDEDLY I AM AN OLD STALK HE THOUGHT THEYOUNG GROWTHS ARE PUSHING ME ASIDE.HE FOUND MARY IN THE GARDEN GATHERING ROSES AND SPRINKLING THE PETALSON A SHEET. THE SUN WAS LOW AND TALL TREES SENT THEIR SHADOWS ACROSSTHE GRASSY WALKS WHERE MARY WAS MOVING WITHOUT BONNET OR PARASOL. SHEDID NOT OBSERVE MR. FAREBROTHERS APPROACH ALONG THE GRASS AND HADJUST STOOPED DOWN TO LECTURE A SMALL BLACKANDTAN TERRIER WHICH WOULDPERSIST IN WALKING ON THE SHEET AND SMELLING AT THE ROSELEAVES AS MARYSPRINKLED THEM. SHE TOOK HIS FOREPAWS IN ONE HAND AND LIFTED UP THEFOREFINGER OF THE OTHER WHILE THE DOG WRINKLED HIS BROWS AND LOOKEDEMBARRASSED. FLY FLY I AM ASHAMED OF YOU MARY WAS SAYING IN AGRAVE CONTRALTO. THIS IS NOT BECOMING IN A SENSIBLE DOG ANYBODY WOULDTHINK YOU WERE A SILLY YOUNG GENTLEMAN.YOU ARE UNMERCIFUL TO YOUNG GENTLEMEN MISS GARTH SAID THE VICARWITHIN TWO YARDS OF HER.MARY STARTED UP AND BLUSHED. IT ALWAYS ANSWERS TO REASON WITH FLYSHE SAID LAUGHINGLY.BUT NOT WITH YOUNG GENTLEMENOH WITH SOME I SUPPOSE SINCE SOME OF THEM TURN INTO EXCELLENT MEN.I AM GLAD OF THAT ADMISSION BECAUSE I WANT AT THIS VERY MOMENT TOINTEREST YOU IN A YOUNG GENTLEMAN.NOT A SILLY ONE I HOPE SAID MARY BEGINNING TO PLUCK THE ROSESAGAIN AND FEELING HER HEART BEAT UNCOMFORTABLY.NO THOUGH PERHAPS WISDOM IS NOT HIS STRONG POINT BUT RATHERAFFECTION AND SINCERITY. HOWEVER WISDOM LIES MORE IN THOSE TWOQUALITIES THAN PEOPLE ARE APT TO IMAGINE. I HOPE YOU KNOW BY THOSEMARKS WHAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN I MEAN.YES I THINK I DO SAID MARY BRAVELY HER FACE GETTING MORE SERIOUSAND HER HANDS COLD IT MUST BE FRED VINCY.HE HAS ASKED ME TO CONSULT YOU ABOUT HIS GOING INTO THE CHURCH. I HOPEYOU WILL NOT THINK THAT I CONSENTED TO TAKE A LIBERTY IN PROMISING TODO SO.ON THE CONTRARY MR. FAREBROTHER SAID MARY GIVING UP THE ROSES ANDFOLDING HER ARMS BUT UNABLE TO LOOK UP WHENEVER YOU HAVE ANYTHING TOSAY TO ME I FEEL HONORED.BUT BEFORE I ENTER ON THAT QUESTION LET ME JUST TOUCH A POINT ONWHICH YOUR FATHER TOOK ME INTO CONFIDENCE BY THE WAY IT WAS THAT VERYEVENING ON WHICH I ONCE BEFORE FULFILLED A MISSION FROM FRED JUSTAFTER HE HAD GONE TO COLLEGE. MR. GARTH TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED ON THENIGHT OF FEATHERSTONES DEATHHOW YOU REFUSED TO BURN THE WILL AND HESAID THAT YOU HAD SOME HEARTPRICKINGS ON THAT SUBJECT BECAUSE YOU HADBEEN THE INNOCENT MEANS OF HINDERING FRED FROM GETTING HIS TEN THOUSANDPOUNDS. I HAVE KEPT THAT IN MIND AND I HAVE HEARD SOMETHING THAT MAYRELIEVE YOU ON THAT SCOREMAY SHOW YOU THAT NO SINOFFERING IS DEMANDEDFROM YOU THERE.MR. FAREBROTHER PAUSED A MOMENT AND LOOKED AT MARY. HE MEANT TO GIVEFRED HIS FULL ADVANTAGE BUT IT WOULD BE WELL HE THOUGHT TO CLEAR HERMIND OF ANY SUPERSTITIONS SUCH AS WOMEN SOMETIMES FOLLOW WHEN THEY DOA MAN THE WRONG OF MARRYING HIM AS AN ACT OF ATONEMENT. MARYS CHEEKSHAD BEGUN TO BURN A LITTLE AND SHE WAS MUTE.I MEAN THAT YOUR ACTION MADE NO REAL DIFFERENCE TO FREDS LOT. I FINDTHAT THE FIRST WILL WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LEGALLY GOOD AFTER THE BURNINGOF THE LAST IT WOULD NOT HAVE STOOD IF IT HAD BEEN DISPUTED AND YOUMAY BE SURE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISPUTED. SO ON THAT SCORE YOU MAYFEEL YOUR MIND FREE.THANK YOU MR. FAREBROTHER SAID MARY EARNESTLY. I AM GRATEFUL TOYOU FOR REMEMBERING MY FEELINGS.WELL NOW I MAY GO ON. FRED YOU KNOW HAS TAKEN HIS DEGREE. HE HASWORKED HIS WAY SO FAR AND NOW THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS HE TO DO THATQUESTION IS SO DIFFICULT THAT HE IS INCLINED TO FOLLOW HIS FATHERSWISHES AND ENTER THE CHURCH THOUGH YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I DO THAT HEWAS QUITE SET AGAINST THAT FORMERLY. I HAVE QUESTIONED HIM ON THESUBJECT AND I CONFESS I SEE NO INSUPERABLE OBJECTION TO HIS BEING ACLERGYMAN AS THINGS GO. HE SAYS THAT HE COULD TURN HIS MIND TO DOINGHIS BEST IN THAT VOCATION ON ONE CONDITION. IF THAT CONDITION WEREFULFILLED I WOULD DO MY UTMOST IN HELPING FRED ON. AFTER A TIMENOT OFCOURSE AT FIRSTHE MIGHT BE WITH ME AS MY CURATE AND HE WOULD HAVE SOMUCH TO DO THAT HIS STIPEND WOULD BE NEARLY WHAT I USED TO GET ASVICAR. BUT I REPEAT THAT THERE IS A CONDITION WITHOUT WHICH ALL THISGOOD CANNOT COME TO PASS. HE HAS OPENED HIS HEART TO ME MISS GARTHAND ASKED ME TO PLEAD FOR HIM. THE CONDITION LIES ENTIRELY IN YOURFEELING.MARY LOOKED SO MUCH MOVED THAT HE SAID AFTER A MOMENT LET US WALK ALITTLE AND WHEN THEY WERE WALKING HE ADDED TO SPEAK QUITE PLAINLYFRED WILL NOT TAKE ANY COURSE WHICH WOULD LESSEN THE CHANCE THAT YOUWOULD CONSENT TO BE HIS WIFE BUT WITH THAT PROSPECT HE WILL TRY HISBEST AT ANYTHING YOU APPROVE.I CANNOT POSSIBLY SAY THAT I WILL EVER BE HIS WIFE MR. FAREBROTHERBUT I CERTAINLY NEVER WILL BE HIS WIFE IF HE BECOMES A CLERGYMAN. WHATYOU SAY IS MOST GENEROUS AND KIND I DONT MEAN FOR A MOMENT TO CORRECTYOUR JUDGMENT. IT IS ONLY THAT I HAVE MY GIRLISH MOCKING WAY OFLOOKING AT THINGS SAID MARY WITH A RETURNING SPARKLE OF PLAYFULNESSIN HER ANSWER WHICH ONLY MADE ITS MODESTY MORE CHARMING.HE WISHES ME TO REPORT EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK SAID MR. FAREBROTHER.I COULD NOT LOVE A MAN WHO IS RIDICULOUS SAID MARY NOT CHOOSING TOGO DEEPER. FRED HAS SENSE AND KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH TO MAKE HIMRESPECTABLE IF HE LIKES IN SOME GOOD WORLDLY BUSINESS BUT I CANNEVER IMAGINE HIM PREACHING AND EXHORTING AND PRONOUNCING BLESSINGSAND PRAYING BY THE SICK WITHOUT FEELING AS IF I WERE LOOKING AT ACARICATURE. HIS BEING A CLERGYMAN WOULD BE ONLY FOR GENTILITYS SAKEAND I THINK THERE IS NOTHING MORE CONTEMPTIBLE THAN SUCH IMBECILEGENTILITY. I USED TO THINK THAT OF MR. CROWSE WITH HIS EMPTY FACE ANDNEAT UMBRELLA AND MINCING LITTLE SPEECHES. WHAT RIGHT HAVE SUCH MEN TOREPRESENT CHRISTIANITYAS IF IT WERE AN INSTITUTION FOR GETTING UPIDIOTS GENTEELLYAS IF MARY CHECKED HERSELF. SHE HAD BEEN CARRIEDALONG AS IF SHE HAD BEEN SPEAKING TO FRED INSTEAD OF MR. FAREBROTHER.YOUNG WOMEN ARE SEVERE THEY DONT FEEL THE STRESS OF ACTION AS MENDO THOUGH PERHAPS I OUGHT TO MAKE YOU AN EXCEPTION THERE. BUT YOUDONT PUT FRED VINCY ON SO LOW A LEVEL AS THATNO INDEED HE HAS PLENTY OF SENSE BUT I THINK HE WOULD NOT SHOW ITAS A CLERGYMAN. HE WOULD BE A PIECE OF PROFESSIONAL AFFECTATION.THEN THE ANSWER IS QUITE DECIDED. AS A CLERGYMAN HE COULD HAVE NOHOPEMARY SHOOK HER HEAD.BUT IF HE BRAVED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES OF GETTING HIS BREAD IN SOMEOTHER WAYWILL YOU GIVE HIM THE SUPPORT OF HOPE MAY HE COUNT ONWINNING YOUI THINK FRED OUGHT NOT TO NEED TELLING AGAIN WHAT I HAVE ALREADY SAIDTO HIM MARY ANSWERED WITH A SLIGHT RESENTMENT IN HER MANNER. I MEANTHAT HE OUGHT NOT TO PUT SUCH QUESTIONS UNTIL HE HAS DONE SOMETHINGWORTHY INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT HE COULD DO IT.MR. FAREBROTHER WAS SILENT FOR A MINUTE OR MORE AND THEN AS THEYTURNED AND PAUSED UNDER THE SHADOW OF A MAPLE AT THE END OF A GRASSYWALK SAID I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU RESIST ANY ATTEMPT TO FETTER YOUBUT EITHER YOUR FEELING FOR FRED VINCY EXCLUDES YOUR ENTERTAININGANOTHER ATTACHMENT OR IT DOES NOT EITHER HE MAY COUNT ON YOURREMAINING SINGLE UNTIL HE SHALL HAVE EARNED YOUR HAND OR HE MAY IN ANYCASE BE DISAPPOINTED. PARDON ME MARYYOU KNOW I USED TO CATECHISE YOUUNDER THAT NAMEBUT WHEN THE STATE OF A WOMANS AFFECTIONS TOUCHES THEHAPPINESS OF ANOTHER LIFEOF MORE LIVES THAN ONEI THINK IT WOULD BETHE NOBLER COURSE FOR HER TO BE PERFECTLY DIRECT AND OPEN.MARY IN HER TURN WAS SILENT WONDERING NOT AT MR. FAREBROTHERS MANNERBUT AT HIS TONE WHICH HAD A GRAVE RESTRAINED EMOTION IN IT. WHEN THESTRANGE IDEA FLASHED ACROSS HER THAT HIS WORDS HAD REFERENCE TOHIMSELF SHE WAS INCREDULOUS AND ASHAMED OF ENTERTAINING IT. SHE HADNEVER THOUGHT THAT ANY MAN COULD LOVE HER EXCEPT FRED WHO HAD ESPOUSEDHER WITH THE UMBRELLA RING WHEN SHE WORE SOCKS AND LITTLE STRAPPEDSHOES STILL LESS THAT SHE COULD BE OF ANY IMPORTANCE TO MR.FAREBROTHER THE CLEVEREST MAN IN HER NARROW CIRCLE. SHE HAD ONLY TIMETO FEEL THAT ALL THIS WAS HAZY AND PERHAPS ILLUSORY BUT ONE THING WASCLEAR AND DETERMINEDHER ANSWER.SINCE YOU THINK IT MY DUTY MR. FAREBROTHER I WILL TELL YOU THAT IHAVE TOO STRONG A FEELING FOR FRED TO GIVE HIM UP FOR ANY ONE ELSE. ISHOULD NEVER BE QUITE HAPPY IF I THOUGHT HE WAS UNHAPPY FOR THE LOSS OFME. IT HAS TAKEN SUCH DEEP ROOT IN MEMY GRATITUDE TO HIM FOR ALWAYSLOVING ME BEST AND MINDING SO MUCH IF I HURT MYSELF FROM THE TIMEWHEN WE WERE VERY LITTLE. I CANNOT IMAGINE ANY NEW FEELING COMING TOMAKE THAT WEAKER. I SHOULD LIKE BETTER THAN ANYTHING TO SEE HIM WORTHYOF EVERY ONES RESPECT. BUT PLEASE TELL HIM I WILL NOT PROMISE TO MARRYHIM TILL THEN I SHOULD SHAME AND GRIEVE MY FATHER AND MOTHER. HE ISFREE TO CHOOSE SOME ONE ELSE.THEN I HAVE FULFILLED MY COMMISSION THOROUGHLY SAID MR. FAREBROTHERPUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO MARY AND I SHALL RIDE BACK TO MIDDLEMARCHFORTHWITH. WITH THIS PROSPECT BEFORE HIM WE SHALL GET FRED INTO THERIGHT NICHE SOMEHOW AND I HOPE I SHALL LIVE TO JOIN YOUR HANDS. GODBLESS YOUOH PLEASE STAY AND LET ME GIVE YOU SOME TEA SAID MARY. HER EYESFILLED WITH TEARS FOR SOMETHING INDEFINABLE SOMETHING LIKE THERESOLUTE SUPPRESSION OF A PAIN IN MR. FAREBROTHERS MANNER MADE HERFEEL SUDDENLY MISERABLE AS SHE HAD ONCE FELT WHEN SHE SAW HER FATHERSHANDS TREMBLING IN A MOMENT OF TROUBLE.NO MY DEAR NO. I MUST GET BACK.IN THREE MINUTES THE VICAR WAS ON HORSEBACK AGAIN HAVING GONEMAGNANIMOUSLY THROUGH A DUTY MUCH HARDER THAN THE RENUNCIATION OFWHIST OR EVEN THAN THE WRITING OF PENITENTIAL MEDITATIONS.CHAPTER LIII.IT IS BUT A SHALLOW HASTE WHICH CONCLUDETH INSINCERITY FROM WHATOUTSIDERS CALL INCONSISTENCYPUTTING A DEAD MECHANISM OF IFS ANDTHEREFORES FOR THE LIVING MYRIAD OF HIDDEN SUCKERS WHEREBY THE BELIEFAND THE CONDUCT ARE WROUGHT INTO MUTUAL SUSTAINMENT.MR. BULSTRODE WHEN HE WAS HOPING TO ACQUIRE A NEW INTEREST IN LOWICKHAD NATURALLY HAD AN ESPECIAL WISH THAT THE NEW CLERGYMAN SHOULD BE ONEWHOM HE THOROUGHLY APPROVED AND HE BELIEVED IT TO BE A CHASTISEMENTAND ADMONITION DIRECTED TO HIS OWN SHORTCOMINGS AND THOSE OF THE NATIONAT LARGE THAT JUST ABOUT THE TIME WHEN HE CAME IN POSSESSION OF THEDEEDS WHICH MADE HIM THE PROPRIETOR OF STONE COURT MR. FAREBROTHERREAD HIMSELF INTO THE QUAINT LITTLE CHURCH AND PREACHED HIS FIRSTSERMON TO THE CONGREGATION OF FARMERS LABORERS AND VILLAGE ARTISANS.IT WAS NOT THAT MR. BULSTRODE INTENDED TO FREQUENT LOWICK CHURCH OR TORESIDE AT STONE COURT FOR A GOOD WHILE TO COME HE HAD BOUGHT THEEXCELLENT FARM AND FINE HOMESTEAD SIMPLY AS A RETREAT WHICH HE MIGHTGRADUALLY ENLARGE AS TO THE LAND AND BEAUTIFY AS TO THE DWELLING UNTILIT SHOULD BE CONDUCIVE TO THE DIVINE GLORY THAT HE SHOULD ENTER ON ITAS A RESIDENCE PARTIALLY WITHDRAWING FROM HIS PRESENT EXERTIONS IN THEADMINISTRATION OF BUSINESS AND THROWING MORE CONSPICUOUSLY ON THE SIDEOF GOSPEL TRUTH THE WEIGHT OF LOCAL LANDED PROPRIETORSHIP WHICHPROVIDENCE MIGHT INCREASE BY UNFORESEEN OCCASIONS OF PURCHASE. A STRONGLEADING IN THIS DIRECTION SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN IN THE SURPRISINGFACILITY OF GETTING STONE COURT WHEN EVERY ONE HAD EXPECTED THAT MR.RIGG FEATHERSTONE WOULD HAVE CLUNG TO IT AS THE GARDEN OF EDEN. THATWAS WHAT POOR OLD PETER HIMSELF HAD EXPECTED HAVING OFTEN INIMAGINATION LOOKED UP THROUGH THE SODS ABOVE HIM AND UNOBSTRUCTED BYPERSPECTIVE SEEN HIS FROGFACED LEGATEE ENJOYING THE FINE OLD PLACE TOTHE PERPETUAL SURPRISE AND DISAPPOINTMENT OF OTHER SURVIVORS.BUT HOW LITTLE WE KNOW WHAT WOULD MAKE PARADISE FOR OUR NEIGHBORS WEJUDGE FROM OUR OWN DESIRES AND OUR NEIGHBORS THEMSELVES ARE NOT ALWAYSOPEN ENOUGH EVEN TO THROW OUT A HINT OF THEIRS. THE COOL AND JUDICIOUSJOSHUA RIGG HAD NOT ALLOWED HIS PARENT TO PERCEIVE THAT STONE COURT WASANYTHING LESS THAN THE CHIEF GOOD IN HIS ESTIMATION AND HE HADCERTAINLY WISHED TO CALL IT HIS OWN. BUT AS WARREN HASTINGS LOOKED ATGOLD AND THOUGHT OF BUYING DAYLESFORD SO JOSHUA RIGG LOOKED AT STONECOURT AND THOUGHT OF BUYING GOLD. HE HAD A VERY DISTINCT AND INTENSEVISION OF HIS CHIEF GOOD THE VIGOROUS GREED WHICH HE HAD INHERITEDHAVING TAKEN A SPECIAL FORM BY DINT OF CIRCUMSTANCE AND HIS CHIEF GOODWAS TO BE A MONEYCHANGER. FROM HIS EARLIEST EMPLOYMENT AS AN ERRANDBOYIN A SEAPORT HE HAD LOOKED THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE MONEYCHANGERS ASOTHER BOYS LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE PASTRYCOOKS THEFASCINATION HAD WROUGHT ITSELF GRADUALLY INTO A DEEP SPECIAL PASSIONHE MEANT WHEN HE HAD PROPERTY TO DO MANY THINGS ONE OF THEM BEING TOMARRY A GENTEEL YOUNG PERSON BUT THESE WERE ALL ACCIDENTS AND JOYSTHAT IMAGINATION COULD DISPENSE WITH. THE ONE JOY AFTER WHICH HIS SOULTHIRSTED WAS TO HAVE A MONEYCHANGERS SHOP ON A MUCHFREQUENTED QUAYTO HAVE LOCKS ALL ROUND HIM OF WHICH HE HELD THE KEYS AND TO LOOKSUBLIMELY COOL AS HE HANDLED THE BREEDING COINS OF ALL NATIONS WHILEHELPLESS CUPIDITY LOOKED AT HIM ENVIOUSLY FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF ANIRON LATTICE. THE STRENGTH OF THAT PASSION HAD BEEN A POWER ENABLINGHIM TO MASTER ALL THE KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY TO GRATIFY IT. AND WHENOTHERS WERE THINKING THAT HE HAD SETTLED AT STONE COURT FOR LIFEJOSHUA HIMSELF WAS THINKING THAT THE MOMENT NOW WAS NOT FAR OFF WHEN HESHOULD SETTLE ON THE NORTH QUAY WITH THE BEST APPOINTMENTS IN SAFES ANDLOCKS.ENOUGH. WE ARE CONCERNED WITH LOOKING AT JOSHUA RIGGS SALE OF HIS LANDFROM MR. BULSTRODES POINT OF VIEW AND HE INTERPRETED IT AS A CHEERINGDISPENSATION CONVEYING PERHAPS A SANCTION TO A PURPOSE WHICH HE HAD FORSOME TIME ENTERTAINED WITHOUT EXTERNAL ENCOURAGEMENT HE INTERPRETED ITTHUS BUT NOT TOO CONFIDENTLY OFFERING UP HIS THANKSGIVING IN GUARDEDPHRASEOLOGY. HIS DOUBTS DID NOT ARISE FROM THE POSSIBLE RELATIONS OFTHE EVENT TO JOSHUA RIGGS DESTINY WHICH BELONGED TO THE UNMAPPEDREGIONS NOT TAKEN UNDER THE PROVIDENTIAL GOVERNMENT EXCEPT PERHAPS INAN IMPERFECT COLONIAL WAY BUT THEY AROSE FROM REFLECTING THAT THISDISPENSATION TOO MIGHT BE A CHASTISEMENT FOR HIMSELF AS MR.FAREBROTHERS INDUCTION TO THE LIVING CLEARLY WAS.THIS WAS NOT WHAT MR. BULSTRODE SAID TO ANY MAN FOR THE SAKE OFDECEIVING HIM IT WAS WHAT HE SAID TO HIMSELFIT WAS AS GENUINELY HISMODE OF EXPLAINING EVENTS AS ANY THEORY OF YOURS MAY BE IF YOU HAPPENTO DISAGREE WITH HIM. FOR THE EGOISM WHICH ENTERS INTO OUR THEORIESDOES NOT AFFECT THEIR SINCERITY RATHER THE MORE OUR EGOISM ISSATISFIED THE MORE ROBUST IS OUR BELIEF.HOWEVER WHETHER FOR SANCTION OR FOR CHASTISEMENT MR. BULSTRODEHARDLY FIFTEEN MONTHS AFTER THE DEATH OF PETER FEATHERSTONE HAD BECOMETHE PROPRIETOR OF STONE COURT AND WHAT PETER WOULD SAY IF HE WEREWORTHY TO KNOW HAD BECOME AN INEXHAUSTIBLE AND CONSOLATORY SUBJECT OFCONVERSATION TO HIS DISAPPOINTED RELATIVES. THE TABLES WERE NOW TURNEDON THAT DEAR BROTHER DEPARTED AND TO CONTEMPLATE THE FRUSTRATION OFHIS CUNNING BY THE SUPERIOR CUNNING OF THINGS IN GENERAL WAS A CUD OFDELIGHT TO SOLOMON. MRS. WAULE HAD A MELANCHOLY TRIUMPH IN THE PROOFTHAT IT DID NOT ANSWER TO MAKE FALSE FEATHERSTONES AND CUT OFF THEGENUINE AND SISTER MARTHA RECEIVING THE NEWS IN THE CHALKY FLATS SAIDDEAR DEAR THEN THE ALMIGHTY COULD HAVE BEEN NONE SO PLEASED WITH THEALMSHOUSES AFTER ALL.AFFECTIONATE MRS. BULSTRODE WAS PARTICULARLY GLAD OF THE ADVANTAGEWHICH HER HUSBANDS HEALTH WAS LIKELY TO GET FROM THE PURCHASE OF STONECOURT. FEW DAYS PASSED WITHOUT HIS RIDING THITHER AND LOOKING OVER SOMEPART OF THE FARM WITH THE BAILIFF AND THE EVENINGS WERE DELICIOUS INTHAT QUIET SPOT WHEN THE NEW HAYRICKS LATELY SET UP WERE SENDINGFORTH ODORS TO MINGLE WITH THE BREATH OF THE RICH OLD GARDEN. ONEEVENING WHILE THE SUN WAS STILL ABOVE THE HORIZON AND BURNING INGOLDEN LAMPS AMONG THE GREAT WALNUT BOUGHS MR. BULSTRODE WAS PAUSINGON HORSEBACK OUTSIDE THE FRONT GATE WAITING FOR CALEB GARTH WHO HADMET HIM BY APPOINTMENT TO GIVE AN OPINION ON A QUESTION OF STABLEDRAINAGE AND WAS NOW ADVISING THE BAILIFF IN THE RICKYARD.MR. BULSTRODE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING IN A GOOD SPIRITUAL FRAME AND MORETHAN USUALLY SERENE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HIS INNOCENT RECREATION. HEWAS DOCTRINALLY CONVINCED THAT THERE WAS A TOTAL ABSENCE OF MERIT INHIMSELF BUT THAT DOCTRINAL CONVICTION MAY BE HELD WITHOUT PAIN WHENTHE SENSE OF DEMERIT DOES NOT TAKE A DISTINCT SHAPE IN MEMORY ANDREVIVE THE TINGLING OF SHAME OR THE PANG OF REMORSE. NAY IT MAY BEHELD WITH INTENSE SATISFACTION WHEN THE DEPTH OF OUR SINNING IS BUT AMEASURE FOR THE DEPTH OF FORGIVENESS AND A CLENCHING PROOF THAT WE AREPECULIAR INSTRUMENTS OF THE DIVINE INTENTION. THE MEMORY HAS AS MANYMOODS AS THE TEMPER AND SHIFTS ITS SCENERY LIKE A DIORAMA. AT THISMOMENT MR. BULSTRODE FELT AS IF THE SUNSHINE WERE ALL ONE WITH THAT OFFAROFF EVENINGS WHEN HE WAS A VERY YOUNG MAN AND USED TO GO OUTPREACHING BEYOND HIGHBURY. AND HE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE HAD THAT SERVICEOF EXHORTATION IN PROSPECT NOW. THE TEXTS WERE THERE STILL AND SO WASHIS OWN FACILITY IN EXPOUNDING THEM. HIS BRIEF REVERIE WAS INTERRUPTEDBY THE RETURN OF CALEB GARTH WHO ALSO WAS ON HORSEBACK AND WAS JUSTSHAKING HIS BRIDLE BEFORE STARTING WHEN HE EXCLAIMEDBLESS MY HEART WHATS THIS FELLOW IN BLACK COMING ALONG THE LANEHES LIKE ONE OF THOSE MEN ONE SEES ABOUT AFTER THE RACES.MR. BULSTRODE TURNED HIS HORSE AND LOOKED ALONG THE LANE BUT MADE NOREPLY. THE COMER WAS OUR SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE MR. RAFFLES WHOSEAPPEARANCE PRESENTED NO OTHER CHANGE THAN SUCH AS WAS DUE TO A SUIT OFBLACK AND A CRAPE HATBAND. HE WAS WITHIN THREE YARDS OF THE HORSEMANNOW AND THEY COULD SEE THE FLASH OF RECOGNITION IN HIS FACE AS HEWHIRLED HIS STICK UPWARD LOOKING ALL THE WHILE AT MR. BULSTRODE ANDAT LAST EXCLAIMINGBY JOVE NICK ITS YOU I COULDNT BE MISTAKEN THOUGH THEFIVEANDTWENTY YEARS HAVE PLAYED OLD BOGUY WITH US BOTH HOW ARE YOUEH YOU DIDNT EXPECT TO SEE ME HERE. COME SHAKE US BY THE HAND. TOSAY THAT MR. RAFFLES MANNER WAS RATHER EXCITED WOULD BE ONLY ONE MODEOF SAYING THAT IT WAS EVENING. CALEB GARTH COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS AMOMENT OF STRUGGLE AND HESITATION IN MR. BULSTRODE BUT IT ENDED IN HISPUTTING OUT HIS HAND COLDLY TO RAFFLES AND SAYINGI DID NOT INDEED EXPECT TO SEE YOU IN THIS REMOTE COUNTRY PLACE.WELL IT BELONGS TO A STEPSON OF MINE SAID RAFFLES ADJUSTINGHIMSELF IN A SWAGGERING ATTITUDE. I CAME TO SEE HIM HERE BEFORE. IMNOT SO SURPRISED AT SEEING YOU OLD FELLOW BECAUSE I PICKED UP ALETTERWHAT YOU MAY CALL A PROVIDENTIAL THING. ITS UNCOMMONLYFORTUNATE I MET YOU THOUGH FOR I DONT CARE ABOUT SEEING MY STEPSONHES NOT AFFECTIONATE AND HIS POOR MOTHERS GONE NOW. TO TELL THETRUTH I CAME OUT OF LOVE TO YOU NICK I CAME TO GET YOUR ADDRESSFORLOOK HERE RAFFLES DREW A CRUMPLED PAPER FROM HIS POCKET.ALMOST ANY OTHER MAN THAN CALEB GARTH MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO LINGERON THE SPOT FOR THE SAKE OF HEARING ALL HE COULD ABOUT A MAN WHOSEACQUAINTANCE WITH BULSTRODE SEEMED TO IMPLY PASSAGES IN THE BANKERSLIFE SO UNLIKE ANYTHING THAT WAS KNOWN OF HIM IN MIDDLEMARCH THAT THEYMUST HAVE THE NATURE OF A SECRET TO PIQUE CURIOSITY. BUT CALEB WASPECULIAR CERTAIN HUMAN TENDENCIES WHICH ARE COMMONLY STRONG WEREALMOST ABSENT FROM HIS MIND AND ONE OF THESE WAS CURIOSITY ABOUTPERSONAL AFFAIRS. ESPECIALLY IF THERE WAS ANYTHING DISCREDITABLE TO BEFOUND OUT CONCERNING ANOTHER MAN CALEB PREFERRED NOT TO KNOW IT ANDIF HE HAD TO TELL ANYBODY UNDER HIM THAT HIS EVIL DOINGS WEREDISCOVERED HE WAS MORE EMBARRASSED THAN THE CULPRIT. HE NOW SPURREDHIS HORSE AND SAYING I WISH YOU GOOD EVENING MR. BULSTRODE I MUSTBE GETTING HOME SET OFF AT A TROT.YOU DIDNT PUT YOUR FULL ADDRESS TO THIS LETTER RAFFLES CONTINUED.THAT WAS NOT LIKE THE FIRSTRATE MAN OF BUSINESS YOU USED TO BE.

LORD HOW MANY YEARS IT IS AGO THE OLD LADYMUST HAVE BEEN DEAD A PRETTY LONG WHILEGONE TO GLORY WITHOUT THE PAINOF KNOWING HOW POOR HER DAUGHTER WAS EH BUT BY JOVE YOURE VERYPALE AND PASTY NICK. COME IF YOURE GOING HOME ILL WALK BY YOURSIDE.MR. BULSTRODES USUAL PALENESS HAD IN FACT TAKEN AN ALMOST DEATHLY HUE.FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE EXPANSE OF HIS LIFE HAD BEEN SUBMERGED IN ITSEVENING SUNSHINE WHICH SHONE BACKWARD TO ITS REMEMBERED MORNING SINSEEMED TO BE A QUESTION OF DOCTRINE AND INWARD PENITENCE HUMILIATIONAN EXERCISE OF THE CLOSET THE BEARING OF HIS DEEDS A MATTER OF PRIVATEVISION ADJUSTED SOLELY BY SPIRITUAL RELATIONS AND CONCEPTIONS OF THEDIVINE PURPOSES. AND NOW AS IF BY SOME HIDEOUS MAGIC THIS LOUD REDFIGURE HAD RISEN BEFORE HIM IN UNMANAGEABLE SOLIDITYAN INCORPORATEPAST WHICH HAD NOT ENTERED INTO HIS IMAGINATION OF CHASTISEMENTS. BUTMR. BULSTRODES THOUGHT WAS BUSY AND HE WAS NOT A MAN TO ACT OR SPEAKRASHLY.I WAS GOING HOME HE SAID BUT I CAN DEFER MY RIDE A LITTLE. AND YOUCAN IF YOU PLEASE REST HERE.THANK YOU SAID RAFFLES MAKING A GRIMACE. I DONT CARE NOW ABOUTSEEING MY STEPSON. ID RATHER GO HOME WITH YOU.YOUR STEPSON IF MR. RIGG FEATHERSTONE WAS HE IS HERE NO LONGER. I AMMASTER HERE NOW.RAFFLES OPENED WIDE EYES AND GAVE A LONG WHISTLE OF SURPRISE BEFOREHE SAID WELL THEN IVE NO OBJECTION. IVE HAD ENOUGH WALKING FROMTHE COACHROAD. I NEVER WAS MUCH OF A WALKER OR RIDER EITHER. WHAT ILIKE IS A SMART VEHICLE AND A SPIRITED COB. I WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE HEAVYIN THE SADDLE. WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE IT MUST BE TO YOU TO SEE MEOLD FELLOW HE CONTINUED AS THEY TURNED TOWARDS THE HOUSE. YOU DONTSAY SO BUT YOU NEVER TOOK YOUR LUCK HEARTILYYOU WERE ALWAYS THINKINGOF IMPROVING THE OCCASIONYOUD SUCH A GIFT FOR IMPROVING YOUR LUCK.MR. RAFFLES SEEMED GREATLY TO ENJOY HIS OWN WIT AND SWUNG HIS LEG IN ASWAGGERING MANNER WHICH WAS RATHER TOO MUCH FOR HIS COMPANIONSJUDICIOUS PATIENCE.IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY MR. BULSTRODE OBSERVED WITH CHILL ANGER OURACQUAINTANCE MANY YEARS AGO HAD NOT THE SORT OF INTIMACY WHICH YOU ARENOW ASSUMING MR. RAFFLES. ANY SERVICES YOU DESIRE OF ME WILL BE THEMORE READILY RENDERED IF YOU WILL AVOID A TONE OF FAMILIARITY WHICH DIDNOT LIE IN OUR FORMER INTERCOURSE AND CAN HARDLY BE WARRANTED BY MORETHAN TWENTY YEARS OF SEPARATION.YOU DONT LIKE BEING CALLED NICK WHY I ALWAYS CALLED YOU NICK IN MYHEART AND THOUGH LOST TO SIGHT TO MEMORY DEAR. BY JOVE MY FEELINGSHAVE RIPENED FOR YOU LIKE FINE OLD COGNAC. I HOPE YOUVE GOT SOME INTHE HOUSE NOW. JOSH FILLED MY FLASK WELL THE LAST TIME.MR. BULSTRODE HAD NOT YET FULLY LEARNED THAT EVEN THE DESIRE FOR COGNACWAS NOT STRONGER IN RAFFLES THAN THE DESIRE TO TORMENT AND THAT A HINTOF ANNOYANCE ALWAYS SERVED HIM AS A FRESH CUE. BUT IT WAS AT LEASTCLEAR THAT FURTHER OBJECTION WAS USELESS AND MR. BULSTRODE IN GIVINGORDERS TO THE HOUSEKEEPER FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE GUEST HAD ARESOLUTE AIR OF QUIETUDE.THERE WAS THE COMFORT OF THINKING THAT THIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD BEEN IN THESERVICE OF RIGG ALSO AND MIGHT ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT MR. BULSTRODEENTERTAINED RAFFLES MERELY AS A FRIEND OF HER FORMER MASTER.WHEN THERE WAS FOOD AND DRINK SPREAD BEFORE HIS VISITOR IN THEWAINSCOTED PARLOR AND NO WITNESS IN THE ROOM MR. BULSTRODE SAIDYOUR HABITS AND MINE ARE SO DIFFERENT MR. RAFFLES THAT WE CAN HARDLYENJOY EACH OTHERS SOCIETY. THE WISEST PLAN FOR BOTH OF US WILLTHEREFORE BE TO PART AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SINCE YOU SAY THAT YOU WISHEDTO MEET ME YOU PROBABLY CONSIDERED THAT YOU HAD SOME BUSINESS TOTRANSACT WITH ME. BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I WILL INVITE YOU TOREMAIN HERE FOR THE NIGHT AND I WILL MYSELF RIDE OVER HERE EARLYTOMORROW MORNINGBEFORE BREAKFAST IN FACTWHEN I CAN RECEIVE ANYCOMMUNICATION YOU HAVE TO MAKE TO ME.WITH ALL MY HEART SAID RAFFLES THIS IS A COMFORTABLE PLACEALITTLE DULL FOR A CONTINUANCE BUT I CAN PUT UP WITH IT FOR A NIGHTWITH THIS GOOD LIQUOR AND THE PROSPECT OF SEEING YOU AGAIN IN THEMORNING. YOURE A MUCH BETTER HOST THAN MY STEPSON WAS BUT JOSH OWEDME A BIT OF A GRUDGE FOR MARRYING HIS MOTHER AND BETWEEN YOU AND METHERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING BUT KINDNESS.MR. BULSTRODE HOPING THAT THE PECULIAR MIXTURE OF JOVIALITY ANDSNEERING IN RAFFLES MANNER WAS A GOOD DEAL THE EFFECT OF DRINK HADDETERMINED TO WAIT TILL HE WAS QUITE SOBER BEFORE HE SPENT MORE WORDSUPON HIM. BUT HE RODE HOME WITH A TERRIBLY LUCID VISION OF THEDIFFICULTY THERE WOULD BE IN ARRANGING ANY RESULT THAT COULD BEPERMANENTLY COUNTED ON WITH THIS MAN. IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT HE SHOULDWISH TO GET RID OF JOHN RAFFLES THOUGH HIS REAPPEARANCE COULD NOT BEREGARDED AS LYING OUTSIDE THE DIVINE PLAN. THE SPIRIT OF EVIL MIGHTHAVE SENT HIM TO THREATEN MR. BULSTRODES SUBVERSION AS AN INSTRUMENTOF GOOD BUT THE THREAT MUST HAVE BEEN PERMITTED AND WAS ACHASTISEMENT OF A NEW KIND. IT WAS AN HOUR OF ANGUISH FOR HIM VERYDIFFERENT FROM THE HOURS IN WHICH HIS STRUGGLE HAD BEEN SECURELYPRIVATE AND WHICH HAD ENDED WITH A SENSE THAT HIS SECRET MISDEEDS WEREPARDONED AND HIS SERVICES ACCEPTED. THOSE MISDEEDS EVEN WHENCOMMITTEDHAD THEY NOT BEEN HALF SANCTIFIED BY THE SINGLENESS OF HISDESIRE TO DEVOTE HIMSELF AND ALL HE POSSESSED TO THE FURTHERANCE OF THEDIVINE SCHEME AND WAS HE AFTER ALL TO BECOME A MERE STONE OF STUMBLINGAND A ROCK OF OFFENCE FOR WHO WOULD UNDERSTAND THE WORK WITHIN HIMWHO WOULD NOT WHEN THERE WAS THE PRETEXT OF CASTING DISGRACE UPON HIMCONFOUND HIS WHOLE LIFE AND THE TRUTHS HE HAD ESPOUSED IN ONE HEAP OFOBLOQUYIN HIS CLOSEST MEDITATIONS THE LIFELONG HABIT OF MR. BULSTRODES MINDCLAD HIS MOST EGOISTIC TERRORS IN DOCTRINAL REFERENCES TO SUPERHUMANENDS. BUT EVEN WHILE WE ARE TALKING AND MEDITATING ABOUT THE EARTHSORBIT AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM WHAT WE FEEL AND ADJUST OUR MOVEMENTS TO ISTHE STABLE EARTH AND THE CHANGING DAY. AND NOW WITHIN ALL THE AUTOMATICSUCCESSION OF THEORETIC PHRASESDISTINCT AND INMOST AS THE SHIVER ANDTHE ACHE OF ONCOMING FEVER WHEN WE ARE DISCUSSING ABSTRACT PAIN WASTHE FORECAST OF DISGRACE IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS NEIGHBORS AND OF HISOWN WIFE. FOR THE PAIN AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC ESTIMATE OF DISGRACEDEPENDS ON THE AMOUNT OF PREVIOUS PROFESSION. TO MEN WHO ONLY AIM ATESCAPING FELONY NOTHING SHORT OF THE PRISONERS DOCK IS DISGRACE. BUTMR. BULSTRODE HAD AIMED AT BEING AN EMINENT CHRISTIAN.IT WAS NOT MORE THAN HALFPAST SEVEN IN THE MORNING WHEN HE AGAINREACHED STONE COURT. THE FINE OLD PLACE NEVER LOOKED MORE LIKE ADELIGHTFUL HOME THAN AT THAT MOMENT THE GREAT WHITE LILIES WERE INFLOWER THE NASTURTIUMS THEIR PRETTY LEAVES ALL SILVERED WITH DEWWERE RUNNING AWAY OVER THE LOW STONE WALL THE VERY NOISES ALL AROUNDHAD A HEART OF PEACE WITHIN THEM. BUT EVERYTHING WAS SPOILED FOR THEOWNER AS HE WALKED ON THE GRAVEL IN FRONT AND AWAITED THE DESCENT OFMR. RAFFLES WITH WHOM HE WAS CONDEMNED TO BREAKFAST.IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY WERE SEATED TOGETHER IN THE WAINSCOTEDPARLOR OVER THEIR TEA AND TOAST WHICH WAS AS MUCH AS RAFFLES CARED TOTAKE AT THAT EARLY HOUR. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS MORNING AND EVENINGSELF WAS NOT SO GREAT AS HIS COMPANION HAD IMAGINED THAT IT MIGHT BETHE DELIGHT IN TORMENTING WAS PERHAPS EVEN THE STRONGER BECAUSE HISSPIRITS WERE RATHER LESS HIGHLY PITCHED. CERTAINLY HIS MANNERS SEEMEDMORE DISAGREEABLE BY THE MORNING LIGHT.AS I HAVE LITTLE TIME TO SPARE MR. RAFFLES SAID THE BANKER WHOCOULD HARDLY DO MORE THAN SIP HIS TEA AND BREAK HIS TOAST WITHOUTEATING IT I SHALL BE OBLIGED IF YOU WILL MENTION AT ONCE THE GROUNDON WHICH YOU WISHED TO MEET WITH ME. I PRESUME THAT YOU HAVE A HOMEELSEWHERE AND WILL BE GLAD TO RETURN TO IT.WHY IF A MAN HAS GOT ANY HEART DOESNT HE WANT TO SEE AN OLD FRIENDNICKI MUST CALL YOU NICKWE ALWAYS DID CALL YOU YOUNG NICK WHEN WEKNEW YOU MEANT TO MARRY THE OLD WIDOW. SOME SAID YOU HAD A HANDSOMEFAMILY LIKENESS TO OLD NICK BUT THAT WAS YOUR MOTHERS FAULT CALLINGYOU NICHOLAS. ARENT YOU GLAD TO SEE ME AGAIN I EXPECTED AN INVITE TOSTAY WITH YOU AT SOME PRETTY PLACE. MY OWN ESTABLISHMENT IS BROKEN UPNOW MY WIFES DEAD. IVE NO PARTICULAR ATTACHMENT TO ANY SPOT I WOULDAS SOON SETTLE HEREABOUT AS ANYWHERE.MAY I ASK WHY YOU RETURNED FROM AMERICA I CONSIDERED THAT THE STRONGWISH YOU EXPRESSED TO GO THERE WHEN AN ADEQUATE SUM WAS FURNISHED WASTANTAMOUNT TO AN ENGAGEMENT THAT YOU WOULD REMAIN THERE FOR LIFE.NEVER KNEW THAT A WISH TO GO TO A PLACE WAS THE SAME THING AS A WISHTO STAY. BUT I DID STAY A MATTER OF TEN YEARS IT DIDNT SUIT ME TOSTAY ANY LONGER. AND IM NOT GOING AGAIN NICK. HERE MR. RAFFLESWINKED SLOWLY AS HE LOOKED AT MR. BULSTRODE.DO YOU WISH TO BE SETTLED IN ANY BUSINESS WHAT IS YOUR CALLING NOWTHANK YOU MY CALLING IS TO ENJOY MYSELF AS MUCH AS I CAN. I DONTCARE ABOUT WORKING ANY MORE. IF I DID ANYTHING IT WOULD BE A LITTLETRAVELLING IN THE TOBACCO LINEOR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT WHICH TAKES AMAN INTO AGREEABLE COMPANY. BUT NOT WITHOUT AN INDEPENDENCE TO FALLBACK UPON. THATS WHAT I WANT IM NOT SO STRONG AS I WAS NICK THOUGHIVE GOT MORE COLOR THAN YOU. I WANT AN INDEPENDENCE.THAT COULD BE SUPPLIED TO YOU IF YOU WOULD ENGAGE TO KEEP AT ADISTANCE SAID MR. BULSTRODE PERHAPS WITH A LITTLE TOO MUCH EAGERNESSIN HIS UNDERTONE.THAT MUST BE AS IT SUITS MY CONVENIENCE SAID RAFFLES COOLLY. I SEENO REASON WHY I SHOULDNT MAKE A FEW ACQUAINTANCES HEREABOUT. IM NOTASHAMED OF MYSELF AS COMPANY FOR ANYBODY. I DROPPED MY PORTMANTEAU ATTHE TURNPIKE WHEN I GOT DOWNCHANGE OF LINENGENUINEHONOR BRIGHTMORETHAN FRONTS AND WRISTBANDS AND WITH THIS SUIT OF MOURNING STRAPS ANDEVERYTHING I SHOULD DO YOU CREDIT AMONG THE NOBS HERE. MR. RAFFLESHAD PUSHED AWAY HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED DOWN AT HIMSELF PARTICULARLY ATHIS STRAPS. HIS CHIEF INTENTION WAS TO ANNOY BULSTRODE BUT HE REALLYTHOUGHT THAT HIS APPEARANCE NOW WOULD PRODUCE A GOOD EFFECT AND THATHE WAS NOT ONLY HANDSOME AND WITTY BUT CLAD IN A MOURNING STYLE WHICHIMPLIED SOLID CONNECTIONS.IF YOU INTEND TO RELY ON ME IN ANY WAY MR. RAFFLES SAID BULSTRODEAFTER A MOMENTS PAUSE YOU WILL EXPECT TO MEET MY WISHES.AH TO BE SURE SAID RAFFLES WITH A MOCKING CORDIALITY. DIDNT IALWAYS DO IT LORD YOU MADE A PRETTY THING OUT OF ME AND I GOT BUTLITTLE. IVE OFTEN THOUGHT SINCE I MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER BY TELLINGTHE OLD WOMAN THAT ID FOUND HER DAUGHTER AND HER GRANDCHILD IT WOULDHAVE SUITED MY FEELINGS BETTER IVE GOT A SOFT PLACE IN MY HEART. BUTYOUVE BURIED THE OLD LADY BY THIS TIME I SUPPOSEITS ALL ONE TO HERNOW. AND YOUVE GOT YOUR FORTUNE OUT OF THAT PROFITABLE BUSINESS WHICHHAD SUCH A BLESSING ON IT. YOUVE TAKEN TO BEING A NOB BUYING LANDBEING A COUNTRY BASHAW. STILL IN THE DISSENTING LINE EH STILL GODLYOR TAKEN TO THE CHURCH AS MORE GENTEELTHIS TIME MR. RAFFLES SLOW WINK AND SLIGHT PROTRUSION OF HIS TONGUEWAS WORSE THAN A NIGHTMARE BECAUSE IT HELD THE CERTITUDE THAT IT WASNOT A NIGHTMARE BUT A WAKING MISERY. MR. BULSTRODE FELT A SHUDDERINGNAUSEA AND DID NOT SPEAK BUT WAS CONSIDERING DILIGENTLY WHETHER HESHOULD NOT LEAVE RAFFLES TO DO AS HE WOULD AND SIMPLY DEFY HIM AS ASLANDERER. THE MAN WOULD SOON SHOW HIMSELF DISREPUTABLE ENOUGH TO MAKEPEOPLE DISBELIEVE HIM. BUT NOT WHEN HE TELLS ANY UGLYLOOKING TRUTHABOUT YOU SAID DISCERNING CONSCIOUSNESS. AND AGAIN IT SEEMED NOWRONG TO KEEP RAFFLES AT A DISTANCE BUT MR. BULSTRODE SHRANK FROM THEDIRECT FALSEHOOD OF DENYING TRUE STATEMENTS. IT WAS ONE THING TO LOOKBACK ON FORGIVEN SINS NAY TO EXPLAIN QUESTIONABLE CONFORMITY TO LAXCUSTOMS AND ANOTHER TO ENTER DELIBERATELY ON THE NECESSITY OFFALSEHOOD.BUT SINCE BULSTRODE DID NOT SPEAK RAFFLES RAN ON BY WAY OF USING TIMETO THE UTMOST.IVE NOT HAD SUCH FINE LUCK AS YOU BY JOVE THINGS WENT CONFOUNDEDLYWITH ME IN NEW YORK THOSE YANKEES ARE COOL HANDS AND A MAN OFGENTLEMANLY FEELINGS HAS NO CHANCE WITH THEM. I MARRIED WHEN I CAMEBACKA NICE WOMAN IN THE TOBACCO TRADEVERY FOND OF MEBUT THE TRADEWAS RESTRICTED AS WE SAY. SHE HAD BEEN SETTLED THERE A GOOD MANY YEARSBY A FRIEND BUT THERE WAS A SON TOO MUCH IN THE CASE. JOSH AND I NEVERHIT IT OFF. HOWEVER I MADE THE MOST OF THE POSITION AND IVE ALWAYSTAKEN MY GLASS IN GOOD COMPANY. ITS BEEN ALL ON THE SQUARE WITH MEIM AS OPEN AS THE DAY. YOU WONT TAKE IT ILL OF ME THAT I DIDNT LOOKYOU UP BEFORE. IVE GOT A COMPLAINT THAT MAKES ME A LITTLE DILATORY. ITHOUGHT YOU WERE TRADING AND PRAYING AWAY IN LONDON STILL AND DIDNTFIND YOU THERE. BUT YOU SEE I WAS SENT TO YOU NICKPERHAPS FOR ABLESSING TO BOTH OF US.MR. RAFFLES ENDED WITH A JOCOSE SNUFFLE NO MAN FELT HIS INTELLECT MORESUPERIOR TO RELIGIOUS CANT. AND IF THE CUNNING WHICH CALCULATES ON THEMEANEST FEELINGS IN MEN COULD BE CALLED INTELLECT HE HAD HIS SHAREFOR UNDER THE BLURTING RALLYING TONE WITH WHICH HE SPOKE TO BULSTRODETHERE WAS AN EVIDENT SELECTION OF STATEMENTS AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SOMANY MOVES AT CHESS. MEANWHILE BULSTRODE HAD DETERMINED ON HIS MOVEAND HE SAID WITH GATHERED RESOLUTIONYOU WILL DO WELL TO REFLECT MR. RAFFLES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR AMAN TO OVERREACH HIMSELF IN THE EFFORT TO SECURE UNDUE ADVANTAGE.ALTHOUGH I AM NOT IN ANY WAY BOUND TO YOU I AM WILLING TO SUPPLY YOUWITH A REGULAR ANNUITYIN QUARTERLY PAYMENTSSO LONG AS YOU FULFIL APROMISE TO REMAIN AT A DISTANCE FROM THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. IT IS IN YOURPOWER TO CHOOSE. IF YOU INSIST ON REMAINING HERE EVEN FOR A SHORTTIME YOU WILL GET NOTHING FROM ME. I SHALL DECLINE TO KNOW YOU.HA HA SAID RAFFLES WITH AN AFFECTED EXPLOSION THAT REMINDS ME OFA DROLL DOG OF A THIEF WHO DECLINED TO KNOW THE CONSTABLE.YOUR ALLUSIONS ARE LOST ON ME SIR SAID BULSTRODE WITH WHITE HEATTHE LAW HAS NO HOLD ON ME EITHER THROUGH YOUR AGENCY OR ANY OTHER.YOU CANT UNDERSTAND A JOKE MY GOOD FELLOW. I ONLY MEANT THAT ISHOULD NEVER DECLINE TO KNOW YOU. BUT LET US BE SERIOUS. YOUR QUARTERLYPAYMENT WONT QUITE SUIT ME. I LIKE MY FREEDOM.HERE RAFFLES ROSE AND STALKED ONCE OR TWICE UP AND DOWN THE ROOMSWINGING HIS LEG AND ASSUMING AN AIR OF MASTERLY MEDITATION. AT LASTHE STOPPED OPPOSITE BULSTRODE AND SAID ILL TELL YOU WHAT GIVE US ACOUPLE OF HUNDREDSCOME THATS MODESTAND ILL GO AWAYHONORBRIGHTPICK UP MY PORTMANTEAU AND GO AWAY. BUT I SHALL NOT GIVE UP MYLIBERTY FOR A DIRTY ANNUITY. I SHALL COME AND GO WHERE I LIKE. PERHAPSIT MAY SUIT ME TO STAY AWAY AND CORRESPOND WITH A FRIEND PERHAPS NOT.HAVE YOU THE MONEY WITH YOUNO I HAVE ONE HUNDRED SAID BULSTRODE FEELING THE IMMEDIATERIDDANCE TOO GREAT A RELIEF TO BE REJECTED ON THE GROUND OF FUTUREUNCERTAINTIES. I WILL FORWARD YOU THE OTHER IF YOU WILL MENTION ANADDRESS.NO ILL WAIT HERE TILL YOU BRING IT SAID RAFFLES. ILL TAKE ASTROLL AND HAVE A SNACK AND YOULL BE BACK BY THAT TIME.MR. BULSTRODES SICKLY BODY SHATTERED BY THE AGITATIONS HE HAD GONETHROUGH SINCE THE LAST EVENING MADE HIM FEEL ABJECTLY IN THE POWER OFTHIS LOUD INVULNERABLE MAN. AT THAT MOMENT HE SNATCHED AT A TEMPORARYREPOSE TO BE WON ON ANY TERMS. HE WAS RISING TO DO WHAT RAFFLESSUGGESTED WHEN THE LATTER SAID LIFTING UP HIS FINGER AS IF WITH ASUDDEN RECOLLECTIONI DID HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AFTER SARAH AGAIN THOUGH I DIDNT TELL YOUID A TENDER CONSCIENCE ABOUT THAT PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN. I DIDNT FINDHER BUT I FOUND OUT HER HUSBANDS NAME AND I MADE A NOTE OF IT. BUTHANG IT I LOST MY POCKETBOOK. HOWEVER IF I HEARD IT I SHOULD KNOW ITAGAIN. IVE GOT MY FACULTIES AS IF I WAS IN MY PRIME BUT NAMES WEAROUT BY JOVE SOMETIMES IM NO BETTER THAN A CONFOUNDED TAXPAPERBEFORE THE NAMES ARE FILLED IN. HOWEVER IF I HEAR OF HER AND HERFAMILY YOU SHALL KNOW NICK. YOUD LIKE TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER NOWSHES YOUR STEPDAUGHTER.DOUBTLESS SAID MR. BULSTRODE WITH THE USUAL STEADY LOOK OF HISLIGHTGRAY EYES THOUGH THAT MIGHT REDUCE MY POWER OF ASSISTING YOU.AS HE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM RAFFLES WINKED SLOWLY AT HIS BACK ANDTHEN TURNED TOWARDS THE WINDOW TO WATCH THE BANKER RIDINGAWAYVIRTUALLY AT HIS COMMAND. HIS LIPS FIRST CURLED WITH A SMILE ANDTHEN OPENED WITH A SHORT TRIUMPHANT LAUGH.BUT WHAT THE DEUCE WAS THE NAME HE PRESENTLY SAID HALF ALOUDSCRATCHING HIS HEAD AND WRINKLING HIS BROWS HORIZONTALLY. HE HAD NOTREALLY CARED OR THOUGHT ABOUT THIS POINT OF FORGETFULNESS UNTIL ITOCCURRED TO HIM IN HIS INVENTION OF ANNOYANCES FOR BULSTRODE.IT BEGAN WITH L IT WAS ALMOST ALL LS I FANCY HE WENT ON WITH ASENSE THAT HE WAS GETTING HOLD OF THE SLIPPERY NAME. BUT THE HOLD WASTOO SLIGHT AND HE SOON GOT TIRED OF THIS MENTAL CHASE FOR FEW MENWERE MORE IMPATIENT OF PRIVATE OCCUPATION OR MORE IN NEED OF MAKINGTHEMSELVES CONTINUALLY HEARD THAN MR. RAFFLES. HE PREFERRED USING HISTIME IN PLEASANT CONVERSATION WITH THE BAILIFF AND THE HOUSEKEEPERFROM WHOM HE GATHERED AS MUCH AS HE WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT MR.BULSTRODES POSITION IN MIDDLEMARCH.AFTER ALL HOWEVER THERE WAS A DULL SPACE OF TIME WHICH NEEDEDRELIEVING WITH BREAD AND CHEESE AND ALE AND WHEN HE WAS SEATED ALONEWITH THESE RESOURCES IN THE WAINSCOTED PARLOR HE SUDDENLY SLAPPED HISKNEE AND EXCLAIMED LADISLAW THAT ACTION OF MEMORY WHICH HE HADTRIED TO SET GOING AND HAD ABANDONED IN DESPAIR HAD SUDDENLYCOMPLETED ITSELF WITHOUT CONSCIOUS EFFORTA COMMON EXPERIENCEAGREEABLE AS A COMPLETED SNEEZE EVEN IF THE NAME REMEMBERED IS OF NOVALUE. RAFFLES IMMEDIATELY TOOK OUT HIS POCKETBOOK AND WROTE DOWN THENAME NOT BECAUSE HE EXPECTED TO USE IT BUT MERELY FOR THE SAKE OF NOTBEING AT A LOSS IF HE EVER DID HAPPEN TO WANT IT. HE WAS NOT GOING TOTELL BULSTRODE THERE WAS NO ACTUAL GOOD IN TELLING AND TO A MIND LIKETHAT OF MR. RAFFLES THERE IS ALWAYS PROBABLE GOOD IN A SECRET.HE WAS SATISFIED WITH HIS PRESENT SUCCESS AND BY THREE OCLOCK THATDAY HE HAD TAKEN UP HIS PORTMANTEAU AT THE TURNPIKE AND MOUNTED THECOACH RELIEVING MR. BULSTRODES EYES OF AN UGLY BLACK SPOT ON THELANDSCAPE AT STONE COURT BUT NOT RELIEVING HIM OF THE DREAD THAT THEBLACK SPOT MIGHT REAPPEAR AND BECOME INSEPARABLE EVEN FROM THE VISIONOF HIS HEARTH.BOOK VI.THE WIDOW AND THE WIFE.CHAPTER LIV.NEGLI OCCHI PORTA LA MIA DONNA AMOREPER CHE SI FA GENTIL CI CHELLA MIRAOVELLA PASSA OGNI UOM VER LEI SI GIRAE CUI SALUTA FA TREMAR LO CORE.SICCH BASSANDO IL VISO TUTTO SMOREE DOGNI SUO DIFETTO ALLOR SOSPIRAFUGGON DINANZI A LEI SUPERBIA ED IRAAIUTATEMI DONNE A FARLE ONORE.OGNI DOLCEZZA OGNI PENSIERO UMILENASCE NEL CORE A CHI PARLAR LA SENTEOND BEATO CHI PRIMA LA VIDE.QUEL CHELLA PAR QUAND UN POCO SORRIDENON SI PU DICER N TENER A MENTESI  NUOVO MIRACOLO GENTILE.DANTE LA VITA NUOVA.BY THAT DELIGHTFUL MORNING WHEN THE HAYRICKS AT STONE COURT WERESCENTING THE AIR QUITE IMPARTIALLY AS IF MR. RAFFLES HAD BEEN A GUESTWORTHY OF FINEST INCENSE DOROTHEA HAD AGAIN TAKEN UP HER ABODE ATLOWICK MANOR. AFTER THREE MONTHS FRESHITT HAD BECOME RATHER OPPRESSIVETO SIT LIKE A MODEL FOR SAINT CATHERINE LOOKING RAPTUROUSLY AT CELIASBABY WOULD NOT DO FOR MANY HOURS IN THE DAY AND TO REMAIN IN THATMOMENTOUS BABES PRESENCE WITH PERSISTENT DISREGARD WAS A COURSE THATCOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TOLERATED IN A CHILDLESS SISTER. DOROTHEA WOULDHAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF CARRYING BABY JOYFULLY FOR A MILE IF THERE HADBEEN NEED AND OF LOVING IT THE MORE TENDERLY FOR THAT LABOR BUT TO ANAUNT WHO DOES NOT RECOGNIZE HER INFANT NEPHEW AS BOUDDHA AND HASNOTHING TO DO FOR HIM BUT TO ADMIRE HIS BEHAVIOR IS APT TO APPEARMONOTONOUS AND THE INTEREST OF WATCHING HIM EXHAUSTIBLE. THISPOSSIBILITY WAS QUITE HIDDEN FROM CELIA WHO FELT THAT DOROTHEASCHILDLESS WIDOWHOOD FELL IN QUITE PRETTILY WITH THE BIRTH OF LITTLEARTHUR BABY WAS NAMED AFTER MR. BROOKE.DODO IS JUST THE CREATURE NOT TO MIND ABOUT HAVING ANYTHING OF HEROWNCHILDREN OR ANYTHING SAID CELIA TO HER HUSBAND. AND IF SHE HADHAD A BABY IT NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A DEAR AS ARTHUR. COULD ITJAMESNOT IF IT HAD BEEN LIKE CASAUBON SAID SIR JAMES CONSCIOUS OF SOMEINDIRECTNESS IN HIS ANSWER AND OF HOLDING A STRICTLY PRIVATE OPINIONAS TO THE PERFECTIONS OF HIS FIRSTBORN.NO JUST IMAGINE REALLY IT WAS A MERCY SAID CELIA AND I THINK ITIS VERY NICE FOR DODO TO BE A WIDOW. SHE CAN BE JUST AS FOND OF OURBABY AS IF IT WERE HER OWN AND SHE CAN HAVE AS MANY NOTIONS OF HER OWNAS SHE LIKES.IT IS A PITY SHE WAS NOT A QUEEN SAID THE DEVOUT SIR JAMES.BUT WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE BEEN THEN WE MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING ELSESAID CELIA OBJECTING TO SO LABORIOUS A FLIGHT OF IMAGINATION. I LIKEHER BETTER AS SHE IS.HENCE WHEN SHE FOUND THAT DOROTHEA WAS MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR HERFINAL DEPARTURE TO LOWICK CELIA RAISED HER EYEBROWS WITHDISAPPOINTMENT AND IN HER QUIET UNEMPHATIC WAY SHOT A NEEDLEARROW OFSARCASM.WHAT WILL YOU DO AT LOWICK DODO YOU SAY YOURSELF THERE IS NOTHING TOBE DONE THERE EVERYBODY IS SO CLEAN AND WELL OFF IT MAKES YOU QUITEMELANCHOLY. AND HERE YOU HAVE BEEN SO HAPPY GOING ALL ABOUT TIPTON WITHMR. GARTH INTO THE WORST BACKYARDS. AND NOW UNCLE IS ABROAD YOU ANDMR. GARTH CAN HAVE IT ALL YOUR OWN WAY AND I AM SURE JAMES DOESEVERYTHING YOU TELL HIM.I SHALL OFTEN COME HERE AND I SHALL SEE HOW BABY GROWS ALL THEBETTER SAID DOROTHEA.BUT YOU WILL NEVER SEE HIM WASHED SAID CELIA AND THAT IS QUITE THEBEST PART OF THE DAY. SHE WAS ALMOST POUTING IT DID SEEM TO HER VERYHARD IN DODO TO GO AWAY FROM THE BABY WHEN SHE MIGHT STAY.DEAR KITTY I WILL COME AND STAY ALL NIGHT ON PURPOSE SAID DOROTHEABUT I WANT TO BE ALONE NOW AND IN MY OWN HOME. I WISH TO KNOW THEFAREBROTHERS BETTER AND TO TALK TO MR. FAREBROTHER ABOUT WHAT THERE ISTO BE DONE IN MIDDLEMARCH.DOROTHEAS NATIVE STRENGTH OF WILL WAS NO LONGER ALL CONVERTED INTORESOLUTE SUBMISSION. SHE HAD A GREAT YEARNING TO BE AT LOWICK AND WASSIMPLY DETERMINED TO GO NOT FEELING BOUND TO TELL ALL HER REASONS. BUTEVERY ONE AROUND HER DISAPPROVED. SIR JAMES WAS MUCH PAINED ANDOFFERED THAT THEY SHOULD ALL MIGRATE TO CHELTENHAM FOR A FEW MONTHSWITH THE SACRED ARK OTHERWISE CALLED A CRADLE AT THAT PERIOD A MANCOULD HARDLY KNOW WHAT TO PROPOSE IF CHELTENHAM WERE REJECTED.THE DOWAGER LADY CHETTAM JUST RETURNED FROM A VISIT TO HER DAUGHTER INTOWN WISHED AT LEAST THAT MRS. VIGO SHOULD BE WRITTEN TO ANDINVITED TO ACCEPT THE OFFICE OF COMPANION TO MRS. CASAUBON IT WAS NOTCREDIBLE THAT DOROTHEA AS A YOUNG WIDOW WOULD THINK OF LIVING ALONE INTHE HOUSE AT LOWICK. MRS. VIGO HAD BEEN READER AND SECRETARY TO ROYALPERSONAGES AND IN POINT OF KNOWLEDGE AND SENTIMENTS EVEN DOROTHEACOULD HAVE NOTHING TO OBJECT TO HER.MRS. CADWALLADER SAID PRIVATELY YOU WILL CERTAINLY GO MAD IN THATHOUSE ALONE MY DEAR. YOU WILL SEE VISIONS. WE HAVE ALL GOT TO EXERTOURSELVES A LITTLE TO KEEP SANE AND CALL THINGS BY THE SAME NAMES ASOTHER PEOPLE CALL THEM BY. TO BE SURE FOR YOUNGER SONS AND WOMEN WHOHAVE NO MONEY IT IS A SORT OF PROVISION TO GO MAD THEY ARE TAKEN CAREOF THEN. BUT YOU MUST NOT RUN INTO THAT. I DARE SAY YOU ARE A LITTLEBORED HERE WITH OUR GOOD DOWAGER BUT THINK WHAT A BORE YOU MIGHTBECOME YOURSELF TO YOUR FELLOWCREATURES IF YOU WERE ALWAYS PLAYINGTRAGEDY QUEEN AND TAKING THINGS SUBLIMELY. SITTING ALONE IN THATLIBRARY AT LOWICK YOU MAY FANCY YOURSELF RULING THE WEATHER YOU MUSTGET A FEW PEOPLE ROUND YOU WHO WOULDNT BELIEVE YOU IF YOU TOLD THEM.THAT IS A GOOD LOWERING MEDICINE.I NEVER CALLED EVERYTHING BY THE SAME NAME THAT ALL THE PEOPLE ABOUTME DID SAID DOROTHEA STOUTLY.BUT I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE FOUND OUT YOUR MISTAKE MY DEAR SAID MRS.CADWALLADER AND THAT IS A PROOF OF SANITY.DOROTHEA WAS AWARE OF THE STING BUT IT DID NOT HURT HER. NO SHESAID I STILL THINK THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE WORLD IS MISTAKENABOUT MANY THINGS. SURELY ONE MAY BE SANE AND YET THINK SO SINCE THEGREATER PART OF THE WORLD HAS OFTEN HAD TO COME ROUND FROM ITSOPINION.MRS. CADWALLADER SAID NO MORE ON THAT POINT TO DOROTHEA BUT TO HERHUSBAND SHE REMARKED IT WILL BE WELL FOR HER TO MARRY AGAIN AS SOONAS IT IS PROPER IF ONE COULD GET HER AMONG THE RIGHT PEOPLE. OF COURSETHE CHETTAMS WOULD NOT WISH IT. BUT I SEE CLEARLY A HUSBAND IS THE BESTTHING TO KEEP HER IN ORDER. IF WE WERE NOT SO POOR I WOULD INVITE LORDTRITON. HE WILL BE MARQUIS SOME DAY AND THERE IS NO DENYING THAT SHEWOULD MAKE A GOOD MARCHIONESS SHE LOOKS HANDSOMER THAN EVER IN HERMOURNING.MY DEAR ELINOR DO LET THE POOR WOMAN ALONE. SUCH CONTRIVANCES ARE OFNO USE SAID THE EASY RECTOR.NO USE HOW ARE MATCHES MADE EXCEPT BY BRINGING MEN AND WOMENTOGETHER AND IT IS A SHAME THAT HER UNCLE SHOULD HAVE RUN AWAY ANDSHUT UP THE GRANGE JUST NOW. THERE OUGHT TO BE PLENTY OF ELIGIBLEMATCHES INVITED TO FRESHITT AND THE GRANGE. LORD TRITON IS PRECISELYTHE MAN FULL OF PLANS FOR MAKING THE PEOPLE HAPPY IN A SOFTHEADEDSORT OF WAY. THAT WOULD JUST SUIT MRS. CASAUBON.LET MRS. CASAUBON CHOOSE FOR HERSELF ELINOR.THAT IS THE NONSENSE YOU WISE MEN TALK HOW CAN SHE CHOOSE IF SHE HASNO VARIETY TO CHOOSE FROM A WOMANS CHOICE USUALLY MEANS TAKING THEONLY MAN SHE CAN GET. MARK MY WORDS HUMPHREY. IF HER FRIENDS DONTEXERT THEMSELVES THERE WILL BE A WORSE BUSINESS THAN THE CASAUBONBUSINESS YET.FOR HEAVENS SAKE DONT TOUCH ON THAT TOPIC ELINOR IT IS A VERY SOREPOINT WITH SIR JAMES. HE WOULD BE DEEPLY OFFENDED IF YOU ENTERED ON ITTO HIM UNNECESSARILY.I HAVE NEVER ENTERED ON IT SAID MRS CADWALLADER OPENING HER HANDS.CELIA TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THE WILL AT THE BEGINNING WITHOUT ANY ASKINGOF MINE.YES YES BUT THEY WANT THE THING HUSHED UP AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THEYOUNG FELLOW IS GOING OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.MRS. CADWALLADER SAID NOTHING BUT GAVE HER HUSBAND THREE SIGNIFICANTNODS WITH A VERY SARCASTIC EXPRESSION IN HER DARK EYES.DOROTHEA QUIETLY PERSISTED IN SPITE OF REMONSTRANCE AND PERSUASION. SOBY THE END OF JUNE THE SHUTTERS WERE ALL OPENED AT LOWICK MANOR ANDTHE MORNING GAZED CALMLY INTO THE LIBRARY SHINING ON THE ROWS OFNOTEBOOKS AS IT SHINES ON THE WEARY WASTE PLANTED WITH HUGE STONESTHE MUTE MEMORIAL OF A FORGOTTEN FAITH AND THE EVENING LADEN WITHROSES ENTERED SILENTLY INTO THE BLUEGREEN BOUDOIR WHERE DOROTHEA CHOSEOFTENEST TO SIT. AT FIRST SHE WALKED INTO EVERY ROOM QUESTIONING THEEIGHTEEN MONTHS OF HER MARRIED LIFE AND CARRYING ON HER THOUGHTS AS IFTHEY WERE A SPEECH TO BE HEARD BY HER HUSBAND. THEN SHE LINGERED INTHE LIBRARY AND COULD NOT BE AT REST TILL SHE HAD CAREFULLY RANGED ALLTHE NOTEBOOKS AS SHE IMAGINED THAT HE WOULD WISH TO SEE THEM INORDERLY SEQUENCE. THE PITY WHICH HAD BEEN THE RESTRAINING COMPELLINGMOTIVE IN HER LIFE WITH HIM STILL CLUNG ABOUT HIS IMAGE EVEN WHILE SHEREMONSTRATED WITH HIM IN INDIGNANT THOUGHT AND TOLD HIM THAT HE WASUNJUST. ONE LITTLE ACT OF HERS MAY PERHAPS BE SMILED AT ASSUPERSTITIOUS. THE SYNOPTICAL TABULATION FOR THE USE OF MRS. CASAUBONSHE CAREFULLY ENCLOSED AND SEALED WRITING WITHIN THE ENVELOPE ICOULD NOT USE IT. DO YOU NOT SEE NOW THAT I COULD NOT SUBMIT MY SOUL TOYOURS BY WORKING HOPELESSLY AT WHAT I HAVE NO BELIEF INDOROTHEATHEN SHE DEPOSITED THE PAPER IN HER OWN DESK.THAT SILENT COLLOQUY WAS PERHAPS ONLY THE MORE EARNEST BECAUSEUNDERNEATH AND THROUGH IT ALL THERE WAS ALWAYS THE DEEP LONGING WHICHHAD REALLY DETERMINED HER TO COME TO LOWICK. THE LONGING WAS TO SEEWILL LADISLAW. SHE DID NOT KNOW ANY GOOD THAT COULD COME OF THEIRMEETING SHE WAS HELPLESS HER HANDS HAD BEEN TIED FROM MAKING UP TOHIM FOR ANY UNFAIRNESS IN HIS LOT. BUT HER SOUL THIRSTED TO SEE HIM.HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE IF A PRINCESS IN THE DAYS OF ENCHANTMENT HADSEEN A FOURFOOTED CREATURE FROM AMONG THOSE WHICH LIVE IN HERDS COMETO HER ONCE AND AGAIN WITH A HUMAN GAZE WHICH RESTED UPON HER WITHCHOICE AND BESEECHING WHAT WOULD SHE THINK OF IN HER JOURNEYING WHATWOULD SHE LOOK FOR WHEN THE HERDS PASSED HER SURELY FOR THE GAZE WHICHHAD FOUND HER AND WHICH SHE WOULD KNOW AGAIN. LIFE WOULD BE NO BETTERTHAN CANDLELIGHT TINSEL AND DAYLIGHT RUBBISH IF OUR SPIRITS WERE NOTTOUCHED BY WHAT HAS BEEN TO ISSUES OF LONGING AND CONSTANCY. IT WASTRUE THAT DOROTHEA WANTED TO KNOW THE FAREBROTHERS BETTER ANDESPECIALLY TO TALK TO THE NEW RECTOR BUT ALSO TRUE THAT REMEMBERINGWHAT LYDGATE HAD TOLD HER ABOUT WILL LADISLAW AND LITTLE MISS NOBLESHE COUNTED ON WILLS COMING TO LOWICK TO SEE THE FAREBROTHER FAMILY.THE VERY FIRST SUNDAY BEFORE SHE ENTERED THE CHURCH SHE SAW HIM ASSHE HAD SEEN HIM THE LAST TIME SHE WAS THERE ALONE IN THE CLERGYMANSPEW BUT WHEN SHE ENTERED HIS FIGURE WAS GONE.IN THE WEEKDAYS WHEN SHE WENT TO SEE THE LADIES AT THE RECTORY SHELISTENED IN VAIN FOR SOME WORD THAT THEY MIGHT LET FALL ABOUT WILL BUTIT SEEMED TO HER THAT MRS. FAREBROTHER TALKED OF EVERY ONE ELSE IN THENEIGHBORHOOD AND OUT OF IT.PROBABLY SOME OF MR. FAREBROTHERS MIDDLEMARCH HEARERS MAY FOLLOW HIMTO LOWICK SOMETIMES. DO YOU NOT THINK SO SAID DOROTHEA RATHERDESPISING HERSELF FOR HAVING A SECRET MOTIVE IN ASKING THE QUESTION.IF THEY ARE WISE THEY WILL MRS. CASAUBON SAID THE OLD LADY. I SEETHAT YOU SET A RIGHT VALUE ON MY SONS PREACHING. HIS GRANDFATHER ON MYSIDE WAS AN EXCELLENT CLERGYMAN BUT HIS FATHER WAS IN THE LAWMOSTEXEMPLARY AND HONEST NEVERTHELESS WHICH IS A REASON FOR OUR NEVERBEING RICH. THEY SAY FORTUNE IS A WOMAN AND CAPRICIOUS. BUT SOMETIMESSHE IS A GOOD WOMAN AND GIVES TO THOSE WHO MERIT WHICH HAS BEEN THECASE WITH YOU MRS. CASAUBON WHO HAVE GIVEN A LIVING TO MY SON.MRS. FAREBROTHER RECURRED TO HER KNITTING WITH A DIGNIFIED SATISFACTIONIN HER NEAT LITTLE EFFORT AT ORATORY BUT THIS WAS NOT WHAT DOROTHEAWANTED TO HEAR. POOR THING SHE DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHETHER WILL LADISLAWWAS STILL AT MIDDLEMARCH AND THERE WAS NO ONE WHOM SHE DARED TO ASKUNLESS IT WERE LYDGATE. BUT JUST NOW SHE COULD NOT SEE LYDGATE WITHOUTSENDING FOR HIM OR GOING TO SEEK HIM. PERHAPS WILL LADISLAW HAVINGHEARD OF THAT STRANGE BAN AGAINST HIM LEFT BY MR. CASAUBON HAD FELT ITBETTER THAT HE AND SHE SHOULD NOT MEET AGAIN AND PERHAPS SHE WAS WRONGTO WISH FOR A MEETING THAT OTHERS MIGHT FIND MANY GOOD REASONS AGAINST.STILL I DO WISH IT CAME AT THE END OF THOSE WISE REFLECTIONS ASNATURALLY AS A SOB AFTER HOLDING THE BREATH. AND THE MEETING DIDHAPPEN BUT IN A FORMAL WAY QUITE UNEXPECTED BY HER.ONE MORNING ABOUT ELEVEN DOROTHEA WAS SEATED IN HER BOUDOIR WITH AMAP OF THE LAND ATTACHED TO THE MANOR AND OTHER PAPERS BEFORE HERWHICH WERE TO HELP HER IN MAKING AN EXACT STATEMENT FOR HERSELF OF HERINCOME AND AFFAIRS. SHE HAD NOT YET APPLIED HERSELF TO HER WORK BUTWAS SEATED WITH HER HANDS FOLDED ON HER LAP LOOKING OUT ALONG THEAVENUE OF LIMES TO THE DISTANT FIELDS. EVERY LEAF WAS AT REST IN THESUNSHINE THE FAMILIAR SCENE WAS CHANGELESS AND SEEMED TO REPRESENTTHE PROSPECT OF HER LIFE FULL OF MOTIVELESS EASEMOTIVELESS IF HEROWN ENERGY COULD NOT SEEK OUT REASONS FOR ARDENT ACTION. THE WIDOWSCAP OF THOSE TIMES MADE AN OVAL FRAME FOR THE FACE AND HAD A CROWNSTANDING UP THE DRESS WAS AN EXPERIMENT IN THE UTMOST LAYING ON OFCRAPE BUT THIS HEAVY SOLEMNITY OF CLOTHING MADE HER FACE LOOK ALL THEYOUNGER WITH ITS RECOVERED BLOOM AND THE SWEET INQUIRING CANDOR OFHER EYES.HER REVERIE WAS BROKEN BY TANTRIPP WHO CAME TO SAY THAT MR. LADISLAWWAS BELOW AND BEGGED PERMISSION TO SEE MADAM IF IT WERE NOT TOO EARLY.I WILL SEE HIM SAID DOROTHEA RISING IMMEDIATELY. LET HIM BE SHOWNINTO THE DRAWINGROOM.THE DRAWINGROOM WAS THE MOST NEUTRAL ROOM IN THE HOUSE TO HERTHE ONELEAST ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRIALS OF HER MARRIED LIFE THE DAMASKMATCHED THE WOODWORK WHICH WAS ALL WHITE AND GOLD THERE WERE TWOTALL MIRRORS AND TABLES WITH NOTHING ON THEMIN BRIEF IT WAS A ROOMWHERE YOU HAD NO REASON FOR SITTING IN ONE PLACE RATHER THAN INANOTHER. IT WAS BELOW THE BOUDOIR AND HAD ALSO A BOWWINDOW LOOKINGOUT ON THE AVENUE. BUT WHEN PRATT SHOWED WILL LADISLAW INTO IT THEWINDOW WAS OPEN AND A WINGED VISITOR BUZZING IN AND OUT NOW AND THENWITHOUT MINDING THE FURNITURE MADE THE ROOM LOOK LESS FORMAL ANDUNINHABITED.GLAD TO SEE YOU HERE AGAIN SIR SAID PRATT LINGERING TO ADJUST ABLIND.I AM ONLY COME TO SAY GOODBY PRATT SAID WILL WHO WISHED EVEN THEBUTLER TO KNOW THAT HE WAS TOO PROUD TO HANG ABOUT MRS. CASAUBON NOWSHE WAS A RICH WIDOW.VERY SORRY TO HEAR IT SIR SAID PRATT RETIRING. OF COURSE AS ASERVANT WHO WAS TO BE TOLD NOTHING HE KNEW THE FACT OF WHICH LADISLAWWAS STILL IGNORANT AND HAD DRAWN HIS INFERENCES INDEED HAD NOTDIFFERED FROM HIS BETROTHED TANTRIPP WHEN SHE SAID YOUR MASTER WAS ASJEALOUS AS A FIENDAND NO REASON. MADAM WOULD LOOK HIGHER THAN MR.LADISLAW ELSE I DONT KNOW HER. MRS. CADWALLADERS MAID SAYS THERES ALORD COMING WHO IS TO MARRY HER WHEN THE MOURNINGS OVER.THERE WERE NOT MANY MOMENTS FOR WILL TO WALK ABOUT WITH HIS HAT IN HISHAND BEFORE DOROTHEA ENTERED. THE MEETING WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THATFIRST MEETING IN ROME WHEN WILL HAD BEEN EMBARRASSED AND DOROTHEA CALM.THIS TIME HE FELT MISERABLE BUT DETERMINED WHILE SHE WAS IN A STATE OFAGITATION WHICH COULD NOT BE HIDDEN. JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR SHE HAD FELTTHAT THIS LONGEDFOR MEETING WAS AFTER ALL TOO DIFFICULT AND WHEN SHESAW WILL ADVANCING TOWARDS HER THE DEEP BLUSH WHICH WAS RARE IN HERCAME WITH PAINFUL SUDDENNESS. NEITHER OF THEM KNEW HOW IT WAS BUTNEITHER OF THEM SPOKE. SHE GAVE HER HAND FOR A MOMENT AND THEN THEYWENT TO SIT DOWN NEAR THE WINDOW SHE ON ONE SETTEE AND HE ON ANOTHEROPPOSITE. WILL WAS PECULIARLY UNEASY IT SEEMED TO HIM NOT LIKEDOROTHEA THAT THE MERE FACT OF HER BEING A WIDOW SHOULD CAUSE SUCH ACHANGE IN HER MANNER OF RECEIVING HIM AND HE KNEW OF NO OTHERCONDITION WHICH COULD HAVE AFFECTED THEIR PREVIOUS RELATION TO EACHOTHEREXCEPT THAT AS HIS IMAGINATION AT ONCE TOLD HIM HER FRIENDSMIGHT HAVE BEEN POISONING HER MIND WITH THEIR SUSPICIONS OF HIM.I HOPE I HAVE NOT PRESUMED TOO MUCH IN CALLING SAID WILL I COULDNOT BEAR TO LEAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND BEGIN A NEW LIFE WITHOUT SEEINGYOU TO SAY GOODBY.PRESUMED SURELY NOT. I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT UNKIND IF YOU HAD NOTWISHED TO SEE ME SAID DOROTHEA HER HABIT OF SPEAKING WITH PERFECTGENUINENESS ASSERTING ITSELF THROUGH ALL HER UNCERTAINTY AND AGITATION.ARE YOU GOING AWAY IMMEDIATELYVERY SOON I THINK. I INTEND TO GO TO TOWN AND EAT MY DINNERS AS ABARRISTER SINCE THEY SAY THAT IS THE PREPARATION FOR ALL PUBLICBUSINESS. THERE WILL BE A GREAT DEAL OF POLITICAL WORK TO BE DONEBYANDBY AND I MEAN TO TRY AND DO SOME OF IT. OTHER MEN HAVE MANAGEDTO WIN AN HONORABLE POSITION FOR THEMSELVES WITHOUT FAMILY OR MONEY.AND THAT WILL MAKE IT ALL THE MORE HONORABLE SAID DOROTHEAARDENTLY. BESIDES YOU HAVE SO MANY TALENTS. I HAVE HEARD FROM MYUNCLE HOW WELL YOU SPEAK IN PUBLIC SO THAT EVERY ONE IS SORRY WHEN YOULEAVE OFF AND HOW CLEARLY YOU CAN EXPLAIN THINGS. AND YOU CARE THATJUSTICE SHOULD BE DONE TO EVERY ONE. I AM SO GLAD. WHEN WE WERE INROME I THOUGHT YOU ONLY CARED FOR POETRY AND ART AND THE THINGS THATADORN LIFE FOR US WHO ARE WELL OFF. BUT NOW I KNOW YOU THINK ABOUT THEREST OF THE WORLD.WHILE SHE WAS SPEAKING DOROTHEA HAD LOST HER PERSONAL EMBARRASSMENTAND HAD BECOME LIKE HER FORMER SELF. SHE LOOKED AT WILL WITH A DIRECTGLANCE FULL OF DELIGHTED CONFIDENCE.YOU APPROVE OF MY GOING AWAY FOR YEARS THEN AND NEVER COMING HEREAGAIN TILL I HAVE MADE MYSELF OF SOME MARK IN THE WORLD SAID WILLTRYING HARD TO RECONCILE THE UTMOST PRIDE WITH THE UTMOST EFFORT TO GETAN EXPRESSION OF STRONG FEELING FROM DOROTHEA.SHE WAS NOT AWARE HOW LONG IT WAS BEFORE SHE ANSWERED. SHE HAD TURNEDHER HEAD AND WAS LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW ON THE ROSEBUSHES WHICHSEEMED TO HAVE IN THEM THE SUMMERS OF ALL THE YEARS WHEN WILL WOULD BEAWAY. THIS WAS NOT JUDICIOUS BEHAVIOR. BUT DOROTHEA NEVER THOUGHT OFSTUDYING HER MANNERS SHE THOUGHT ONLY OF BOWING TO A SAD NECESSITYWHICH DIVIDED HER FROM WILL. THOSE FIRST WORDS OF HIS ABOUT HISINTENTIONS HAD SEEMED TO MAKE EVERYTHING CLEAR TO HER HE KNEW SHESUPPOSED ALL ABOUT MR. CASAUBONS FINAL CONDUCT IN RELATION TO HIMAND IT HAD COME TO HIM WITH THE SAME SORT OF SHOCK AS TO HERSELF. HEHAD NEVER FELT MORE THAN FRIENDSHIP FOR HERHAD NEVER HAD ANYTHING INHIS MIND TO JUSTIFY WHAT SHE FELT TO BE HER HUSBANDS OUTRAGE ON THEFEELINGS OF BOTH AND THAT FRIENDSHIP HE STILL FELT. SOMETHING WHICHMAY BE CALLED AN INWARD SILENT SOB HAD GONE ON IN DOROTHEA BEFORE SHESAID WITH A PURE VOICE JUST TREMBLING IN THE LAST WORDS AS IF ONLYFROM ITS LIQUID FLEXIBILITYYES IT MUST BE RIGHT FOR YOU TO DO AS YOU SAY. I SHALL BE VERY HAPPYWHEN I HEAR THAT YOU HAVE MADE YOUR VALUE FELT. BUT YOU MUST HAVEPATIENCE. IT WILL PERHAPS BE A LONG WHILE.WILL NEVER QUITE KNEW HOW IT WAS THAT HE SAVED HIMSELF FROM FALLINGDOWN AT HER FEET WHEN THE LONG WHILE CAME FORTH WITH ITS GENTLETREMOR. HE USED TO SAY THAT THE HORRIBLE HUE AND SURFACE OF HER CRAPEDRESS WAS MOST LIKELY THE SUFFICIENT CONTROLLING FORCE. HE SAT STILLHOWEVER AND ONLY SAIDI SHALL NEVER HEAR FROM YOU. AND YOU WILL FORGET ALL ABOUT ME.NO SAID DOROTHEA I SHALL NEVER FORGET YOU. I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTENANY ONE WHOM I ONCE KNEW. MY LIFE HAS NEVER BEEN CROWDED AND SEEMS NOTLIKELY TO BE SO. AND I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF SPACE FOR MEMORY AT LOWICKHAVENT I SHE SMILED.GOOD GOD WILL BURST OUT PASSIONATELY RISING WITH HIS HAT STILL INHIS HAND AND WALKING AWAY TO A MARBLE TABLE WHERE HE SUDDENLY TURNEDAND LEANED HIS BACK AGAINST IT. THE BLOOD HAD MOUNTED TO HIS FACE ANDNECK AND HE LOOKED ALMOST ANGRY. IT HAD SEEMED TO HIM AS IF THEY WERELIKE TWO CREATURES SLOWLY TURNING TO MARBLE IN EACH OTHERS PRESENCEWHILE THEIR HEARTS WERE CONSCIOUS AND THEIR EYES WERE YEARNING. BUTTHERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT. IT SHOULD NEVER BE TRUE OF HIM THAT IN THISMEETING TO WHICH HE HAD COME WITH BITTER RESOLUTION HE HAD ENDED BY ACONFESSION WHICH MIGHT BE INTERPRETED INTO ASKING FOR HER FORTUNE.MOREOVER IT WAS ACTUALLY TRUE THAT HE WAS FEARFUL OF THE EFFECT WHICHSUCH CONFESSIONS MIGHT HAVE ON DOROTHEA HERSELF.SHE LOOKED AT HIM FROM THAT DISTANCE IN SOME TROUBLE IMAGINING THATTHERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN OFFENCE IN HER WORDS. BUT ALL THE WHILE THEREWAS A CURRENT OF THOUGHT IN HER ABOUT HIS PROBABLE WANT OF MONEY ANDTHE IMPOSSIBILITY OF HER HELPING HIM. IF HER UNCLE HAD BEEN AT HOMESOMETHING MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE THROUGH HIM IT WAS THIS PREOCCUPATIONWITH THE HARDSHIP OF WILLS WANTING MONEY WHILE SHE HAD WHAT OUGHT TOHAVE BEEN HIS SHARE WHICH LED HER TO SAY SEEING THAT HE REMAINEDSILENT AND LOOKED AWAY FROM HERI WONDER WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT MINIATURE WHICH HANGSUPSTAIRSI MEAN THAT BEAUTIFUL MINIATURE OF YOUR GRANDMOTHER. I THINKIT IS NOT RIGHT FOR ME TO KEEP IT IF YOU WOULD WISH TO HAVE IT. IT ISWONDERFULLY LIKE YOU.YOU ARE VERY GOOD SAID WILL IRRITABLY. NO I DONT MIND ABOUT IT.IT IS NOT VERY CONSOLING TO HAVE ONES OWN LIKENESS. IT WOULD BE MORECONSOLING IF OTHERS WANTED TO HAVE IT.I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHERISH HER MEMORYI THOUGHT DOROTHEABROKE OFF AN INSTANT HER IMAGINATION SUDDENLY WARNING HER AWAY FROMAUNT JULIAS HISTORYYOU WOULD SURELY LIKE TO HAVE THE MINIATURE AS AFAMILY MEMORIAL.WHY SHOULD I HAVE THAT WHEN I HAVE NOTHING ELSE A MAN WITH ONLY APORTMANTEAU FOR HIS STOWAGE MUST KEEP HIS MEMORIALS IN HIS HEAD.WILL SPOKE AT RANDOM HE WAS MERELY VENTING HIS PETULANCE IT WAS ALITTLE TOO EXASPERATING TO HAVE HIS GRANDMOTHERS PORTRAIT OFFERED HIMAT THAT MOMENT. BUT TO DOROTHEAS FEELING HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIARSTING. SHE ROSE AND SAID WITH A TOUCH OF INDIGNATION AS WELL ASHAUTEURYOU ARE MUCH THE HAPPIER OF US TWO MR. LADISLAW TO HAVE NOTHING.WILL WAS STARTLED. WHATEVER THE WORDS MIGHT BE THE TONE SEEMED LIKE ADISMISSAL AND QUITTING HIS LEANING POSTURE HE WALKED A LITTLE WAYTOWARDS HER. THEIR EYES MET BUT WITH A STRANGE QUESTIONING GRAVITY.SOMETHING WAS KEEPING THEIR MINDS ALOOF AND EACH WAS LEFT TOCONJECTURE WHAT WAS IN THE OTHER. WILL HAD REALLY NEVER THOUGHT OFHIMSELF AS HAVING A CLAIM OF INHERITANCE ON THE PROPERTY WHICH WAS HELDBY DOROTHEA AND WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A NARRATIVE TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTANDHER PRESENT FEELING.I NEVER FELT IT A MISFORTUNE TO HAVE NOTHING TILL NOW HE SAID. BUTPOVERTY MAY BE AS BAD AS LEPROSY IF IT DIVIDES US FROM WHAT WE MOSTCARE FOR.THE WORDS CUT DOROTHEA TO THE HEART AND MADE HER RELENT. SHE ANSWEREDIN A TONE OF SAD FELLOWSHIP.SORROW COMES IN SO MANY WAYS. TWO YEARS AGO I HAD NO NOTION OF THATIMEAN OF THE UNEXPECTED WAY IN WHICH TROUBLE COMES AND TIES OUR HANDSAND MAKES US SILENT WHEN WE LONG TO SPEAK. I USED TO DESPISE WOMEN ALITTLE FOR NOT SHAPING THEIR LIVES MORE AND DOING BETTER THINGS. I WASVERY FOND OF DOING AS I LIKED BUT I HAVE ALMOST GIVEN IT UP SHEENDED SMILING PLAYFULLY.I HAVE NOT GIVEN UP DOING AS I LIKE BUT I CAN VERY SELDOM DO ITSAID WILL. HE WAS STANDING TWO YARDS FROM HER WITH HIS MIND FULL OFCONTRADICTORY DESIRES AND RESOLVESDESIRING SOME UNMISTAKABLE PROOFTHAT SHE LOVED HIM AND YET DREADING THE POSITION INTO WHICH SUCH APROOF MIGHT BRING HIM. THE THING ONE MOST LONGS FOR MAY BE SURROUNDEDWITH CONDITIONS THAT WOULD BE INTOLERABLE.AT THIS MOMENT PRATT ENTERED AND SAID SIR JAMES CHETTAM IS IN THELIBRARY MADAM.ASK SIR JAMES TO COME IN HERE SAID DOROTHEA IMMEDIATELY. IT WAS ASIF THE SAME ELECTRIC SHOCK HAD PASSED THROUGH HER AND WILL. EACH OFTHEM FELT PROUDLY RESISTANT AND NEITHER LOOKED AT THE OTHER WHILETHEY AWAITED SIR JAMESS ENTRANCE.AFTER SHAKING HANDS WITH DOROTHEA HE BOWED AS SLIGHTLY AS POSSIBLE TOLADISLAW WHO REPAID THE SLIGHTNESS EXACTLY AND THEN GOING TOWARDSDOROTHEA SAIDI MUST SAY GOODBY MRS. CASAUBON AND PROBABLY FOR A LONG WHILE.DOROTHEA PUT OUT HER HAND AND SAID HER GOODBY CORDIALLY. THE SENSETHAT SIR JAMES WAS DEPRECIATING WILL AND BEHAVING RUDELY TO HIMROUSED HER RESOLUTION AND DIGNITY THERE WAS NO TOUCH OF CONFUSION INHER MANNER. AND WHEN WILL HAD LEFT THE ROOM SHE LOOKED WITH SUCH CALMSELFPOSSESSION AT SIR JAMES SAYING HOW IS CELIA THAT HE WASOBLIGED TO BEHAVE AS IF NOTHING HAD ANNOYED HIM. AND WHAT WOULD BE THEUSE OF BEHAVING OTHERWISE INDEED SIR JAMES SHRANK WITH SO MUCHDISLIKE FROM THE ASSOCIATION EVEN IN THOUGHT OF DOROTHEA WITH LADISLAWAS HER POSSIBLE LOVER THAT HE WOULD HIMSELF HAVE WISHED TO AVOID ANOUTWARD SHOW OF DISPLEASURE WHICH WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THEDISAGREEABLE POSSIBILITY. IF ANY ONE HAD ASKED HIM WHY HE SHRANK INTHAT WAY I AM NOT SURE THAT HE WOULD AT FIRST HAVE SAID ANYTHINGFULLER OR MORE PRECISE THAN THAT LADISLAWTHOUGH ON REFLECTION HEMIGHT HAVE URGED THAT MR. CASAUBONS CODICIL BARRING DOROTHEASMARRIAGE WITH WILL EXCEPT UNDER A PENALTY WAS ENOUGH TO CASTUNFITNESS OVER ANY RELATION AT ALL BETWEEN THEM. HIS AVERSION WAS ALLTHE STRONGER BECAUSE HE FELT HIMSELF UNABLE TO INTERFERE.BUT SIR JAMES WAS A POWER IN A WAY UNGUESSED BY HIMSELF. ENTERING ATTHAT MOMENT HE WAS AN INCORPORATION OF THE STRONGEST REASONS THROUGHWHICH WILLS PRIDE BECAME A REPELLENT FORCE KEEPING HIM ASUNDER FROMDOROTHEA.CHAPTER LV.HATH SHE HER FAULTS I WOULD YOU HAD THEM TOO.THEY ARE THE FRUITY MUST OF SOUNDEST WINEOR SAY THEY ARE REGENERATING FIRESUCH AS HATH TURNED THE DENSE BLACK ELEMENTINTO A CRYSTAL PATHWAY FOR THE SUN.IF YOUTH IS THE SEASON OF HOPE IT IS OFTEN SO ONLY IN THE SENSE THATOUR ELDERS ARE HOPEFUL ABOUT US FOR NO AGE IS SO APT AS YOUTH TO THINKITS EMOTIONS PARTINGS AND RESOLVES ARE THE LAST OF THEIR KIND. EACHCRISIS SEEMS FINAL SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS NEW. WE ARE TOLD THAT THEOLDEST INHABITANTS IN PERU DO NOT CEASE TO BE AGITATED BY THEEARTHQUAKES BUT THEY PROBABLY SEE BEYOND EACH SHOCK AND REFLECT THATTHERE ARE PLENTY MORE TO COME.TO DOROTHEA STILL IN THAT TIME OF YOUTH WHEN THE EYES WITH THEIR LONGFULL LASHES LOOK OUT AFTER THEIR RAIN OF TEARS UNSOILED AND UNWEARIEDAS A FRESHLY OPENED PASSIONFLOWER THAT MORNINGS PARTING WITH WILLLADISLAW SEEMED TO BE THE CLOSE OF THEIR PERSONAL RELATIONS. HE WASGOING AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE OF UNKNOWN YEARS AND IF EVER HE CAME BACKHE WOULD BE ANOTHER MAN. THE ACTUAL STATE OF HIS MINDHIS PROUD RESOLVETO GIVE THE LIE BEFOREHAND TO ANY SUSPICION THAT HE WOULD PLAY THENEEDY ADVENTURER SEEKING A RICH WOMANLAY QUITE OUT OF HER IMAGINATIONAND SHE HAD INTERPRETED ALL HIS BEHAVIOR EASILY ENOUGH BY HERSUPPOSITION THAT MR. CASAUBONS CODICIL SEEMED TO HIM AS IT DID TOHER A GROSS AND CRUEL INTERDICT ON ANY ACTIVE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THEM.THEIR YOUNG DELIGHT IN SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER AND SAYING WHAT NO ONEELSE WOULD CARE TO HEAR WAS FOREVER ENDED AND BECOME A TREASURE OFTHE PAST. FOR THIS VERY REASON SHE DWELT ON IT WITHOUT INWARD CHECK.THAT UNIQUE HAPPINESS TOO WAS DEAD AND IN ITS SHADOWED SILENT CHAMBERSHE MIGHT VENT THE PASSIONATE GRIEF WHICH SHE HERSELF WONDERED AT. FORTHE FIRST TIME SHE TOOK DOWN THE MINIATURE FROM THE WALL AND KEPT ITBEFORE HER LIKING TO BLEND THE WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN TOO HARDLY JUDGEDWITH THE GRANDSON WHOM HER OWN HEART AND JUDGMENT DEFENDED. CAN ANY ONEWHO HAS REJOICED IN WOMANS TENDERNESS THINK IT A REPROACH TO HER THATSHE TOOK THE LITTLE OVAL PICTURE IN HER PALM AND MADE A BED FOR ITTHERE AND LEANED HER CHEEK UPON IT AS IF THAT WOULD SOOTHE THECREATURES WHO HAD SUFFERED UNJUST CONDEMNATION SHE DID NOT KNOW THENTHAT IT WAS LOVE WHO HAD COME TO HER BRIEFLY AS IN A DREAM BEFOREAWAKING WITH THE HUES OF MORNING ON HIS WINGSTHAT IT WAS LOVE TO WHOMSHE WAS SOBBING HER FAREWELL AS HIS IMAGE WAS BANISHED BY THE BLAMELESSRIGOR OF IRRESISTIBLE DAY. SHE ONLY FELT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHINGIRREVOCABLY AMISS AND LOST IN HER LOT AND HER THOUGHTS ABOUT THEFUTURE WERE THE MORE READILY SHAPEN INTO RESOLVE. ARDENT SOULS READYTO CONSTRUCT THEIR COMING LIVES ARE APT TO COMMIT THEMSELVES TO THEFULFILMENT OF THEIR OWN VISIONS.ONE DAY THAT SHE WENT TO FRESHITT TO FULFIL HER PROMISE OF STAYING ALLNIGHT AND SEEING BABY WASHED MRS. CADWALLADER CAME TO DINE THE RECTORBEING GONE ON A FISHING EXCURSION. IT WAS A WARM EVENING AND EVEN INTHE DELIGHTFUL DRAWINGROOM WHERE THE FINE OLD TURF SLOPED FROM THEOPEN WINDOW TOWARDS A LILIED POOL AND WELLPLANTED MOUNDS THE HEAT WASENOUGH TO MAKE CELIA IN HER WHITE MUSLIN AND LIGHT CURLS REFLECT WITHPITY ON WHAT DODO MUST FEEL IN HER BLACK DRESS AND CLOSE CAP. BUT THISWAS NOT UNTIL SOME EPISODES WITH BABY WERE OVER AND HAD LEFT HER MINDAT LEISURE. SHE HAD SEATED HERSELF AND TAKEN UP A FAN FOR SOME TIMEBEFORE SHE SAID IN HER QUIET GUTTURALDEAR DODO DO THROW OFF THAT CAP. I AM SURE YOUR DRESS MUST MAKE YOUFEEL ILL.I AM SO USED TO THE CAPIT HAS BECOME A SORT OF SHELL SAID DOROTHEASMILING. I FEEL RATHER BARE AND EXPOSED WHEN IT IS OFF.I MUST SEE YOU WITHOUT IT IT MAKES US ALL WARM SAID CELIA THROWINGDOWN HER FAN AND GOING TO DOROTHEA. IT WAS A PRETTY PICTURE TO SEETHIS LITTLE LADY IN WHITE MUSLIN UNFASTENING THE WIDOWS CAP FROM HERMORE MAJESTIC SISTER AND TOSSING IT ON TO A CHAIR. JUST AS THE COILSAND BRAIDS OF DARKBROWN HAIR HAD BEEN SET FREE SIR JAMES ENTERED THEROOM. HE LOOKED AT THE RELEASED HEAD AND SAID AH IN A TONE OFSATISFACTION.IT WAS I WHO DID IT JAMES SAID CELIA. DODO NEED NOT MAKE SUCH ASLAVERY OF HER MOURNING SHE NEED NOT WEAR THAT CAP ANY MORE AMONG HERFRIENDS.MY DEAR CELIA SAID LADY CHETTAM A WIDOW MUST WEAR HER MOURNING ATLEAST A YEAR.NOT IF SHE MARRIES AGAIN BEFORE THE END OF IT SAID MRS. CADWALLADERWHO HAD SOME PLEASURE IN STARTLING HER GOOD FRIEND THE DOWAGER. SIRJAMES WAS ANNOYED AND LEANED FORWARD TO PLAY WITH CELIAS MALTESE DOG.THAT IS VERY RARE I HOPE SAID LADY CHETTAM IN A TONE INTENDED TOGUARD AGAINST SUCH EVENTS. NO FRIEND OF OURS EVER COMMITTED HERSELF INTHAT WAY EXCEPT MRS. BEEVOR AND IT WAS VERY PAINFUL TO LORD GRINSELLWHEN SHE DID SO. HER FIRST HUSBAND WAS OBJECTIONABLE WHICH MADE IT THEGREATER WONDER. AND SEVERELY SHE WAS PUNISHED FOR IT. THEY SAID CAPTAINBEEVOR DRAGGED HER ABOUT BY THE HAIR AND HELD UP LOADED PISTOLS ATHER.OH IF SHE TOOK THE WRONG MAN SAID MRS. CADWALLADER WHO WAS IN ADECIDEDLY WICKED MOOD. MARRIAGE IS ALWAYS BAD THEN FIRST OR SECOND.PRIORITY IS A POOR RECOMMENDATION IN A HUSBAND IF HE HAS GOT NO OTHER.I WOULD RATHER HAVE A GOOD SECOND HUSBAND THAN AN INDIFFERENT FIRST.MY DEAR YOUR CLEVER TONGUE RUNS AWAY WITH YOU SAID LADY CHETTAM. IAM SURE YOU WOULD BE THE LAST WOMAN TO MARRY AGAIN PREMATURELY IF OURDEAR RECTOR WERE TAKEN AWAY.OH I MAKE NO VOWS IT MIGHT BE A NECESSARY ECONOMY. IT IS LAWFUL TOMARRY AGAIN I SUPPOSE ELSE WE MIGHT AS WELL BE HINDOOS INSTEAD OFCHRISTIANS. OF COURSE IF A WOMAN ACCEPTS THE WRONG MAN SHE MUST TAKETHE CONSEQUENCES AND ONE WHO DOES IT TWICE OVER DESERVES HER FATE. BUTIF SHE CAN MARRY BLOOD BEAUTY AND BRAVERYTHE SOONER THE BETTER.I THINK THE SUBJECT OF OUR CONVERSATION IS VERY ILLCHOSEN SAID SIRJAMES WITH A LOOK OF DISGUST. SUPPOSE WE CHANGE IT.NOT ON MY ACCOUNT SIR JAMES SAID DOROTHEA DETERMINED NOT TO LOSETHE OPPORTUNITY OF FREEING HERSELF FROM CERTAIN OBLIQUE REFERENCES TOEXCELLENT MATCHES. IF YOU ARE SPEAKING ON MY BEHALF I CAN ASSURE YOUTHAT NO QUESTION CAN BE MORE INDIFFERENT AND IMPERSONAL TO ME THANSECOND MARRIAGE. IT IS NO MORE TO ME THAN IF YOU TALKED OF WOMEN GOINGFOXHUNTING WHETHER IT IS ADMIRABLE IN THEM OR NOT I SHALL NOT FOLLOWTHEM. PRAY LET MRS. CADWALLADER AMUSE HERSELF ON THAT SUBJECT AS MUCHAS ON ANY OTHER.MY DEAR MRS. CASAUBON SAID LADY CHETTAM IN HER STATELIEST WAY YOUDO NOT I HOPE THINK THERE WAS ANY ALLUSION TO YOU IN MY MENTIONINGMRS. BEEVOR. IT WAS ONLY AN INSTANCE THAT OCCURRED TO ME. SHE WASSTEPDAUGHTER TO LORD GRINSELL HE MARRIED MRS. TEVEROY FOR HIS SECONDWIFE. THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE ALLUSION TO YOU.OH NO SAID CELIA. NOBODY CHOSE THE SUBJECT IT ALL CAME OUT OFDODOS CAP. MRS. CADWALLADER ONLY SAID WHAT WAS QUITE TRUE. A WOMANCOULD NOT BE MARRIED IN A WIDOWS CAP JAMES.HUSH MY DEAR SAID MRS. CADWALLADER. I WILL NOT OFFEND AGAIN. IWILL NOT EVEN REFER TO DIDO OR ZENOBIA. ONLY WHAT ARE WE TO TALK ABOUTI FOR MY PART OBJECT TO THE DISCUSSION OF HUMAN NATURE BECAUSE THATIS THE NATURE OF RECTORS WIVES.LATER IN THE EVENING AFTER MRS. CADWALLADER WAS GONE CELIA SAIDPRIVATELY TO DOROTHEA REALLY DODO TAKING YOUR CAP OFF MADE YOU LIKEYOURSELF AGAIN IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE. YOU SPOKE UP JUST AS YOU USED TODO WHEN ANYTHING WAS SAID TO DISPLEASE YOU. BUT I COULD HARDLY MAKEOUT WHETHER IT WAS JAMES THAT YOU THOUGHT WRONG OR MRS. CADWALLADER.NEITHER SAID DOROTHEA. JAMES SPOKE OUT OF DELICACY TO ME BUT HEWAS MISTAKEN IN SUPPOSING THAT I MINDED WHAT MRS. CADWALLADER SAID. ISHOULD ONLY MIND IF THERE WERE A LAW OBLIGING ME TO TAKE ANY PIECE OFBLOOD AND BEAUTY THAT SHE OR ANYBODY ELSE RECOMMENDED.BUT YOU KNOW DODO IF YOU EVER DID MARRY IT WOULD BE ALL THE BETTERTO HAVE BLOOD AND BEAUTY SAID CELIA REFLECTING THAT MR. CASAUBON HADNOT BEEN RICHLY ENDOWED WITH THOSE GIFTS AND THAT IT WOULD BE WELL TOCAUTION DOROTHEA IN TIME.DONT BE ANXIOUS KITTY I HAVE QUITE OTHER THOUGHTS ABOUT MY LIFE. ISHALL NEVER MARRY AGAIN SAID DOROTHEA TOUCHING HER SISTERS CHINAND LOOKING AT HER WITH INDULGENT AFFECTION. CELIA WAS NURSING HERBABY AND DOROTHEA HAD COME TO SAY GOODNIGHT TO HER.REALLYQUITE SAID CELIA. NOT ANYBODY AT ALLIF HE WERE VERYWONDERFUL INDEEDDOROTHEA SHOOK HER HEAD SLOWLY. NOT ANYBODY AT ALL. I HAVE DELIGHTFULPLANS. I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE A GREAT DEAL OF LAND AND DRAIN IT ANDMAKE A LITTLE COLONY WHERE EVERYBODY SHOULD WORK AND ALL THE WORKSHOULD BE DONE WELL. I SHOULD KNOW EVERY ONE OF THE PEOPLE AND BE THEIRFRIEND. I AM GOING TO HAVE GREAT CONSULTATIONS WITH MR. GARTH HE CANTELL ME ALMOST EVERYTHING I WANT TO KNOW.THEN YOU WILL BE HAPPY IF YOU HAVE A PLAN DODO SAID CELIA.PERHAPS LITTLE ARTHUR WILL LIKE PLANS WHEN HE GROWS UP AND THEN HECAN HELP YOU.SIR JAMES WAS INFORMED THAT SAME NIGHT THAT DOROTHEA WAS REALLY QUITESET AGAINST MARRYING ANYBODY AT ALL AND WAS GOING TO TAKE TO ALLSORTS OF PLANS JUST LIKE WHAT SHE USED TO HAVE. SIR JAMES MADE NOREMARK. TO HIS SECRET FEELING THERE WAS SOMETHING REPULSIVE IN AWOMANS SECOND MARRIAGE AND NO MATCH WOULD PREVENT HIM FROM FEELING ITA SORT OF DESECRATION FOR DOROTHEA. HE WAS AWARE THAT THE WORLD WOULDREGARD SUCH A SENTIMENT AS PREPOSTEROUS ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO AWOMAN OF ONEANDTWENTY THE PRACTICE OF THE WORLD BEING TO TREAT OFA YOUNG WIDOWS SECOND MARRIAGE AS CERTAIN AND PROBABLY NEAR AND TOSMILE WITH MEANING IF THE WIDOW ACTS ACCORDINGLY. BUT IF DOROTHEA DIDCHOOSE TO ESPOUSE HER SOLITUDE HE FELT THAT THE RESOLUTION WOULD WELLBECOME HER.CHAPTER LVI.HOW HAPPY IS HE BORN AND TAUGHTTHAT SERVETH NOT ANOTHERS WILLWHOSE ARMOR IS HIS HONEST THOUGHTAND SIMPLE TRUTH HIS ONLY SKILL. . . . . . .THIS MAN IS FREED FROM SERVILE BANDSOF HOPE TO RISE OR FEAR TO FALLLORD OF HIMSELF THOUGH NOT OF LANDSAND HAVING NOTHING YET HATH ALL.SIR HENRY WOTTON.DOROTHEAS CONFIDENCE IN CALEB GARTHS KNOWLEDGE WHICH HAD BEGUN ONHER HEARING THAT HE APPROVED OF HER COTTAGES HAD GROWN FAST DURING HERSTAY AT FRESHITT SIR JAMES HAVING INDUCED HER TO TAKE RIDES OVER THETWO ESTATES IN COMPANY WITH HIMSELF AND CALEB WHO QUITE RETURNED HERADMIRATION AND TOLD HIS WIFE THAT MRS. CASAUBON HAD A HEAD FORBUSINESS MOST UNCOMMON IN A WOMAN. IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT BYBUSINESS CALEB NEVER MEANT MONEY TRANSACTIONS BUT THE SKILFULAPPLICATION OF LABOR.MOST UNCOMMON REPEATED CALEB. SHE SAID A THING I OFTEN USED TOTHINK MYSELF WHEN I WAS A LADMR. GARTH I SHOULD LIKE TO FEEL IF ILIVED TO BE OLD THAT I HAD IMPROVED A GREAT PIECE OF LAND AND BUILT AGREAT MANY GOOD COTTAGES BECAUSE THE WORK IS OF A HEALTHY KIND WHILEIT IS BEING DONE AND AFTER IT IS DONE MEN ARE THE BETTER FOR IT.THOSE WERE THE VERY WORDS SHE SEES INTO THINGS IN THAT WAY.BUT WOMANLY I HOPE SAID MRS. GARTH HALF SUSPECTING THAT MRS.CASAUBON MIGHT NOT HOLD THE TRUE PRINCIPLE OF SUBORDINATION.OH YOU CANT THINK SAID CALEB SHAKING HIS HEAD. YOU WOULD LIKE TOHEAR HER SPEAK SUSAN. SHE SPEAKS IN SUCH PLAIN WORDS AND A VOICE LIKEMUSIC. BLESS ME IT REMINDS ME OF BITS IN THE MESSIAHANDSTRAIGHTWAY THERE APPEARED A MULTITUDE OF THE HEAVENLY HOST PRAISINGGOD AND SAYING IT HAS A TONE WITH IT THAT SATISFIES YOUR EAR.CALEB WAS VERY FOND OF MUSIC AND WHEN HE COULD AFFORD IT WENT TO HEARAN ORATORIO THAT CAME WITHIN HIS REACH RETURNING FROM IT WITH APROFOUND REVERENCE FOR THIS MIGHTY STRUCTURE OF TONES WHICH MADE HIMSIT MEDITATIVELY LOOKING ON THE FLOOR AND THROWING MUCH UNUTTERABLELANGUAGE INTO HIS OUTSTRETCHED HANDS.WITH THIS GOOD UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THEM IT WAS NATURAL THAT DOROTHEAASKED MR. GARTH TO UNDERTAKE ANY BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH THE THREEFARMS AND THE NUMEROUS TENEMENTS ATTACHED TO LOWICK MANOR INDEED HISEXPECTATION OF GETTING WORK FOR TWO WAS BEING FAST FULFILLED. AS HESAID BUSINESS BREEDS. AND ONE FORM OF BUSINESS WHICH WAS BEGINNINGTO BREED JUST THEN WAS THE CONSTRUCTION OF RAILWAYS. A PROJECTED LINEWAS TO RUN THROUGH LOWICK PARISH WHERE THE CATTLE HAD HITHERTO GRAZEDIN A PEACE UNBROKEN BY ASTONISHMENT AND THUS IT HAPPENED THAT THEINFANT STRUGGLES OF THE RAILWAY SYSTEM ENTERED INTO THE AFFAIRS OFCALEB GARTH AND DETERMINED THE COURSE OF THIS HISTORY WITH REGARD TOTWO PERSONS WHO WERE DEAR TO HIM. THE SUBMARINE RAILWAY MAY HAVE ITSDIFFICULTIES BUT THE BED OF THE SEA IS NOT DIVIDED AMONG VARIOUSLANDED PROPRIETORS WITH CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES NOT ONLY MEASURABLE BUTSENTIMENTAL. IN THE HUNDRED TO WHICH MIDDLEMARCH BELONGED RAILWAYS WEREAS EXCITING A TOPIC AS THE REFORM BILL OR THE IMMINENT HORRORS OFCHOLERA AND THOSE WHO HELD THE MOST DECIDED VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT WEREWOMEN AND LANDHOLDERS. WOMEN BOTH OLD AND YOUNG REGARDED TRAVELLING BYSTEAM AS PRESUMPTUOUS AND DANGEROUS AND ARGUED AGAINST IT BY SAYINGTHAT NOTHING SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO GET INTO A RAILWAY CARRIAGE WHILEPROPRIETORS DIFFERING FROM EACH OTHER IN THEIR ARGUMENTS AS MUCH ASMR. SOLOMON FEATHERSTONE DIFFERED FROM LORD MEDLICOTE WERE YETUNANIMOUS IN THE OPINION THAT IN SELLING LAND WHETHER TO THE ENEMY OFMANKIND OR TO A COMPANY OBLIGED TO PURCHASE THESE PERNICIOUS AGENCIESMUST BE MADE TO PAY A VERY HIGH PRICE TO LANDOWNERS FOR PERMISSION TOINJURE MANKIND.BUT THE SLOWER WITS SUCH AS MR. SOLOMON AND MRS. WAULE WHO BOTHOCCUPIED LAND OF THEIR OWN TOOK A LONG TIME TO ARRIVE AT THISCONCLUSION THEIR MINDS HALTING AT THE VIVID CONCEPTION OF WHAT ITWOULD BE TO CUT THE BIG PASTURE IN TWO AND TURN IT INTO THREECORNEREDBITS WHICH WOULD BE NOHOW WHILE ACCOMMODATIONBRIDGES AND HIGHPAYMENTS WERE REMOTE AND INCREDIBLE.THE COWS WILL ALL CAST THEIR CALVES BROTHER SAID MRS. WAULE IN ATONE OF DEEP MELANCHOLY IF THE RAILWAY COMES ACROSS THE NEAR CLOSEAND I SHOULDNT WONDER AT THE MARE TOO IF SHE WAS IN FOAL. ITS A POORTALE IF A WIDOWS PROPERTY IS TO BE SPADED AWAY AND THE LAW SAYNOTHING TO IT. WHATS TO HINDER EM FROM CUTTING RIGHT AND LEFT IF THEYBEGIN ITS WELL KNOWN I CANT FIGHT.THE BEST WAY WOULD BE TO SAY NOTHING AND SET SOMEBODY ON TO SEND EMAWAY WITH A FLEA IN THEIR EAR WHEN THEY CAME SPYING AND MEASURINGSAID SOLOMON. FOLKS DID THAT ABOUT BRASSING BY WHAT I CAN UNDERSTAND.ITS ALL A PRETENCE IF THE TRUTH WAS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR BEING FORCEDTO TAKE ONE WAY. LET EM GO CUTTING IN ANOTHER PARISH. AND I DONTBELIEVE IN ANY PAY TO MAKE AMENDS FOR BRINGING A LOT OF RUFFIANS TOTRAMPLE YOUR CROPS. WHERES A COMPANYS POCKETBROTHER PETER GOD FORGIVE HIM GOT MONEY OUT OF A COMPANY SAID MRS.WAULE. BUT THAT WAS FOR THE MANGANESE. THAT WASNT FOR RAILWAYS TOBLOW YOU TO PIECES RIGHT AND LEFT.WELL THERES THIS TO BE SAID JANE MR. SOLOMON CONCLUDED LOWERINGHIS VOICE IN A CAUTIOUS MANNERTHE MORE SPOKES WE PUT IN THEIR WHEELTHE MORE THEYLL PAY US TO LET EM GO ON IF THEY MUST COME WHETHER ORNOT.THIS REASONING OF MR. SOLOMONS WAS PERHAPS LESS THOROUGH THAN HEIMAGINED HIS CUNNING BEARING ABOUT THE SAME RELATION TO THE COURSE OFRAILWAYS AS THE CUNNING OF A DIPLOMATIST BEARS TO THE GENERAL CHILL ORCATARRH OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. BUT HE SET ABOUT ACTING ON HIS VIEWS IN ATHOROUGHLY DIPLOMATIC MANNER BY STIMULATING SUSPICION. HIS SIDE OFLOWICK WAS THE MOST REMOTE FROM THE VILLAGE AND THE HOUSES OF THELABORING PEOPLE WERE EITHER LONE COTTAGES OR WERE COLLECTED IN A HAMLETCALLED FRICK WHERE A WATERMILL AND SOME STONEPITS MADE A LITTLECENTRE OF SLOW HEAVYSHOULDERED INDUSTRY.IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY PRECISE IDEA AS TO WHAT RAILWAYS WERE PUBLICOPINION IN FRICK WAS AGAINST THEM FOR THE HUMAN MIND IN THAT GRASSYCORNER HAD NOT THE PROVERBIAL TENDENCY TO ADMIRE THE UNKNOWN HOLDINGRATHER THAT IT WAS LIKELY TO BE AGAINST THE POOR MAN AND THATSUSPICION WAS THE ONLY WISE ATTITUDE WITH REGARD TO IT. EVEN THE RUMOROF REFORM HAD NOT YET EXCITED ANY MILLENNIAL EXPECTATIONS IN FRICKTHERE BEING NO DEFINITE PROMISE IN IT AS OF GRATUITOUS GRAINS TOFATTEN HIRAM FORDS PIG OR OF A PUBLICAN AT THE WEIGHTS AND SCALESWHO WOULD BREW BEER FOR NOTHING OR OF AN OFFER ON THE PART OF THETHREE NEIGHBORING FARMERS TO RAISE WAGES DURING WINTER. AND WITHOUTDISTINCT GOOD OF THIS KIND IN ITS PROMISES REFORM SEEMED ON A FOOTINGWITH THE BRAGGING OF PEDLERS WHICH WAS A HINT FOR DISTRUST TO EVERYKNOWING PERSON. THE MEN OF FRICK WERE NOT ILLFED AND WERE LESS GIVENTO FANATICISM THAN TO A STRONG MUSCULAR SUSPICION LESS INCLINED TOBELIEVE THAT THEY WERE PECULIARLY CARED FOR BY HEAVEN THAN TO REGARDHEAVEN ITSELF AS RATHER DISPOSED TO TAKE THEM INA DISPOSITIONOBSERVABLE IN THE WEATHER.THUS THE MIND OF FRICK WAS EXACTLY OF THE SORT FOR MR. SOLOMONFEATHERSTONE TO WORK UPON HE HAVING MORE PLENTEOUS IDEAS OF THE SAMEORDER WITH A SUSPICION OF HEAVEN AND EARTH WHICH WAS BETTER FED ANDMORE ENTIRELY AT LEISURE. SOLOMON WAS OVERSEER OF THE ROADS AT THATTIME AND ON HIS SLOWPACED COB OFTEN TOOK HIS ROUNDS BY FRICK TO LOOKAT THE WORKMEN GETTING THE STONES THERE PAUSING WITH A MYSTERIOUSDELIBERATION WHICH MIGHT HAVE MISLED YOU INTO SUPPOSING THAT HE HADSOME OTHER REASON FOR STAYING THAN THE MERE WANT OF IMPULSE TO MOVE.AFTER LOOKING FOR A LONG WHILE AT ANY WORK THAT WAS GOING ON HE WOULDRAISE HIS EYES A LITTLE AND LOOK AT THE HORIZON FINALLY HE WOULD SHAKEHIS BRIDLE TOUCH HIS HORSE WITH THE WHIP AND GET IT TO MOVE SLOWLYONWARD. THE HOURHAND OF A CLOCK WAS QUICK BY COMPARISON WITH MR.SOLOMON WHO HAD AN AGREEABLE SENSE THAT HE COULD AFFORD TO BE SLOW. HEWAS IN THE HABIT OF PAUSING FOR A CAUTIOUS VAGUELY DESIGNING CHAT WITHEVERY HEDGER OR DITCHER ON HIS WAY AND WAS ESPECIALLY WILLING TOLISTEN EVEN TO NEWS WHICH HE HAD HEARD BEFORE FEELING HIMSELF AT ANADVANTAGE OVER ALL NARRATORS IN PARTIALLY DISBELIEVING THEM. ONE DAYHOWEVER HE GOT INTO A DIALOGUE WITH HIRAM FORD A WAGONER IN WHICH HEHIMSELF CONTRIBUTED INFORMATION. HE WISHED TO KNOW WHETHER HIRAM HADSEEN FELLOWS WITH STAVES AND INSTRUMENTS SPYING ABOUT THEY CALLEDTHEMSELVES RAILROAD PEOPLE BUT THERE WAS NO TELLING WHAT THEY WERE ORWHAT THEY MEANT TO DO. THE LEAST THEY PRETENDED WAS THAT THEY WEREGOING TO CUT LOWICK PARISH INTO SIXES AND SEVENS.WHY THERELL BE NO STIRRIN FROM ONE PLAACE TO ANOTHER SAID HIRAMTHINKING OF HIS WAGON AND HORSES.NOT A BIT SAID MR. SOLOMON. AND CUTTING UP FINE LAND SUCH AS THISPARISH LET EM GO INTO TIPTON SAY I. BUT THERES NO KNOWING WHATTHERE IS AT THE BOTTOM OF IT. TRAFFIC IS WHAT THEY PUT FORARD BUTITS TO DO HARM TO THE LAND AND THE POOR MAN IN THE LONGRUN.WHY THEYRE LUNNON CHAPS I RECKON SAID HIRAM WHO HAD A DIM NOTIONOF LONDON AS A CENTRE OF HOSTILITY TO THE COUNTRY.AY TO BE SURE. AND IN SOME PARTS AGAINST BRASSING BY WHAT IVE HEARDSAY THE FOLKS FELL ON EM WHEN THEY WERE SPYING AND BROKE THEIRPEEPHOLES AS THEY CARRY AND DROVE EM AWAY SO AS THEY KNEW BETTERTHAN COME AGAIN.IT WAR GOOD FOON ID BE BOUND SAID HIRAM WHOSE FUN WAS MUCHRESTRICTED BY CIRCUMSTANCES.WELL I WOULDNT MEDDLE WITH EM MYSELF SAID SOLOMON. BUT SOME SAYTHIS COUNTRYS SEEN ITS BEST DAYS AND THE SIGN IS AS ITS BEINGOVERRUN WITH THESE FELLOWS TRAMPLING RIGHT AND LEFT AND WANTING TO CUTIT UP INTO RAILWAYS AND ALL FOR THE BIG TRAFFIC TO SWALLOW UP THELITTLE SO AS THERE SHANT BE A TEAM LEFT ON THE LAND NOR A WHIP TOCRACK.ILL CRACK MY WHIP ABOUT THEIR EARN AFORE THEY BRING IT TO THATTHOUGH SAID HIRAM WHILE MR. SOLOMON SHAKING HIS BRIDLE MOVEDONWARD.NETTLESEED NEEDS NO DIGGING. THE RUIN OF THIS COUNTRYSIDE BY RAILROADSWAS DISCUSSED NOT ONLY AT THE WEIGHTS AND SCALES BUT IN THEHAYFIELD WHERE THE MUSTER OF WORKING HANDS GAVE OPPORTUNITIES FORTALK SUCH AS WERE RARELY HAD THROUGH THE RURAL YEAR.ONE MORNING NOT LONG AFTER THAT INTERVIEW BETWEEN MR. FAREBROTHER ANDMARY GARTH IN WHICH SHE CONFESSED TO HIM HER FEELING FOR FRED VINCYIT HAPPENED THAT HER FATHER HAD SOME BUSINESS WHICH TOOK HIM TOYODDRELLS FARM IN THE DIRECTION OF FRICK IT WAS TO MEASURE AND VALUEAN OUTLYING PIECE OF LAND BELONGING TO LOWICK MANOR WHICH CALEBEXPECTED TO DISPOSE OF ADVANTAGEOUSLY FOR DOROTHEA IT MUST BECONFESSED THAT HIS BIAS WAS TOWARDS GETTING THE BEST POSSIBLE TERMSFROM RAILROAD COMPANIES. HE PUT UP HIS GIG AT YODDRELLS AND INWALKING WITH HIS ASSISTANT AND MEASURINGCHAIN TO THE SCENE OF HISWORK HE ENCOUNTERED THE PARTY OF THE COMPANYS AGENTS WHO WEREADJUSTING THEIR SPIRITLEVEL. AFTER A LITTLE CHAT HE LEFT THEMOBSERVING THAT BYANDBY THEY WOULD REACH HIM AGAIN WHERE HE WAS GOINGTO MEASURE. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE GRAY MORNINGS AFTER LIGHT RAINS WHICHBECOME DELICIOUS ABOUT TWELVE OCLOCK WHEN THE CLOUDS PART A LITTLEAND THE SCENT OF THE EARTH IS SWEET ALONG THE LANES AND BY THEHEDGEROWS.THE SCENT WOULD HAVE BEEN SWEETER TO FRED VINCY WHO WAS COMING ALONGTHE LANES ON HORSEBACK IF HIS MIND HAD NOT BEEN WORRIED BYUNSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO IMAGINE WHAT HE WAS TO DO WITH HIS FATHER ONONE SIDE EXPECTING HIM STRAIGHTWAY TO ENTER THE CHURCH WITH MARY ONTHE OTHER THREATENING TO FORSAKE HIM IF HE DID ENTER IT AND WITH THEWORKINGDAY WORLD SHOWING NO EAGER NEED WHATEVER OF A YOUNG GENTLEMANWITHOUT CAPITAL AND GENERALLY UNSKILLED. IT WAS THE HARDER TO FREDSDISPOSITION BECAUSE HIS FATHER SATISFIED THAT HE WAS NO LONGERREBELLIOUS WAS IN GOOD HUMOR WITH HIM AND HAD SENT HIM ON THISPLEASANT RIDE TO SEE AFTER SOME GREYHOUNDS. EVEN WHEN HE HAD FIXED ONWHAT HE SHOULD DO THERE WOULD BE THE TASK OF TELLING HIS FATHER. BUTIT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THE FIXING WHICH HAD TO COME FIRST WAS THEMORE DIFFICULT TASKWHAT SECULAR AVOCATION ON EARTH WAS THERE FOR AYOUNG MAN WHOSE FRIENDS COULD NOT GET HIM AN APPOINTMENT WHICH WASAT ONCE GENTLEMANLY LUCRATIVE AND TO BE FOLLOWED WITHOUT SPECIALKNOWLEDGE RIDING ALONG THE LANES BY FRICK IN THIS MOOD AND SLACKENINGHIS PACE WHILE HE REFLECTED WHETHER HE SHOULD VENTURE TO GO ROUND BYLOWICK PARSONAGE TO CALL ON MARY HE COULD SEE OVER THE HEDGES FROM ONEFIELD TO ANOTHER. SUDDENLY A NOISE ROUSED HIS ATTENTION AND ON THE FARSIDE OF A FIELD ON HIS LEFT HAND HE COULD SEE SIX OR SEVEN MEN INSMOCKFROCKS WITH HAYFORKS IN THEIR HANDS MAKING AN OFFENSIVE APPROACHTOWARDS THE FOUR RAILWAY AGENTS WHO WERE FACING THEM WHILE CALEB GARTHAND HIS ASSISTANT WERE HASTENING ACROSS THE FIELD TO JOIN THETHREATENED GROUP. FRED DELAYED A FEW MOMENTS BY HAVING TO FIND THEGATE COULD NOT GALLOP UP TO THE SPOT BEFORE THE PARTY IN SMOCKFROCKSWHOSE WORK OF TURNING THE HAY HAD NOT BEEN TOO PRESSING AFTERSWALLOWING THEIR MIDDAY BEER WERE DRIVING THE MEN IN COATS BEFORETHEM WITH THEIR HAYFORKS WHILE CALEB GARTHS ASSISTANT A LAD OFSEVENTEEN WHO HAD SNATCHED UP THE SPIRITLEVEL AT CALEBS ORDER HADBEEN KNOCKED DOWN AND SEEMED TO BE LYING HELPLESS. THE COATED MEN HADTHE ADVANTAGE AS RUNNERS AND FRED COVERED THEIR RETREAT BY GETTING INFRONT OF THE SMOCKFROCKS AND CHARGING THEM SUDDENLY ENOUGH TO THROWTHEIR CHASE INTO CONFUSION. WHAT DO YOU CONFOUNDED FOOLS MEANSHOUTED FRED PURSUING THE DIVIDED GROUP IN A ZIGZAG AND CUTTING RIGHTAND LEFT WITH HIS WHIP. ILL SWEAR TO EVERY ONE OF YOU BEFORE THEMAGISTRATE. YOUVE KNOCKED THE LAD DOWN AND KILLED HIM FOR WHAT IKNOW. YOULL EVERY ONE OF YOU BE HANGED AT THE NEXT ASSIZES IF YOUDONT MIND SAID FRED WHO AFTERWARDS LAUGHED HEARTILY AS HEREMEMBERED HIS OWN PHRASES.THE LABORERS HAD BEEN DRIVEN THROUGH THE GATEWAY INTO THEIR HAYFIELDAND FRED HAD CHECKED HIS HORSE WHEN HIRAM FORD OBSERVING HIMSELF AT ASAFE CHALLENGING DISTANCE TURNED BACK AND SHOUTED A DEFIANCE WHICH HEDID NOT KNOW TO BE HOMERIC.YORE A COWARD YO ARE. YO GIT OFF YOUR HORSE YOUNG MEASTER AND ILLHAVE A ROUND WI YE I WULL. YO DAREDNT COME ON WIOUT YOUR HOSS ANWHIP. ID SOON KNOCK THE BREATH OUT ON YE I WOULD.WAIT A MINUTE AND ILL COME BACK PRESENTLY AND HAVE A ROUND WITH YOUALL IN TURN IF YOU LIKE SAID FRED WHO FELT CONFIDENCE IN HIS POWEROF BOXING WITH HIS DEARLY BELOVED BRETHREN. BUT JUST NOW HE WANTED TOHASTEN BACK TO CALEB AND THE PROSTRATE YOUTH.THE LADS ANKLE WAS STRAINED AND HE WAS IN MUCH PAIN FROM IT BUT HEWAS NO FURTHER HURT AND FRED PLACED HIM ON THE HORSE THAT HE MIGHTRIDE TO YODDRELLS AND BE TAKEN CARE OF THERE.LET THEM PUT THE HORSE IN THE STABLE AND TELL THE SURVEYORS THEY CANCOME BACK FOR THEIR TRAPS SAID FRED. THE GROUND IS CLEAR NOW.NO NO SAID CALEB HERES A BREAKAGE. THEYLL HAVE TO GIVE UP FORTODAY AND IT WILL BE AS WELL. HERE TAKE THE THINGS BEFORE YOU ON THEHORSE TOM. THEYLL SEE YOU COMING AND THEYLL TURN BACK.IM GLAD I HAPPENED TO BE HERE AT THE RIGHT MOMENT MR. GARTH SAIDFRED AS TOM RODE AWAY. NO KNOWING WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IF THECAVALRY HAD NOT COME UP IN TIME.AY AY IT WAS LUCKY SAID CALEB SPEAKING RATHER ABSENTLY ANDLOOKING TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD BEEN AT WORK AT THE MOMENT OFINTERRUPTION. BUTDEUCE TAKE ITTHIS IS WHAT COMES OF MEN BEINGFOOLSIM HINDERED OF MY DAYS WORK. I CANT GET ALONG WITHOUT SOMEBODYTO HELP ME WITH THE MEASURINGCHAIN. HOWEVER HE WAS BEGINNING TO MOVETOWARDS THE SPOT WITH A LOOK OF VEXATION AS IF HE HAD FORGOTTEN FREDSPRESENCE BUT SUDDENLY HE TURNED ROUND AND SAID QUICKLY WHAT HAVE YOUGOT TO DO TODAY YOUNG FELLOWNOTHING MR. GARTH. ILL HELP YOU WITH PLEASURECAN I SAID FREDWITH A SENSE THAT HE SHOULD BE COURTING MARY WHEN HE WAS HELPING HERFATHER.WELL YOU MUSTNT MIND STOOPING AND GETTING HOT.I DONT MIND ANYTHING. ONLY I WANT TO GO FIRST AND HAVE A ROUND WITHTHAT HULKY FELLOW WHO TURNED TO CHALLENGE ME. IT WOULD BE A GOOD LESSONFOR HIM. I SHALL NOT BE FIVE MINUTES.NONSENSE SAID CALEB WITH HIS MOST PEREMPTORY INTONATION. I SHALLGO AND SPEAK TO THE MEN MYSELF. ITS ALL IGNORANCE. SOMEBODY HAS BEENTELLING THEM LIES. THE POOR FOOLS DONT KNOW ANY BETTER.I SHALL GO WITH YOU THEN SAID FRED.NO NO STAY WHERE YOU ARE. I DONT WANT YOUR YOUNG BLOOD. I CAN TAKECARE OF MYSELF.CALEB WAS A POWERFUL MAN AND KNEW LITTLE OF ANY FEAR EXCEPT THE FEAR OFHURTING OTHERS AND THE FEAR OF HAVING TO SPEECHIFY. BUT HE FELT IT HISDUTY AT THIS MOMENT TO TRY AND GIVE A LITTLE HARANGUE. THERE WAS ASTRIKING MIXTURE IN HIMWHICH CAME FROM HIS HAVING ALWAYS BEEN AHARDWORKING MAN HIMSELFOF RIGOROUS NOTIONS ABOUT WORKMEN ANDPRACTICAL INDULGENCE TOWARDS THEM. TO DO A GOOD DAYS WORK AND TO DO ITWELL HE HELD TO BE PART OF THEIR WELFARE AS IT WAS THE CHIEF PART OFHIS OWN HAPPINESS BUT HE HAD A STRONG SENSE OF FELLOWSHIP WITH THEM.WHEN HE ADVANCED TOWARDS THE LABORERS THEY HAD NOT GONE TO WORK AGAINBUT WERE STANDING IN THAT FORM OF RURAL GROUPING WHICH CONSISTS IN EACHTURNING A SHOULDER TOWARDS THE OTHER AT A DISTANCE OF TWO OR THREEYARDS. THEY LOOKED RATHER SULKILY AT CALEB WHO WALKED QUICKLY WITH ONEHAND IN HIS POCKET AND THE OTHER THRUST BETWEEN THE BUTTONS OF HISWAISTCOAT AND HAD HIS EVERYDAY MILD AIR WHEN HE PAUSED AMONG THEM.WHY MY LADS HOWS THIS HE BEGAN TAKING AS USUAL TO BRIEF PHRASESWHICH SEEMED PREGNANT TO HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAD MANY THOUGHTS LYINGUNDER THEM LIKE THE ABUNDANT ROOTS OF A PLANT THAT JUST MANAGES TOPEEP ABOVE THE WATER. HOW CAME YOU TO MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE AS THISSOMEBODY HAS BEEN TELLING YOU LIES. YOU THOUGHT THOSE MEN UP THEREWANTED TO DO MISCHIEF.AW WAS THE ANSWER DROPPED AT INTERVALS BY EACH ACCORDING TO HISDEGREE OF UNREADINESS.NONSENSE NO SUCH THING THEYRE LOOKING OUT TO SEE WHICH WAY THERAILROAD IS TO TAKE. NOW MY LADS YOU CANT HINDER THE RAILROAD ITWILL BE MADE WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. AND IF YOU GO FIGHTING AGAINSTIT YOULL GET YOURSELVES INTO TROUBLE. THE LAW GIVES THOSE MEN LEAVETO COME HERE ON THE LAND. THE OWNER HAS NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST IT ANDIF YOU MEDDLE WITH THEM YOULL HAVE TO DO WITH THE CONSTABLE ANDJUSTICE BLAKESLEY AND WITH THE HANDCUFFS AND MIDDLEMARCH JAIL. AND YOUMIGHT BE IN FOR IT NOW IF ANYBODY INFORMED AGAINST YOU.CALEB PAUSED HERE AND PERHAPS THE GREATEST ORATOR COULD NOT HAVECHOSEN EITHER HIS PAUSE OR HIS IMAGES BETTER FOR THE OCCASION.BUT COME YOU DIDNT MEAN ANY HARM. SOMEBODY TOLD YOU THE RAILROAD WASA BAD THING. THAT WAS A LIE. IT MAY DO A BIT OF HARM HERE AND THERE TOTHIS AND TO THAT AND SO DOES THE SUN IN HEAVEN. BUT THE RAILWAYS AGOOD THING.AW GOOD FOR THE BIG FOLKS TO MAKE MONEY OUT ON SAID OLD TIMOTHYCOOPER WHO HAD STAYED BEHIND TURNING HIS HAY WHILE THE OTHERS HAD BEENGONE ON THEIR SPREEIN SEEN LOTS O THINGS TURN UP SIN I WAR AYOUNG UNTHE WAR AN THE PEACE AND THE CANELLS AN THE OALD KINGGEORGE AN THE REGEN AN THE NEW KING GEORGE AN THE NEW UN AS HASGOT A NEW NEAMEAN ITS BEEN ALL ALOIKE TO THE POOR MON. WHATS THECANELLS BEEN T HIM THEYN BROUGHT HIM NEYTHER MEAT NOR BEACON NORWAGE TO LAY BY IF HE DIDNT SAVE IT WI CLEMMIN HIS OWN INSIDE. TIMESHA GOT WUSSER FOR HIM SIN I WAR A YOUNG UN. AN SO ITLL BE WI THERAILROADS. THEYLL ONY LEAVE THE POOR MON FURDER BEHIND. BUT THEM AREFOOLS AS MEDDLE AND SO I TOLD THE CHAPS HERE. THIS IS THE BIG FOLKSSWORLD THIS IS. BUT YORE FOR THE BIG FOLKS MUSTER GARTH YO ARE.TIMOTHY WAS A WIRY OLD LABORER OF A TYPE LINGERING IN THOSE TIMESWHOHAD HIS SAVINGS IN A STOCKINGFOOT LIVED IN A LONE COTTAGE AND WASNOT TO BE WROUGHT ON BY ANY ORATORY HAVING AS LITTLE OF THE FEUDALSPIRIT AND BELIEVING AS LITTLE AS IF HE HAD NOT BEEN TOTALLYUNACQUAINTED WITH THE AGE OF REASON AND THE RIGHTS OF MAN. CALEB WAS INA DIFFICULTY KNOWN TO ANY PERSON ATTEMPTING IN DARK TIMES ANDUNASSISTED BY MIRACLE TO REASON WITH RUSTICS WHO ARE IN POSSESSION OFAN UNDENIABLE TRUTH WHICH THEY KNOW THROUGH A HARD PROCESS OF FEELINGAND CAN LET IT FALL LIKE A GIANTS CLUB ON YOUR NEATLY CARVED ARGUMENTFOR A SOCIAL BENEFIT WHICH THEY DO NOT FEEL. CALEB HAD NO CANT ATCOMMAND EVEN IF HE COULD HAVE CHOSEN TO USE IT AND HE HAD BEENACCUSTOMED TO MEET ALL SUCH DIFFICULTIES IN NO OTHER WAY THAN BY DOINGHIS BUSINESS FAITHFULLY. HE ANSWEREDIF YOU DONT THINK WELL OF ME TIM NEVER MIND THATS NEITHER HERENOR THERE NOW. THINGS MAY BE BAD FOR THE POOR MANBAD THEY ARE BUT IWANT THE LADS HERE NOT TO DO WHAT WILL MAKE THINGS WORSE FORTHEMSELVES. THE CATTLE MAY HAVE A HEAVY LOAD BUT IT WONT HELP EM TOTHROW IT OVER INTO THE ROADSIDE PIT WHEN ITS PARTLY THEIR OWNFODDER.WE WAR ONY FOR A BIT O FOON SAID HIRAM WHO WAS BEGINNING TO SEECONSEQUENCES. THAT WAR ALL WE WAR ARTER.WELL PROMISE ME NOT TO MEDDLE AGAIN AND ILL SEE THAT NOBODY INFORMSAGAINST YOU.IN NEER MEDDLED AN IN NO CALL TO PROMISE SAID TIMOTHY.NO BUT THE REST. COME IM AS HARD AT WORK AS ANY OF YOU TODAY ANDI CANT SPARE MUCH TIME. SAY YOULL BE QUIET WITHOUT THE CONSTABLE.AW WE WOOANT MEDDLETHEY MAY DO AS THEY LOIKE FOR OOSWERE THE FORMSIN WHICH CALEB GOT HIS PLEDGES AND THEN HE HASTENED BACK TO FRED WHOHAD FOLLOWED HIM AND WATCHED HIM IN THE GATEWAY.THEY WENT TO WORK AND FRED HELPED VIGOROUSLY. HIS SPIRITS HAD RISENAND HE HEARTILY ENJOYED A GOOD SLIP IN THE MOIST EARTH UNDER THEHEDGEROW WHICH SOILED HIS PERFECT SUMMER TROUSERS. WAS IT HISSUCCESSFUL ONSET WHICH HAD ELATED HIM OR THE SATISFACTION OF HELPINGMARYS FATHER SOMETHING MORE. THE ACCIDENTS OF THE MORNING HAD HELPEDHIS FRUSTRATED IMAGINATION TO SHAPE AN EMPLOYMENT FOR HIMSELF WHICH HADSEVERAL ATTRACTIONS. I AM NOT SURE THAT CERTAIN FIBRES IN MR. GARTHSMIND HAD NOT RESUMED THEIR OLD VIBRATION TOWARDS THE VERY END WHICH NOWREVEALED ITSELF TO FRED. FOR THE EFFECTIVE ACCIDENT IS BUT THE TOUCH OFFIRE WHERE THERE IS OIL AND TOW AND IT ALWAYS APPEARED TO FRED THATTHE RAILWAY BROUGHT THE NEEDED TOUCH. BUT THEY WENT ON IN SILENCEEXCEPT WHEN THEIR BUSINESS DEMANDED SPEECH. AT LAST WHEN THEY HADFINISHED AND WERE WALKING AWAY MR. GARTH SAIDA YOUNG FELLOW NEEDNT BE A B. A. TO DO THIS SORT OF WORK EH FREDI WISH I HAD TAKEN TO IT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF BEING A B. A. SAIDFRED. HE PAUSED A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED MORE HESITATINGLY DO YOUTHINK I AM TOO OLD TO LEARN YOUR BUSINESS MR. GARTHMY BUSINESS IS OF MANY SORTS MY BOY SAID MR. GARTH SMILING. AGOOD DEAL OF WHAT I KNOW CAN ONLY COME FROM EXPERIENCE YOU CANT LEARNIT OFF AS YOU LEARN THINGS OUT OF A BOOK. BUT YOU ARE YOUNG ENOUGH TOLAY A FOUNDATION YET. CALEB PRONOUNCED THE LAST SENTENCE EMPHATICALLYBUT PAUSED IN SOME UNCERTAINTY. HE HAD BEEN UNDER THE IMPRESSION LATELYTHAT FRED HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO ENTER THE CHURCH.YOU DO THINK I COULD DO SOME GOOD AT IT IF I WERE TO TRY SAID FREDMORE EAGERLY.THAT DEPENDS SAID CALEB TURNING HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND LOWERINGHIS VOICE WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO FELT HIMSELF TO BE SAYINGSOMETHING DEEPLY RELIGIOUS. YOU MUST BE SURE OF TWO THINGS YOU MUSTLOVE YOUR WORK AND NOT BE ALWAYS LOOKING OVER THE EDGE OF IT WANTINGYOUR PLAY TO BEGIN. AND THE OTHER IS YOU MUST NOT BE ASHAMED OF YOURWORK AND THINK IT WOULD BE MORE HONORABLE TO YOU TO BE DOING SOMETHINGELSE. YOU MUST HAVE A PRIDE IN YOUR OWN WORK AND IN LEARNING TO DO ITWELL AND NOT BE ALWAYS SAYING THERES THIS AND THERES THATIF I HADTHIS OR THAT TO DO I MIGHT MAKE SOMETHING OF IT. NO MATTER WHAT A MANISI WOULDNT GIVE TWOPENCE FOR HIMHERE CALEBS MOUTH LOOKED BITTERAND HE SNAPPED HIS FINGERSWHETHER HE WAS THE PRIME MINISTER OR THERICKTHATCHER IF HE DIDNT DO WELL WHAT HE UNDERTOOK TO DO.I CAN NEVER FEEL THAT I SHOULD DO THAT IN BEING A CLERGYMAN SAIDFRED MEANING TO TAKE A STEP IN ARGUMENT.THEN LET IT ALONE MY BOY SAID CALEB ABRUPTLY ELSE YOULL NEVERBE EASY. OR IF YOU ARE EASY YOULL BE A POOR STICK.THAT IS VERY NEARLY WHAT MARY THINKS ABOUT IT SAID FRED COLORING.I THINK YOU MUST KNOW WHAT I FEEL FOR MARY MR. GARTH I HOPE IT DOESNOT DISPLEASE YOU THAT I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED HER BETTER THAN ANY ONEELSE AND THAT I SHALL NEVER LOVE ANY ONE AS I LOVE HER.THE EXPRESSION OF CALEBS FACE WAS VISIBLY SOFTENING WHILE FRED SPOKE.BUT HE SWUNG HIS HEAD WITH A SOLEMN SLOWNESS AND SAIDTHAT MAKES THINGS MORE SERIOUS FRED IF YOU WANT TO TAKE MARYSHAPPINESS INTO YOUR KEEPING.I KNOW THAT MR. GARTH SAID FRED EAGERLY AND I WOULD DO ANYTHINGFOR HER. SHE SAYS SHE WILL NEVER HAVE ME IF I GO INTO THE CHURCH ANDI SHALL BE THE MOST MISERABLE DEVIL IN THE WORLD IF I LOSE ALL HOPE OFMARY. REALLY IF I COULD GET SOME OTHER PROFESSION BUSINESSANYTHINGTHAT I AM AT ALL FIT FOR I WOULD WORK HARD I WOULD DESERVE YOUR GOODOPINION. I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE TO DO WITH OUTDOOR THINGS. I KNOW A GOODDEAL ABOUT LAND AND CATTLE ALREADY. I USED TO BELIEVE YOU KNOWTHOUGHYOU WILL THINK ME RATHER FOOLISH FOR ITTHAT I SHOULD HAVE LAND OF MYOWN. I AM SURE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT SORT WOULD COME EASILY TO MEESPECIALLY IF I COULD BE UNDER YOU IN ANY WAY.SOFTLY MY BOY SAID CALEB HAVING THE IMAGE OF SUSAN BEFORE HISEYES. WHAT HAVE YOU SAID TO YOUR FATHER ABOUT ALL THISNOTHING YET BUT I MUST TELL HIM. I AM ONLY WAITING TO KNOW WHAT ICAN DO INSTEAD OF ENTERING THE CHURCH. I AM VERY SORRY TO DISAPPOINTHIM BUT A MAN OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED TO JUDGE FOR HIMSELF WHEN HE ISFOURANDTWENTY. HOW COULD I KNOW WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN WHAT IT WOULD BERIGHT FOR ME TO DO NOW MY EDUCATION WAS A MISTAKE.BUT HEARKEN TO THIS FRED SAID CALEB. ARE YOU SURE MARY IS FOND OFYOU OR WOULD EVER HAVE YOUI ASKED MR. FAREBROTHER TO TALK TO HER BECAUSE SHE HAD FORBIDDEN MEIDIDNT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO SAID FRED APOLOGETICALLY. AND HE SAYSTHAT I HAVE EVERY REASON TO HOPE IF I CAN PUT MYSELF IN AN HONORABLEPOSITIONI MEAN OUT OF THE CHURCH. I DARE SAY YOU THINK ITUNWARRANTABLE IN ME MR. GARTH TO BE TROUBLING YOU AND OBTRUDING MYOWN WISHES ABOUT MARY BEFORE I HAVE DONE ANYTHING AT ALL FOR MYSELF.OF COURSE I HAVE NOT THE LEAST CLAIMINDEED I HAVE ALREADY A DEBT TOYOU WHICH WILL NEVER BE DISCHARGED EVEN WHEN I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PAYIT IN THE SHAPE OF MONEY.YES MY BOY YOU HAVE A CLAIM SAID CALEB WITH MUCH FEELING IN HISVOICE. THE YOUNG ONES HAVE ALWAYS A CLAIM ON THE OLD TO HELP THEMFORWARD. I WAS YOUNG MYSELF ONCE AND HAD TO DO WITHOUT MUCH HELP BUTHELP WOULD HAVE BEEN WELCOME TO ME IF IT HAD BEEN ONLY FOR THEFELLOWFEELINGS SAKE. BUT I MUST CONSIDER. COME TO ME TOMORROW AT THEOFFICE AT NINE OCLOCK. AT THE OFFICE MIND.MR. GARTH WOULD TAKE NO IMPORTANT STEP WITHOUT CONSULTING SUSAN BUT ITMUST BE CONFESSED THAT BEFORE HE REACHED HOME HE HAD TAKEN HISRESOLUTION. WITH REGARD TO A LARGE NUMBER OF MATTERS ABOUT WHICH OTHERMEN ARE DECIDED OR OBSTINATE HE WAS THE MOST EASILY MANAGEABLE MAN INTHE WORLD. HE NEVER KNEW WHAT MEAT HE WOULD CHOOSE AND IF SUSAN HADSAID THAT THEY OUGHT TO LIVE IN A FOURROOMED COTTAGE IN ORDER TOSAVE HE WOULD HAVE SAID LET US GO WITHOUT INQUIRING INTO DETAILS.BUT WHERE CALEBS FEELING AND JUDGMENT STRONGLY PRONOUNCED HE WAS ARULER AND IN SPITE OF HIS MILDNESS AND TIMIDITY IN REPROVING EVERYONE ABOUT HIM KNEW THAT ON THE EXCEPTIONAL OCCASIONS WHEN HE CHOSE HEWAS ABSOLUTE. HE NEVER INDEED CHOSE TO BE ABSOLUTE EXCEPT ON SOME ONEELSES BEHALF. ON NINETYNINE POINTS MRS. GARTH DECIDED BUT ON THEHUNDREDTH SHE WAS OFTEN AWARE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO PERFORM THESINGULARLY DIFFICULT TASK OF CARRYING OUT HER OWN PRINCIPLE AND TOMAKE HERSELF SUBORDINATE.IT IS COME ROUND AS I THOUGHT SUSAN SAID CALEB WHEN THEY WERESEATED ALONE IN THE EVENING. HE HAD ALREADY NARRATED THE ADVENTUREWHICH HAD BROUGHT ABOUT FREDS SHARING IN HIS WORK BUT HAD KEPT BACKTHE FURTHER RESULT. THE CHILDREN ARE FOND OF EACH OTHERI MEAN FREDAND MARY.MRS. GARTH LAID HER WORK ON HER KNEE AND FIXED HER PENETRATING EYESANXIOUSLY ON HER HUSBAND.AFTER WED DONE OUR WORK FRED POURED IT ALL OUT TO ME. HE CANT BEARTO BE A CLERGYMAN AND MARY SAYS SHE WONT HAVE HIM IF HE IS ONE ANDTHE LAD WOULD LIKE TO BE UNDER ME AND GIVE HIS MIND TO BUSINESS. ANDIVE DETERMINED TO TAKE HIM AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM.CALEB SAID MRS. GARTH IN A DEEP CONTRALTO EXPRESSIVE OF RESIGNEDASTONISHMENT.ITS A FINE THING TO DO SAID MR. GARTH SETTLING HIMSELF FIRMLYAGAINST THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR AND GRASPING THE ELBOWS. I SHALL HAVETROUBLE WITH HIM BUT I THINK I SHALL CARRY IT THROUGH. THE LAD LOVESMARY AND A TRUE LOVE FOR A GOOD WOMAN IS A GREAT THING SUSAN. ITSHAPES MANY A ROUGH FELLOW.HAS MARY SPOKEN TO YOU ON THE SUBJECT SAID MRS GARTH SECRETLY ALITTLE HURT THAT SHE HAD TO BE INFORMED ON IT HERSELF.NOT A WORD. I ASKED HER ABOUT FRED ONCE I GAVE HER A BIT OF AWARNING. BUT SHE ASSURED ME SHE WOULD NEVER MARRY AN IDLESELFINDULGENT MANNOTHING SINCE. BUT IT SEEMS FRED SET ON MR.FAREBROTHER TO TALK TO HER BECAUSE SHE HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO SPEAKHIMSELF AND MR. FAREBROTHER HAS FOUND OUT THAT SHE IS FOND OF FREDBUT SAYS HE MUST NOT BE A CLERGYMAN. FREDS HEART IS FIXED ON MARYTHAT I CAN SEE IT GIVES ME A GOOD OPINION OF THE LADAND WE ALWAYSLIKED HIM SUSAN.IT IS A PITY FOR MARY I THINK SAID MRS. GARTH.WHYA PITYBECAUSE CALEB SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD A MAN WHO IS WORTH TWENTY FREDVINCYS.AH SAID CALEB WITH SURPRISE.I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT MR. FAREBROTHER IS ATTACHED TO HER AND MEANT TOMAKE HER AN OFFER BUT OF COURSE NOW THAT FRED HAS USED HIM AS ANENVOY THERE IS AN END TO THAT BETTER PROSPECT. THERE WAS A SEVEREPRECISION IN MRS. GARTHS UTTERANCE. SHE WAS VEXED AND DISAPPOINTEDBUT SHE WAS BENT ON ABSTAINING FROM USELESS WORDS.CALEB WAS SILENT A FEW MOMENTS UNDER A CONFLICT OF FEELINGS. HE LOOKEDAT THE FLOOR AND MOVED HIS HEAD AND HANDS IN ACCOMPANIMENT TO SOMEINWARD ARGUMENTATION. AT LAST HE SAIDTHAT WOULD HAVE MADE ME VERY PROUD AND HAPPY SUSAN AND I SHOULD HAVEBEEN GLAD FOR YOUR SAKE. IVE ALWAYS FELT THAT YOUR BELONGINGS HAVENEVER BEEN ON A LEVEL WITH YOU. BUT YOU TOOK ME THOUGH I WAS A PLAINMAN.I TOOK THE BEST AND CLEVEREST MAN I HAD EVER KNOWN SAID MRS. GARTHCONVINCED THAT SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE LOVED ANY ONE WHO CAME SHORT OFTHAT MARK.WELL PERHAPS OTHERS THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER. BUT IT WOULDHAVE BEEN WORSE FOR ME. AND THAT IS WHAT TOUCHES ME CLOSE ABOUT FRED.THE LAD IS GOOD AT BOTTOM AND CLEVER ENOUGH TO DO IF HES PUT IN THERIGHT WAY AND HE LOVES AND HONORS MY DAUGHTER BEYOND ANYTHING AND SHEHAS GIVEN HIM A SORT OF PROMISE ACCORDING TO WHAT HE TURNS OUT. I SAYTHAT YOUNG MANS SOUL IS IN MY HAND AND ILL DO THE BEST I CAN FORHIM SO HELP ME GOD ITS MY DUTY SUSAN.MRS. GARTH WAS NOT GIVEN TO TEARS BUT THERE WAS A LARGE ONE ROLLINGDOWN HER FACE BEFORE HER HUSBAND HAD FINISHED. IT CAME FROM THEPRESSURE OF VARIOUS FEELINGS IN WHICH THERE WAS MUCH AFFECTION ANDSOME VEXATION. SHE WIPED IT AWAY QUICKLY SAYINGFEW MEN BESIDES YOU WOULD THINK IT A DUTY TO ADD TO THEIR ANXIETIES INTHAT WAY CALEB.THAT SIGNIFIES NOTHINGWHAT OTHER MEN WOULD THINK. IVE GOT A CLEARFEELING INSIDE ME AND THAT I SHALL FOLLOW AND I HOPE YOUR HEART WILLGO WITH ME SUSAN IN MAKING EVERYTHING AS LIGHT AS CAN BE TO MARYPOOR CHILD.CALEB LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR LOOKED WITH ANXIOUS APPEAL TOWARDSHIS WIFE. SHE ROSE AND KISSED HIM SAYING GOD BLESS YOU CALEB OURCHILDREN HAVE A GOOD FATHER.BUT SHE WENT OUT AND HAD A HEARTY CRY TO MAKE UP FOR THE SUPPRESSION OFHER WORDS. SHE FELT SURE THAT HER HUSBANDS CONDUCT WOULD BEMISUNDERSTOOD AND ABOUT FRED SHE WAS RATIONAL AND UNHOPEFUL. WHICHWOULD TURN OUT TO HAVE THE MORE FORESIGHT IN ITHER RATIONALITY ORCALEBS ARDENT GENEROSITYWHEN FRED WENT TO THE OFFICE THE NEXT MORNING THERE WAS A TEST TO BEGONE THROUGH WHICH HE WAS NOT PREPARED FOR.NOW FRED SAID CALEB YOU WILL HAVE SOME DESKWORK. I HAVE ALWAYSDONE A GOOD DEAL OF WRITING MYSELF BUT I CANT DO WITHOUT HELP AND ASI WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE ACCOUNTS AND GET THE VALUES INTO YOURHEAD I MEAN TO DO WITHOUT ANOTHER CLERK. SO YOU MUST BUCKLE TO. HOWARE YOU AT WRITING AND ARITHMETICFRED FELT AN AWKWARD MOVEMENT OF THE HEART HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OFDESKWORK BUT HE WAS IN A RESOLUTE MOOD AND NOT GOING TO SHRINK. IMNOT AFRAID OF ARITHMETIC MR. GARTH IT ALWAYS CAME EASILY TO ME. ITHINK YOU KNOW MY WRITING.LET US SEE SAID CALEB TAKING UP A PEN EXAMINING IT CAREFULLY ANDHANDING IT WELL DIPPED TO FRED WITH A SHEET OF RULED PAPER. COPY MEA LINE OR TWO OF THAT VALUATION WITH THE FIGURES AT THE END.AT THAT TIME THE OPINION EXISTED THAT IT WAS BENEATH A GENTLEMAN TOWRITE LEGIBLY OR WITH A HAND IN THE LEAST SUITABLE TO A CLERK. FREDWROTE THE LINES DEMANDED IN A HAND AS GENTLEMANLY AS THAT OF ANYVISCOUNT OR BISHOP OF THE DAY THE VOWELS WERE ALL ALIKE AND THECONSONANTS ONLY DISTINGUISHABLE AS TURNING UP OR DOWN THE STROKES HADA BLOTTED SOLIDITY AND THE LETTERS DISDAINED TO KEEP THE LINEIN SHORTIT WAS A MANUSCRIPT OF THAT VENERABLE KIND EASY TO INTERPRET WHEN YOUKNOW BEFOREHAND WHAT THE WRITER MEANS.AS CALEB LOOKED ON HIS VISAGE SHOWED A GROWING DEPRESSION BUT WHENFRED HANDED HIM THE PAPER HE GAVE SOMETHING LIKE A SNARL AND RAPPEDTHE PAPER PASSIONATELY WITH THE BACK OF HIS HAND. BAD WORK LIKE THISDISPELLED ALL CALEBS MILDNESS.THE DEUCE HE EXCLAIMED SNARLINGLY. TO THINK THAT THIS IS A COUNTRYWHERE A MANS EDUCATION MAY COST HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND IT TURNSYOU OUT THIS THEN IN A MORE PATHETIC TONE PUSHING UP HIS SPECTACLESAND LOOKING AT THE UNFORTUNATE SCRIBE THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON USFRED I CANT PUT UP WITH THISWHAT CAN I DO MR. GARTH SAID FRED WHOSE SPIRITS HAD SUNK VERY LOWNOT ONLY AT THE ESTIMATE OF HIS HANDWRITING BUT AT THE VISION OFHIMSELF AS LIABLE TO BE RANKED WITH OFFICE CLERKS.DO WHY YOU MUST LEARN TO FORM YOUR LETTERS AND KEEP THE LINE. WHATSTHE USE OF WRITING AT ALL IF NOBODY CAN UNDERSTAND IT ASKED CALEBENERGETICALLY QUITE PREOCCUPIED WITH THE BAD QUALITY OF THE WORK. ISTHERE SO LITTLE BUSINESS IN THE WORLD THAT YOU MUST BE SENDING PUZZLESOVER THE COUNTRY BUT THATS THE WAY PEOPLE ARE BROUGHT UP. I SHOULDLOSE NO END OF TIME WITH THE LETTERS SOME PEOPLE SEND ME IF SUSAN DIDNOT MAKE THEM OUT FOR ME. ITS DISGUSTING. HERE CALEB TOSSED THE PAPERFROM HIM.ANY STRANGER PEEPING INTO THE OFFICE AT THAT MOMENT MIGHT HAVE WONDEREDWHAT WAS THE DRAMA BETWEEN THE INDIGNANT MAN OF BUSINESS AND THEFINELOOKING YOUNG FELLOW WHOSE BLOND COMPLEXION WAS GETTING RATHERPATCHY AS HE BIT HIS LIP WITH MORTIFICATION. FRED WAS STRUGGLING WITHMANY THOUGHTS. MR. GARTH HAD BEEN SO KIND AND ENCOURAGING AT THEBEGINNING OF THEIR INTERVIEW THAT GRATITUDE AND HOPEFULNESS HAD BEENAT A HIGH PITCH AND THE DOWNFALL WAS PROPORTIONATE. HE HAD NOT THOUGHTOF DESKWORKIN FACT LIKE THE MAJORITY OF YOUNG GENTLEMEN HE WANTEDAN OCCUPATION WHICH SHOULD BE FREE FROM DISAGREEABLES. I CANNOT TELLWHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CONSEQUENCES IF HE HAD NOT DISTINCTLY PROMISEDHIMSELF THAT HE WOULD GO TO LOWICK TO SEE MARY AND TELL HER THAT HE WASENGAGED TO WORK UNDER HER FATHER. HE DID NOT LIKE TO DISAPPOINT HIMSELFTHERE.I AM VERY SORRY WERE ALL THE WORDS THAT HE COULD MUSTER. BUT MR.GARTH WAS ALREADY RELENTING.WE MUST MAKE THE BEST OF IT FRED HE BEGAN WITH A RETURN TO HISUSUAL QUIET TONE. EVERY MAN CAN LEARN TO WRITE. I TAUGHT MYSELF. GO ATIT WITH A WILL AND SIT UP AT NIGHT IF THE DAYTIME ISNT ENOUGH. WELLBE PATIENT MY BOY. CALLUM SHALL GO ON WITH THE BOOKS FOR A BIT WHILEYOU ARE LEARNING. BUT NOW I MUST BE OFF SAID CALEB RISING. YOU MUSTLET YOUR FATHER KNOW OUR AGREEMENT. YOULL SAVE ME CALLUMS SALARY YOUKNOW WHEN YOU CAN WRITE AND I CAN AFFORD TO GIVE YOU EIGHTY POUNDSFOR THE FIRST YEAR AND MORE AFTER.WHEN FRED MADE THE NECESSARY DISCLOSURE TO HIS PARENTS THE RELATIVEEFFECT ON THE TWO WAS A SURPRISE WHICH ENTERED VERY DEEPLY INTO HISMEMORY. HE WENT STRAIGHT FROM MR. GARTHS OFFICE TO THE WAREHOUSERIGHTLY FEELING THAT THE MOST RESPECTFUL WAY IN WHICH HE COULD BEHAVETO HIS FATHER WAS TO MAKE THE PAINFUL COMMUNICATION AS GRAVELY ANDFORMALLY AS POSSIBLE. MOREOVER THE DECISION WOULD BE MORE CERTAINLYUNDERSTOOD TO BE FINAL IF THE INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE IN HIS FATHERSGRAVEST HOURS WHICH WERE ALWAYS THOSE SPENT IN HIS PRIVATE ROOM AT THEWAREHOUSE.FRED ENTERED ON THE SUBJECT DIRECTLY AND DECLARED BRIEFLY WHAT HE HADDONE AND WAS RESOLVED TO DO EXPRESSING AT THE END HIS REGRET THAT HESHOULD BE THE CAUSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT TO HIS FATHER AND TAKING THEBLAME ON HIS OWN DEFICIENCIES. THE REGRET WAS GENUINE AND INSPIREDFRED WITH STRONG SIMPLE WORDS.MR. VINCY LISTENED IN PROFOUND SURPRISE WITHOUT UTTERING EVEN ANEXCLAMATION A SILENCE WHICH IN HIS IMPATIENT TEMPERAMENT WAS A SIGN OFUNUSUAL EMOTION. HE HAD NOT BEEN IN GOOD SPIRITS ABOUT TRADE THATMORNING AND THE SLIGHT BITTERNESS IN HIS LIPS GREW INTENSE AS HELISTENED. WHEN FRED HAD ENDED THERE WAS A PAUSE OF NEARLY A MINUTEDURING WHICH MR. VINCY REPLACED A BOOK IN HIS DESK AND TURNED THE KEYEMPHATICALLY. THEN HE LOOKED AT HIS SON STEADILY AND SAIDSO YOUVE MADE UP YOUR MIND AT LAST SIRYES FATHER.VERY WELL STICK TO IT. IVE NO MORE TO SAY. YOUVE THROWN AWAY YOUREDUCATION AND GONE DOWN A STEP IN LIFE WHEN I HAD GIVEN YOU THE MEANSOF RISING THATS ALL.I AM VERY SORRY THAT WE DIFFER FATHER. I THINK I CAN BE QUITE AS MUCHOF A GENTLEMAN AT THE WORK I HAVE UNDERTAKEN AS IF I HAD BEEN ACURATE. BUT I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR WISHING TO DO THE BEST FOR ME.VERY WELL I HAVE NO MORE TO SAY. I WASH MY HANDS OF YOU. I ONLY HOPEWHEN YOU HAVE A SON OF YOUR OWN HE WILL MAKE A BETTER RETURN FOR THEPAINS YOU SPEND ON HIM.THIS WAS VERY CUTTING TO FRED. HIS FATHER WAS USING THAT UNFAIRADVANTAGE POSSESSED BY US ALL WHEN WE ARE IN A PATHETIC SITUATION ANDSEE OUR OWN PAST AS IF IT WERE SIMPLY PART OF THE PATHOS. IN REALITYMR. VINCYS WISHES ABOUT HIS SON HAD HAD A GREAT DEAL OF PRIDEINCONSIDERATENESS AND EGOISTIC FOLLY IN THEM. BUT STILL THEDISAPPOINTED FATHER HELD A STRONG LEVER AND FRED FELT AS IF HE WEREBEING BANISHED WITH A MALEDICTION.I HOPE YOU WILL NOT OBJECT TO MY REMAINING AT HOME SIR HE SAIDAFTER RISING TO GO I SHALL HAVE A SUFFICIENT SALARY TO PAY FOR MYBOARD AS OF COURSE I SHOULD WISH TO DO.BOARD BE HANGED SAID MR. VINCY RECOVERING HIMSELF IN HIS DISGUST ATTHE NOTION THAT FREDS KEEP WOULD BE MISSED AT HIS TABLE. OF COURSEYOUR MOTHER WILL WANT YOU TO STAY. BUT I SHALL KEEP NO HORSE FOR YOUYOU UNDERSTAND AND YOU WILL PAY YOUR OWN TAILOR. YOU WILL DO WITH ASUIT OR TWO LESS I FANCY WHEN YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR EM.FRED LINGERED THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING TO BE SAID. AT LAST IT CAME.I HOPE YOU WILL SHAKE HANDS WITH ME FATHER AND FORGIVE ME THEVEXATION I HAVE CAUSED YOU.MR. VINCY FROM HIS CHAIR THREW A QUICK GLANCE UPWARD AT HIS SON WHOHAD ADVANCED NEAR TO HIM AND THEN GAVE HIS HAND SAYING HURRIEDLYYES YES LET US SAY NO MORE.FRED WENT THROUGH MUCH MORE NARRATIVE AND EXPLANATION WITH HIS MOTHERBUT SHE WAS INCONSOLABLE HAVING BEFORE HER EYES WHAT PERHAPS HERHUSBAND HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF THE CERTAINTY THAT FRED WOULD MARRY MARYGARTH THAT HER LIFE WOULD HENCEFORTH BE SPOILED BY A PERPETUALINFUSION OF GARTHS AND THEIR WAYS AND THAT HER DARLING BOY WITH HISBEAUTIFUL FACE AND STYLISH AIR BEYOND ANYBODY ELSES SON INMIDDLEMARCH WOULD BE SURE TO GET LIKE THAT FAMILY IN PLAINNESS OFAPPEARANCE AND CARELESSNESS ABOUT HIS CLOTHES. TO HER IT SEEMED THATTHERE WAS A GARTH CONSPIRACY TO GET POSSESSION OF THE DESIRABLE FREDBUT SHE DARED NOT ENLARGE ON THIS OPINION BECAUSE A SLIGHT HINT OF ITHAD MADE HIM FLY OUT AT HER AS HE HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE. HER TEMPERWAS TOO SWEET FOR HER TO SHOW ANY ANGER BUT SHE FELT THAT HERHAPPINESS HAD RECEIVED A BRUISE AND FOR SEVERAL DAYS MERELY TO LOOK ATFRED MADE HER CRY A LITTLE AS IF HE WERE THE SUBJECT OF SOME BALEFULPROPHECY. PERHAPS SHE WAS THE SLOWER TO RECOVER HER USUAL CHEERFULNESSBECAUSE FRED HAD WARNED HER THAT SHE MUST NOT REOPEN THE SORE QUESTIONWITH HIS FATHER WHO HAD ACCEPTED HIS DECISION AND FORGIVEN HIM. IF HERHUSBAND HAD BEEN VEHEMENT AGAINST FRED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN URGED INTODEFENCE OF HER DARLING. IT WAS THE END OF THE FOURTH DAY WHEN MR. VINCYSAID TO HERCOME LUCY MY DEAR DONT BE SO DOWNHEARTED.

THE BOOK AND THEY MUST PART BUT DAY BY DAY        IN LINES THAT THWART LIKE PORTLY SPIDERS RAN        THEY WROTE THE TALE FROM TULLY VEOLAN.THE EVENING THAT FRED VINCY WALKED TO LOWICK PARSONAGE HE HAD BEGUN TOSEE THAT THIS WAS A WORLD IN WHICH EVEN A SPIRITED YOUNG MAN MUSTSOMETIMES WALK FOR WANT OF A HORSE TO CARRY HIM HE SET OUT AT FIVEOCLOCK AND CALLED ON MRS. GARTH BY THE WAY WISHING TO ASSURE HIMSELFTHAT SHE ACCEPTED THEIR NEW RELATIONS WILLINGLY.HE FOUND THE FAMILY GROUP DOGS AND CATS INCLUDED UNDER THE GREATAPPLETREE IN THE ORCHARD. IT WAS A FESTIVAL WITH MRS. GARTH FOR HERELDEST SON CHRISTY HER PECULIAR JOY AND PRIDE HAD COME HOME FOR ASHORT HOLIDAYCHRISTY WHO HELD IT THE MOST DESIRABLE THING IN THEWORLD TO BE A TUTOR TO STUDY ALL LITERATURES AND BE A REGENERATEPORSON AND WHO WAS AN INCORPORATE CRITICISM ON POOR FRED A SORT OFOBJECTLESSON GIVEN TO HIM BY THE EDUCATIONAL MOTHER. CHRISTY HIMSELFA SQUAREBROWED BROADSHOULDERED MASCULINE EDITION OF HIS MOTHER NOTMUCH HIGHER THAN FREDS SHOULDERWHICH MADE IT THE HARDER THAT HESHOULD BE HELD SUPERIORWAS ALWAYS AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE AND THOUGHTNO MORE OF FREDS DISINCLINATION TO SCHOLARSHIP THAN OF A GIRAFFESWISHING THAT HE HIMSELF WERE MORE OF THE SAME HEIGHT. HE WAS LYING ONTHE GROUND NOW BY HIS MOTHERS CHAIR WITH HIS STRAW HAT LAID FLAT OVERHIS EYES WHILE JIM ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS READING ALOUD FROM THATBELOVED WRITER WHO HAS MADE A CHIEF PART IN THE HAPPINESS OF MANY YOUNGLIVES. THE VOLUME WAS IVANHOE AND JIM WAS IN THE GREAT ARCHERY SCENEAT THE TOURNAMENT BUT SUFFERED MUCH INTERRUPTION FROM BEN WHO HADFETCHED HIS OWN OLD BOW AND ARROWS AND WAS MAKING HIMSELF DREADFULLYDISAGREEABLE LETTY THOUGHT BY BEGGING ALL PRESENT TO OBSERVE HISRANDOM SHOTS WHICH NO ONE WISHED TO DO EXCEPT BROWNIE THEACTIVEMINDED BUT PROBABLY SHALLOW MONGREL WHILE THE GRIZZLEDNEWFOUNDLAND LYING IN THE SUN LOOKED ON WITH THE DULLEYED NEUTRALITYOF EXTREME OLD AGE. LETTY HERSELF SHOWING AS TO HER MOUTH AND PINAFORESOME SLIGHT SIGNS THAT SHE HAD BEEN ASSISTING AT THE GATHERING OF THECHERRIES WHICH STOOD IN A CORALHEAP ON THE TEATABLE WAS NOW SEATEDON THE GRASS LISTENING OPENEYED TO THE READING.BUT THE CENTRE OF INTEREST WAS CHANGED FOR ALL BY THE ARRIVAL OF FREDVINCY. WHEN SEATING HIMSELF ON A GARDENSTOOL HE SAID THAT HE WAS ONHIS WAY TO LOWICK PARSONAGE BEN WHO HAD THROWN DOWN HIS BOW ANDSNATCHED UP A RELUCTANT HALFGROWN KITTEN INSTEAD STRODE ACROSS FREDSOUTSTRETCHED LEG AND SAID TAKE MEOH AND ME TOO SAID LETTY.YOU CANT KEEP UP WITH FRED AND ME SAID BEN.YES I CAN. MOTHER PLEASE SAY THAT I AM TO GO URGED LETTY WHOSELIFE WAS MUCH CHECKERED BY RESISTANCE TO HER DEPRECIATION AS A GIRL.I SHALL STAY WITH CHRISTY OBSERVED JIM AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT HEHAD THE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE SIMPLETONS WHEREUPON LETTY PUT HER HAND UPTO HER HEAD AND LOOKED WITH JEALOUS INDECISION FROM THE ONE TO THEOTHER.LET US ALL GO AND SEE MARY SAID CHRISTY OPENING HIS ARMS.NO MY DEAR CHILD WE MUST NOT GO IN A SWARM TO THE PARSONAGE. ANDTHAT OLD GLASGOW SUIT OF YOURS WOULD NEVER DO. BESIDES YOUR FATHERWILL COME HOME. WE MUST LET FRED GO ALONE. HE CAN TELL MARY THAT YOUARE HERE AND SHE WILL COME BACK TOMORROW.CHRISTY GLANCED AT HIS OWN THREADBARE KNEES AND THEN AT FREDSBEAUTIFUL WHITE TROUSERS. CERTAINLY FREDS TAILORING SUGGESTED THEADVANTAGES OF AN ENGLISH UNIVERSITY AND HE HAD A GRACEFUL WAY EVEN OFLOOKING WARM AND OF PUSHING HIS HAIR BACK WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF.CHILDREN RUN AWAY SAID MRS. GARTH IT IS TOO WARM TO HANG ABOUTYOUR FRIENDS. TAKE YOUR BROTHER AND SHOW HIM THE RABBITS.THE ELDEST UNDERSTOOD AND LED OFF THE CHILDREN IMMEDIATELY. FRED FELTTHAT MRS. GARTH WISHED TO GIVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING ANYTHING HEHAD TO SAY BUT HE COULD ONLY BEGIN BY OBSERVINGHOW GLAD YOU MUST BE TO HAVE CHRISTY HEREYES HE HAS COME SOONER THAN I EXPECTED. HE GOT DOWN FROM THE COACH ATNINE OCLOCK JUST AFTER HIS FATHER WENT OUT. I AM LONGING FOR CALEB TOCOME AND HEAR WHAT WONDERFUL PROGRESS CHRISTY IS MAKING. HE HAS PAIDHIS EXPENSES FOR THE LAST YEAR BY GIVING LESSONS CARRYING ON HARDSTUDY AT THE SAME TIME. HE HOPES SOON TO GET A PRIVATE TUTORSHIP AND GOABROAD.HE IS A GREAT FELLOW SAID FRED TO WHOM THESE CHEERFUL TRUTHS HAD AMEDICINAL TASTE AND NO TROUBLE TO ANYBODY. AFTER A SLIGHT PAUSE HEADDED BUT I FEAR YOU WILL THINK THAT I AM GOING TO BE A GREAT DEAL OFTROUBLE TO MR. GARTH.CALEB LIKES TAKING TROUBLE HE IS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO ALWAYS DO MORETHAN ANY ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF ASKING THEM TO DO ANSWERED MRS.GARTH. SHE WAS KNITTING AND COULD EITHER LOOK AT FRED OR NOT AS SHECHOSEALWAYS AN ADVANTAGE WHEN ONE IS BENT ON LOADING SPEECH WITHSALUTARY MEANING AND THOUGH MRS. GARTH INTENDED TO BE DULY RESERVEDSHE DID WISH TO SAY SOMETHING THAT FRED MIGHT BE THE BETTER FOR.I KNOW YOU THINK ME VERY UNDESERVING MRS. GARTH AND WITH GOODREASON SAID FRED HIS SPIRIT RISING A LITTLE AT THE PERCEPTION OFSOMETHING LIKE A DISPOSITION TO LECTURE HIM. I HAPPEN TO HAVE BEHAVEDJUST THE WORST TO THE PEOPLE I CANT HELP WISHING FOR THE MOST FROM.BUT WHILE TWO MEN LIKE MR. GARTH AND MR. FAREBROTHER HAVE NOT GIVEN MEUP I DONT SEE WHY I SHOULD GIVE MYSELF UP. FRED THOUGHT IT MIGHT BEWELL TO SUGGEST THESE MASCULINE EXAMPLES TO MRS. GARTH.ASSUREDLY SAID SHE WITH GATHERING EMPHASIS. A YOUNG MAN FOR WHOMTWO SUCH ELDERS HAD DEVOTED THEMSELVES WOULD INDEED BE CULPABLE IF HETHREW HIMSELF AWAY AND MADE THEIR SACRIFICES VAIN.FRED WONDERED A LITTLE AT THIS STRONG LANGUAGE BUT ONLY SAID I HOPEIT WILL NOT BE SO WITH ME MRS. GARTH SINCE I HAVE SOME ENCOURAGEMENTTO BELIEVE THAT I MAY WIN MARY. MR. GARTH HAS TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT YOUWERE NOT SURPRISED I DARE SAY FRED ENDED INNOCENTLY REFERRING ONLYTO HIS OWN LOVE AS PROBABLY EVIDENT ENOUGH.NOT SURPRISED THAT MARY HAS GIVEN YOU ENCOURAGEMENT RETURNED MRS.GARTH WHO THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR FRED TO BE MORE ALIVE TO THEFACT THAT MARYS FRIENDS COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE WISHED THISBEFOREHAND WHATEVER THE VINCYS MIGHT SUPPOSE. YES I CONFESS I WASSURPRISED.SHE NEVER DID GIVE ME ANYNOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD WHEN I TALKED TOHER MYSELF SAID FRED EAGER TO VINDICATE MARY. BUT WHEN I ASKED MR.FAREBROTHER TO SPEAK FOR ME SHE ALLOWED HIM TO TELL ME THERE WAS AHOPE.THE POWER OF ADMONITION WHICH HAD BEGUN TO STIR IN MRS. GARTH HAD NOTYET DISCHARGED ITSELF. IT WAS A LITTLE TOO PROVOKING EVEN FOR HERSELFCONTROL THAT THIS BLOOMING YOUNGSTER SHOULD FLOURISH ON THEDISAPPOINTMENTS OF SADDER AND WISER PEOPLEMAKING A MEAL OF ANIGHTINGALE AND NEVER KNOWING ITAND THAT ALL THE WHILE HIS FAMILYSHOULD SUPPOSE THAT HERS WAS IN EAGER NEED OF THIS SPRIG AND HERVEXATION HAD FERMENTED THE MORE ACTIVELY BECAUSE OF ITS TOTALREPRESSION TOWARDS HER HUSBAND. EXEMPLARY WIVES WILL SOMETIMES FINDSCAPEGOATS IN THIS WAY. SHE NOW SAID WITH ENERGETIC DECISION YOU MADEA GREAT MISTAKE FRED IN ASKING MR. FAREBROTHER TO SPEAK FOR YOU.DID I SAID FRED REDDENING INSTANTANEOUSLY. HE WAS ALARMED BUT AT ALOSS TO KNOW WHAT MRS. GARTH MEANT AND ADDED IN AN APOLOGETIC TONEMR. FAREBROTHER HAS ALWAYS BEEN SUCH A FRIEND OF OURS AND MARY IKNEW WOULD LISTEN TO HIM GRAVELY AND HE TOOK IT ON HIMSELF QUITEREADILY.YES YOUNG PEOPLE ARE USUALLY BLIND TO EVERYTHING BUT THEIR OWNWISHES AND SELDOM IMAGINE HOW MUCH THOSE WISHES COST OTHERS SAIDMRS. GARTH. SHE DID NOT MEAN TO GO BEYOND THIS SALUTARY GENERALDOCTRINE AND THREW HER INDIGNATION INTO A NEEDLESS UNWINDING OF HERWORSTED KNITTING HER BROW AT IT WITH A GRAND AIR.I CANNOT CONCEIVE HOW IT COULD BE ANY PAIN TO MR. FAREBROTHER SAIDFRED WHO NEVERTHELESS FELT THAT SURPRISING CONCEPTIONS WERE BEGINNINGTO FORM THEMSELVES.PRECISELY YOU CANNOT CONCEIVE SAID MRS. GARTH CUTTING HER WORDS ASNEATLY AS POSSIBLE.FOR A MOMENT FRED LOOKED AT THE HORIZON WITH A DISMAYED ANXIETY ANDTHEN TURNING WITH A QUICK MOVEMENT SAID ALMOST SHARPLYDO YOU MEAN TO SAY MRS. GARTH THAT MR. FAREBROTHER IS IN LOVE WITHMARYAND IF IT WERE SO FRED I THINK YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON WHO OUGHT TOBE SURPRISED RETURNED MRS. GARTH LAYING HER KNITTING DOWN BESIDE HERAND FOLDING HER ARMS. IT WAS AN UNWONTED SIGN OF EMOTION IN HER THATSHE SHOULD PUT HER WORK OUT OF HER HANDS. IN FACT HER FEELINGS WEREDIVIDED BETWEEN THE SATISFACTION OF GIVING FRED HIS DISCIPLINE AND THESENSE OF HAVING GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR. FRED TOOK HIS HAT AND STICK ANDROSE QUICKLY.THEN YOU THINK I AM STANDING IN HIS WAY AND IN MARYS TOO HE SAIDIN A TONE WHICH SEEMED TO DEMAND AN ANSWER.MRS. GARTH COULD NOT SPEAK IMMEDIATELY. SHE HAD BROUGHT HERSELF INTOTHE UNPLEASANT POSITION OF BEING CALLED ON TO SAY WHAT SHE REALLY FELTYET WHAT SHE KNEW THERE WERE STRONG REASONS FOR CONCEALING. AND TO HERTHE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING EXCEEDED IN WORDS WAS PECULIARLYMORTIFYING. BESIDES FRED HAD GIVEN OUT UNEXPECTED ELECTRICITY AND HENOW ADDED MR. GARTH SEEMED PLEASED THAT MARY SHOULD BE ATTACHED TOME. HE COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN ANYTHING OF THIS.MRS. GARTH FELT A SEVERE TWINGE AT THIS MENTION OF HER HUSBAND THEFEAR THAT CALEB MIGHT THINK HER IN THE WRONG NOT BEING EASILYENDURABLE. SHE ANSWERED WANTING TO CHECK UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCESI SPOKE FROM INFERENCE ONLY. I AM NOT AWARE THAT MARY KNOWS ANYTHINGOF THE MATTER.BUT SHE HESITATED TO BEG THAT HE WOULD KEEP ENTIRE SILENCE ON A SUBJECTWHICH SHE HAD HERSELF UNNECESSARILY MENTIONED NOT BEING USED TO STOOPIN THAT WAY AND WHILE SHE WAS HESITATING THERE WAS ALREADY A RUSH OFUNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES UNDER THE APPLETREE WHERE THE TEATHINGSSTOOD. BEN BOUNCING ACROSS THE GRASS WITH BROWNIE AT HIS HEELS ANDSEEING THE KITTEN DRAGGING THE KNITTING BY A LENGTHENING LINE OF WOOLSHOUTED AND CLAPPED HIS HANDS BROWNIE BARKED THE KITTEN DESPERATEJUMPED ON THE TEATABLE AND UPSET THE MILK THEN JUMPED DOWN AGAIN ANDSWEPT HALF THE CHERRIES WITH IT AND BEN SNATCHING UP THE HALFKNITTEDSOCKTOP FITTED IT OVER THE KITTENS HEAD AS A NEW SOURCE OF MADNESSWHILE LETTY ARRIVING CRIED OUT TO HER MOTHER AGAINST THIS CRUELTYITWAS A HISTORY AS FULL OF SENSATION AS THIS IS THE HOUSE THAT JACKBUILT. MRS. GARTH WAS OBLIGED TO INTERFERE THE OTHER YOUNG ONES CAMEUP AND THE TTETTE WITH FRED WAS ENDED. HE GOT AWAY AS SOON AS HECOULD AND MRS. GARTH COULD ONLY IMPLY SOME RETRACTATION OF HERSEVERITY BY SAYING GOD BLESS YOU WHEN SHE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM.SHE WAS UNPLEASANTLY CONSCIOUS THAT SHE HAD BEEN ON THE VERGE OFSPEAKING AS ONE OF THE FOOLISH WOMEN SPEAKETHTELLING FIRST ANDENTREATING SILENCE AFTER. BUT SHE HAD NOT ENTREATED SILENCE AND TOPREVENT CALEBS BLAME SHE DETERMINED TO BLAME HERSELF AND CONFESS ALLTO HIM THAT VERY NIGHT. IT WAS CURIOUS WHAT AN AWFUL TRIBUNAL THE MILDCALEBS WAS TO HER WHENEVER HE SET IT UP. BUT SHE MEANT TO POINT OUTTO HIM THAT THE REVELATION MIGHT DO FRED VINCY A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD.NO DOUBT IT WAS HAVING A STRONG EFFECT ON HIM AS HE WALKED TO LOWICK.FREDS LIGHT HOPEFUL NATURE HAD PERHAPS NEVER HAD SO MUCH OF A BRUISEAS FROM THIS SUGGESTION THAT IF HE HAD BEEN OUT OF THE WAY MARY MIGHTHAVE MADE A THOROUGHLY GOOD MATCH. ALSO HE WAS PIQUED THAT HE HAD BEENWHAT HE CALLED SUCH A STUPID LOUT AS TO ASK THAT INTERVENTION FROM MR.FAREBROTHER. BUT IT WAS NOT IN A LOVERS NATUREIT WAS NOT IN FREDSTHAT THE NEW ANXIETY RAISED ABOUT MARYS FEELING SHOULD NOT SURMOUNTEVERY OTHER. NOTWITHSTANDING HIS TRUST IN MR. FAREBROTHERS GENEROSITYNOTWITHSTANDING WHAT MARY HAD SAID TO HIM FRED COULD NOT HELP FEELINGTHAT HE HAD A RIVAL IT WAS A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS AND HE OBJECTED TO ITEXTREMELY NOT BEING IN THE LEAST READY TO GIVE UP MARY FOR HER GOODBEING READY RATHER TO FIGHT FOR HER WITH ANY MAN WHATSOEVER. BUT THEFIGHTING WITH MR. FAREBROTHER MUST BE OF A METAPHORICAL KIND WHICH WASMUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO FRED THAN THE MUSCULAR. CERTAINLY THISEXPERIENCE WAS A DISCIPLINE FOR FRED HARDLY LESS SHARP THAN HISDISAPPOINTMENT ABOUT HIS UNCLES WILL. THE IRON HAD NOT ENTERED INTOHIS SOUL BUT HE HAD BEGUN TO IMAGINE WHAT THE SHARP EDGE WOULD BE. ITDID NOT ONCE OCCUR TO FRED THAT MRS. GARTH MIGHT BE MISTAKEN ABOUT MR.FAREBROTHER BUT HE SUSPECTED THAT SHE MIGHT BE WRONG ABOUT MARY. MARYHAD BEEN STAYING AT THE PARSONAGE LATELY AND HER MOTHER MIGHT KNOWVERY LITTLE OF WHAT HAD BEEN PASSING IN HER MIND.HE DID NOT FEEL EASIER WHEN HE FOUND HER LOOKING CHEERFUL WITH THETHREE LADIES IN THE DRAWINGROOM. THEY WERE IN ANIMATED DISCUSSION ONSOME SUBJECT WHICH WAS DROPPED WHEN HE ENTERED AND MARY WAS COPYINGTHE LABELS FROM A HEAP OF SHALLOW CABINET DRAWERS IN A MINUTEHANDWRITING WHICH SHE WAS SKILLED IN. MR. FAREBROTHER WAS SOMEWHERE INTHE VILLAGE AND THE THREE LADIES KNEW NOTHING OF FREDS PECULIARRELATION TO MARY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR EITHER OF THEM TO PROPOSE THATTHEY SHOULD WALK ROUND THE GARDEN AND FRED PREDICTED TO HIMSELF THATHE SHOULD HAVE TO GO AWAY WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO HER IN PRIVATE. HETOLD HER FIRST OF CHRISTYS ARRIVAL AND THEN OF HIS OWN ENGAGEMENT WITHHER FATHER AND HE WAS COMFORTED BY SEEING THAT THIS LATTER NEWSTOUCHED HER KEENLY. SHE SAID HURRIEDLY I AM SO GLAD AND THEN BENTOVER HER WRITING TO HINDER ANY ONE FROM NOTICING HER FACE. BUT HERE WASA SUBJECT WHICH MRS. FAREBROTHER COULD NOT LET PASS.YOU DONT MEAN MY DEAR MISS GARTH THAT YOU ARE GLAD TO HEAR OF AYOUNG MAN GIVING UP THE CHURCH FOR WHICH HE WAS EDUCATED YOU ONLY MEANTHAT THINGS BEING SO YOU ARE GLAD THAT HE SHOULD BE UNDER AN EXCELLENTMAN LIKE YOUR FATHER.NO REALLY MRS. FAREBROTHER I AM GLAD OF BOTH I FEAR SAID MARYCLEVERLY GETTING RID OF ONE REBELLIOUS TEAR. I HAVE A DREADFULLYSECULAR MIND. I NEVER LIKED ANY CLERGYMAN EXCEPT THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELDAND MR. FAREBROTHER.NOW WHY MY DEAR SAID MRS. FAREBROTHER PAUSING ON HER LARGE WOODENKNITTINGNEEDLES AND LOOKING AT MARY. YOU HAVE ALWAYS A GOOD REASONFOR YOUR OPINIONS BUT THIS ASTONISHES ME. OF COURSE I PUT OUT OF THEQUESTION THOSE WHO PREACH NEW DOCTRINE. BUT WHY SHOULD YOU DISLIKECLERGYMENOH DEAR SAID MARY HER FACE BREAKING INTO MERRIMENT AS SHE SEEMED TOCONSIDER A MOMENT I DONT LIKE THEIR NECKCLOTHS.WHY YOU DONT LIKE CAMDENS THEN SAID MISS WINIFRED IN SOMEANXIETY.YES I DO SAID MARY. I DONT LIKE THE OTHER CLERGYMENS NECKCLOTHSBECAUSE IT IS THEY WHO WEAR THEM.HOW VERY PUZZLING SAID MISS NOBLE FEELING THAT HER OWN INTELLECTWAS PROBABLY DEFICIENT.MY DEAR YOU ARE JOKING. YOU WOULD HAVE BETTER REASONS THAN THESE FORSLIGHTING SO RESPECTABLE A CLASS OF MEN SAID MRS. FAREBROTHERMAJESTICALLY.MISS GARTH HAS SUCH SEVERE NOTIONS OF WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE THAT IT ISDIFFICULT TO SATISFY HER SAID FRED.WELL I AM GLAD AT LEAST THAT SHE MAKES AN EXCEPTION IN FAVOR OF MYSON SAID THE OLD LADY.MARY WAS WONDERING AT FREDS PIQUED TONE WHEN MR. FAREBROTHER CAME INAND HAD TO HEAR THE NEWS ABOUT THE ENGAGEMENT UNDER MR. GARTH. AT THEEND HE SAID WITH QUIET SATISFACTION THAT IS RIGHT AND THEN BENTTO LOOK AT MARYS LABELS AND PRAISE HER HANDWRITING. FRED FELT HORRIBLYJEALOUSWAS GLAD OF COURSE THAT MR. FAREBROTHER WAS SO ESTIMABLE BUTWISHED THAT HE HAD BEEN UGLY AND FAT AS MEN AT FORTY SOMETIMES ARE. ITWAS CLEAR WHAT THE END WOULD BE SINCE MARY OPENLY PLACED FAREBROTHERABOVE EVERYBODY AND THESE WOMEN WERE ALL EVIDENTLY ENCOURAGING THEAFFAIR. HE WAS FEELING SURE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE NO CHANCE OF SPEAKINGTO MARY WHEN MR. FAREBROTHER SAIDFRED HELP ME TO CARRY THESE DRAWERS BACK INTO MY STUDYYOU HAVE NEVERSEEN MY FINE NEW STUDY. PRAY COME TOO MISS GARTH. I WANT YOU TO SEE ASTUPENDOUS SPIDER I FOUND THIS MORNING.MARY AT ONCE SAW THE VICARS INTENTION. HE HAD NEVER SINCE THEMEMORABLE EVENING DEVIATED FROM HIS OLD PASTORAL KINDNESS TOWARDS HERAND HER MOMENTARY WONDER AND DOUBT HAD QUITE GONE TO SLEEP. MARY WASACCUSTOMED TO THINK RATHER RIGOROUSLY OF WHAT WAS PROBABLE AND IF ABELIEF FLATTERED HER VANITY SHE FELT WARNED TO DISMISS IT ASRIDICULOUS HAVING EARLY HAD MUCH EXERCISE IN SUCH DISMISSALS. IT WASAS SHE HAD FORESEEN WHEN FRED HAD BEEN ASKED TO ADMIRE THE FITTINGS OFTHE STUDY AND SHE HAD BEEN ASKED TO ADMIRE THE SPIDER MR. FAREBROTHERSAIDWAIT HERE A MINUTE OR TWO. I AM GOING TO LOOK OUT AN ENGRAVING WHICHFRED IS TALL ENOUGH TO HANG FOR ME. I SHALL BE BACK IN A FEW MINUTES.AND THEN HE WENT OUT. NEVERTHELESS THE FIRST WORD FRED SAID TO MARYWASIT IS OF NO USE WHATEVER I DO MARY. YOU ARE SURE TO MARRYFAREBROTHER AT LAST. THERE WAS SOME RAGE IN HIS TONE.WHAT DO YOU MEAN FRED MARY EXCLAIMED INDIGNANTLY BLUSHING DEEPLYAND SURPRISED OUT OF ALL HER READINESS IN REPLY.IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SEE IT ALL CLEARLY ENOUGHYOU WHOSEE EVERYTHING.I ONLY SEE THAT YOU ARE BEHAVING VERY ILL FRED IN SPEAKING SO OF MR.FAREBROTHER AFTER HE HAS PLEADED YOUR CAUSE IN EVERY WAY. HOW CAN YOUHAVE TAKEN UP SUCH AN IDEAFRED WAS RATHER DEEP IN SPITE OF HIS IRRITATION. IF MARY HAD REALLYBEEN UNSUSPICIOUS THERE WAS NO GOOD IN TELLING HER WHAT MRS. GARTH HADSAID.IT FOLLOWS AS A MATTER OF COURSE HE REPLIED. WHEN YOU ARECONTINUALLY SEEING A MAN WHO BEATS ME IN EVERYTHING AND WHOM YOU SETUP ABOVE EVERYBODY I CAN HAVE NO FAIR CHANCE.YOU ARE VERY UNGRATEFUL FRED SAID MARY. I WISH I HAD NEVER TOLDMR. FAREBROTHER THAT I CARED FOR YOU IN THE LEAST.NO I AM NOT UNGRATEFUL I SHOULD BE THE HAPPIEST FELLOW IN THE WORLDIF IT WERE NOT FOR THIS. I TOLD YOUR FATHER EVERYTHING AND HE WAS VERYKIND HE TREATED ME AS IF I WERE HIS SON. I COULD GO AT THE WORK WITH AWILL WRITING AND EVERYTHING IF IT WERE NOT FOR THIS.FOR THIS FOR WHAT SAID MARY IMAGINING NOW THAT SOMETHING SPECIFICMUST HAVE BEEN SAID OR DONE.THIS DREADFUL CERTAINTY THAT I SHALL BE BOWLED OUT BY FAREBROTHER.MARY WAS APPEASED BY HER INCLINATION TO LAUGH.FRED SHE SAID PEEPING ROUND TO CATCH HIS EYES WHICH WERE SULKILYTURNED AWAY FROM HER YOU ARE TOO DELIGHTFULLY RIDICULOUS. IF YOU WERENOT SUCH A CHARMING SIMPLETON WHAT A TEMPTATION THIS WOULD BE TO PLAYTHE WICKED COQUETTE AND LET YOU SUPPOSE THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES YOU HASMADE LOVE TO ME.DO YOU REALLY LIKE ME BEST MARY SAID FRED TURNING EYES FULL OFAFFECTION ON HER AND TRYING TO TAKE HER HAND.I DONT LIKE YOU AT ALL AT THIS MOMENT SAID MARY RETREATING ANDPUTTING HER HANDS BEHIND HER. I ONLY SAID THAT NO MORTAL EVER MADELOVE TO ME BESIDES YOU. AND THAT IS NO ARGUMENT THAT A VERY WISE MANEVER WILL SHE ENDED MERRILY.I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME THAT YOU COULD NOT POSSIBLY EVER THINK OFHIM SAID FRED.NEVER DARE TO MENTION THIS ANY MORE TO ME FRED SAID MARY GETTINGSERIOUS AGAIN. I DONT KNOW WHETHER IT IS MORE STUPID OR UNGENEROUS INYOU NOT TO SEE THAT MR. FAREBROTHER HAS LEFT US TOGETHER ON PURPOSETHAT WE MIGHT SPEAK FREELY. I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU SHOULD BE SOBLIND TO HIS DELICATE FEELING.THERE WAS NO TIME TO SAY ANY MORE BEFORE MR. FAREBROTHER CAME BACK WITHTHE ENGRAVING AND FRED HAD TO RETURN TO THE DRAWINGROOM STILL WITH AJEALOUS DREAD IN HIS HEART BUT YET WITH COMFORTING ARGUMENTS FROMMARYS WORDS AND MANNER. THE RESULT OF THE CONVERSATION WAS ON THEWHOLE MORE PAINFUL TO MARY INEVITABLY HER ATTENTION HAD TAKEN A NEWATTITUDE AND SHE SAW THE POSSIBILITY OF NEW INTERPRETATIONS. SHE WASIN A POSITION IN WHICH SHE SEEMED TO HERSELF TO BE SLIGHTING MR.FAREBROTHER AND THIS IN RELATION TO A MAN WHO IS MUCH HONORED ISALWAYS DANGEROUS TO THE FIRMNESS OF A GRATEFUL WOMAN. TO HAVE A REASONFOR GOING HOME THE NEXT DAY WAS A RELIEF FOR MARY EARNESTLY DESIRED TOBE ALWAYS CLEAR THAT SHE LOVED FRED BEST. WHEN A TENDER AFFECTION HASBEEN STORING ITSELF IN US THROUGH MANY OF OUR YEARS THE IDEA THAT WECOULD ACCEPT ANY EXCHANGE FOR IT SEEMS TO BE A CHEAPENING OF OUR LIVES.AND WE CAN SET A WATCH OVER OUR AFFECTIONS AND OUR CONSTANCY AS WE CANOVER OTHER TREASURES.FRED HAS LOST ALL HIS OTHER EXPECTATIONS HE MUST KEEP THIS MARYSAID TO HERSELF WITH A SMILE CURLING HER LIPS. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TOHELP FLEETING VISIONS OF ANOTHER KINDNEW DIGNITIES AND AN ACKNOWLEDGEDVALUE OF WHICH SHE HAD OFTEN FELT THE ABSENCE. BUT THESE THINGS WITHFRED OUTSIDE THEM FRED FORSAKEN AND LOOKING SAD FOR THE WANT OF HERCOULD NEVER TEMPT HER DELIBERATE THOUGHT.CHAPTER LVIII.FOR THERE CAN LIVE NO HATRED IN THINE EYETHEREFORE IN THAT I CANNOT KNOW THY CHANGEIN MANYS LOOKS THE FALSE HEARTS HISTORYIS WRIT IN MOODS AND FROWNS AND WRINKLES STRANGEBUT HEAVEN IN THY CREATION DID DECREETHAT IN THY FACE SWEET LOVE SHOULD EVER DWELLWHATEER THY THOUGHTS OR THY HEARTS WORKINGS BETHY LOOKS SHOULD NOTHING THENCE BUT SWEETNESS TELL.SHAKESPEARE SONNETS.AT THE TIME WHEN MR. VINCY UTTERED THAT PRESENTIMENT ABOUT ROSAMONDSHE HERSELF HAD NEVER HAD THE IDEA THAT SHE SHOULD BE DRIVEN TO MAKETHE SORT OF APPEAL WHICH HE FORESAW. SHE HAD NOT YET HAD ANY ANXIETYABOUT WAYS AND MEANS ALTHOUGH HER DOMESTIC LIFE HAD BEEN EXPENSIVE ASWELL AS EVENTFUL. HER BABY HAD BEEN BORN PREMATURELY AND ALL THEEMBROIDERED ROBES AND CAPS HAD TO BE LAID BY IN DARKNESS. THISMISFORTUNE WAS ATTRIBUTED ENTIRELY TO HER HAVING PERSISTED IN GOING OUTON HORSEBACK ONE DAY WHEN HER HUSBAND HAD DESIRED HER NOT TO DO SO BUTIT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT SHE HAD SHOWN TEMPER ON THE OCCASION ORRUDELY TOLD HIM THAT SHE WOULD DO AS SHE LIKED.WHAT LED HER PARTICULARLY TO DESIRE HORSEEXERCISE WAS A VISIT FROMCAPTAIN LYDGATE THE BARONETS THIRD SON WHO I AM SORRY TO SAY WASDETESTED BY OUR TERTIUS OF THAT NAME AS A VAPID FOP PARTING HIS HAIRFROM BROW TO NAPE IN A DESPICABLE FASHION NOT FOLLOWED BY TERTIUSHIMSELF AND SHOWING AN IGNORANT SECURITY THAT HE KNEW THE PROPERTHING TO SAY ON EVERY TOPIC. LYDGATE INWARDLY CURSED HIS OWN FOLLY THATHE HAD DRAWN DOWN THIS VISIT BY CONSENTING TO GO TO HIS UNCLES ON THEWEDDINGTOUR AND HE MADE HIMSELF RATHER DISAGREEABLE TO ROSAMOND BYSAYING SO IN PRIVATE. FOR TO ROSAMOND THIS VISIT WAS A SOURCE OFUNPRECEDENTED BUT GRACEFULLY CONCEALED EXULTATION. SHE WAS SO INTENSELYCONSCIOUS OF HAVING A COUSIN WHO WAS A BARONETS SON STAYING IN THEHOUSE THAT SHE IMAGINED THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WAS IMPLIED BY HISPRESENCE TO BE DIFFUSED THROUGH ALL OTHER MINDS AND WHEN SHEINTRODUCED CAPTAIN LYDGATE TO HER GUESTS SHE HAD A PLACID SENSE THATHIS RANK PENETRATED THEM AS IF IT HAD BEEN AN ODOR. THE SATISFACTIONWAS ENOUGH FOR THE TIME TO MELT AWAY SOME DISAPPOINTMENT IN THECONDITIONS OF MARRIAGE WITH A MEDICAL MAN EVEN OF GOOD BIRTH IT SEEMEDNOW THAT HER MARRIAGE WAS VISIBLY AS WELL AS IDEALLY FLOATING HER ABOVETHE MIDDLEMARCH LEVEL AND THE FUTURE LOOKED BRIGHT WITH LETTERS ANDVISITS TO AND FROM QUALLINGHAM AND VAGUE ADVANCEMENT IN CONSEQUENCEFOR TERTIUS. ESPECIALLY AS PROBABLY AT THE CAPTAINS SUGGESTION HISMARRIED SISTER MRS. MENGAN HAD COME WITH HER MAID AND STAYED TWONIGHTS ON HER WAY FROM TOWN. HENCE IT WAS CLEARLY WORTH WHILE FORROSAMOND TO TAKE PAINS WITH HER MUSIC AND THE CAREFUL SELECTION OF HERLACE.AS TO CAPTAIN LYDGATE HIMSELF HIS LOW BROW HIS AQUILINE NOSE BENT ONONE SIDE AND HIS RATHER HEAVY UTTERANCE MIGHT HAVE BEENDISADVANTAGEOUS IN ANY YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO HAD NOT A MILITARY BEARINGAND MUSTACHE TO GIVE HIM WHAT IS DOTED ON BY SOME FLOWERLIKE BLONDHEADS AS STYLE. HE HAD MOREOVER THAT SORT OF HIGHBREEDING WHICHCONSISTS IN BEING FREE FROM THE PETTY SOLICITUDES OF MIDDLECLASSGENTILITY AND HE WAS A GREAT CRITIC OF FEMININE CHARMS. ROSAMONDDELIGHTED IN HIS ADMIRATION NOW EVEN MORE THAN SHE HAD DONE ATQUALLINGHAM AND HE FOUND IT EASY TO SPEND SEVERAL HOURS OF THE DAY INFLIRTING WITH HER. THE VISIT ALTOGETHER WAS ONE OF THE PLEASANTESTLARKS HE HAD EVER HAD NOT THE LESS SO PERHAPS BECAUSE HE SUSPECTEDTHAT HIS QUEER COUSIN TERTIUS WISHED HIM AWAY THOUGH LYDGATE WHOWOULD RATHER HYPERBOLICALLY SPEAKING HAVE DIED THAN HAVE FAILED INPOLITE HOSPITALITY SUPPRESSED HIS DISLIKE AND ONLY PRETENDEDGENERALLY NOT TO HEAR WHAT THE GALLANT OFFICER SAID CONSIGNING THETASK OF ANSWERING HIM TO ROSAMOND. FOR HE WAS NOT AT ALL A JEALOUSHUSBAND AND PREFERRED LEAVING A FEATHERHEADED YOUNG GENTLEMAN ALONEWITH HIS WIFE TO BEARING HIM COMPANY.I WISH YOU WOULD TALK MORE TO THE CAPTAIN AT DINNER TERTIUS SAIDROSAMOND ONE EVENING WHEN THE IMPORTANT GUEST WAS GONE TO LOAMFORD TOSEE SOME BROTHER OFFICERS STATIONED THERE. YOU REALLY LOOK SO ABSENTSOMETIMESYOU SEEM TO BE SEEING THROUGH HIS HEAD INTO SOMETHING BEHINDIT INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT HIM.MY DEAR ROSY YOU DONT EXPECT ME TO TALK MUCH TO SUCH A CONCEITED ASSAS THAT I HOPE SAID LYDGATE BRUSQUELY. IF HE GOT HIS HEAD BROKENI MIGHT LOOK AT IT WITH INTEREST NOT BEFORE.I CANNOT CONCEIVE WHY YOU SHOULD SPEAK OF YOUR COUSIN SOCONTEMPTUOUSLY SAID ROSAMOND HER FINGERS MOVING AT HER WORK WHILESHE SPOKE WITH A MILD GRAVITY WHICH HAD A TOUCH OF DISDAIN IN IT.ASK LADISLAW IF HE DOESNT THINK YOUR CAPTAIN THE GREATEST BORE HEEVER MET WITH. LADISLAW HAS ALMOST FORSAKEN THE HOUSE SINCE HE CAME.ROSAMOND THOUGHT SHE KNEW PERFECTLY WELL WHY MR. LADISLAW DISLIKED THECAPTAIN HE WAS JEALOUS AND SHE LIKED HIS BEING JEALOUS.IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WILL SUIT ECCENTRIC PERSONS SHEANSWERED BUT IN MY OPINION CAPTAIN LYDGATE IS A THOROUGH GENTLEMANAND I THINK YOU OUGHT NOT OUT OF RESPECT TO SIR GODWIN TO TREAT HIMWITH NEGLECT.NO DEAR BUT WE HAVE HAD DINNERS FOR HIM. AND HE COMES IN AND GOESOUT AS HE LIKES. HE DOESNT WANT ME.STILL WHEN HE IS IN THE ROOM YOU MIGHT SHOW HIM MORE ATTENTION. HEMAY NOT BE A PHOENIX OF CLEVERNESS IN YOUR SENSE HIS PROFESSION ISDIFFERENT BUT IT WOULD BE ALL THE BETTER FOR YOU TO TALK A LITTLE ONHIS SUBJECTS. I THINK HIS CONVERSATION IS QUITE AGREEABLE. AND HE ISANYTHING BUT AN UNPRINCIPLED MAN.THE FACT IS YOU WOULD WISH ME TO BE A LITTLE MORE LIKE HIM ROSYSAID LYDGATE IN A SORT OF RESIGNED MURMUR WITH A SMILE WHICH WAS NOTEXACTLY TENDER AND CERTAINLY NOT MERRY. ROSAMOND WAS SILENT AND DIDNOT SMILE AGAIN BUT THE LOVELY CURVES OF HER FACE LOOKED GOODTEMPEREDENOUGH WITHOUT SMILING.THOSE WORDS OF LYDGATES WERE LIKE A SAD MILESTONE MARKING HOW FAR HEHAD TRAVELLED FROM HIS OLD DREAMLAND IN WHICH ROSAMOND VINCY APPEAREDTO BE THAT PERFECT PIECE OF WOMANHOOD WHO WOULD REVERENCE HER HUSBANDSMIND AFTER THE FASHION OF AN ACCOMPLISHED MERMAID USING HER COMB ANDLOOKINGGLASS AND SINGING HER SONG FOR THE RELAXATION OF HIS ADOREDWISDOM ALONE. HE HAD BEGUN TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THAT IMAGINEDADORATION AND THE ATTRACTION TOWARDS A MANS TALENT BECAUSE IT GIVESHIM PRESTIGE AND IS LIKE AN ORDER IN HIS BUTTONHOLE OR AN HONORABLEBEFORE HIS NAME.IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED THAT ROSAMOND HAD TRAVELLED TOO SINCE SHEHAD FOUND THE POINTLESS CONVERSATION OF MR. NED PLYMDALE PERFECTLYWEARISOME BUT TO MOST MORTALS THERE IS A STUPIDITY WHICH ISUNENDURABLE AND A STUPIDITY WHICH IS ALTOGETHER ACCEPTABLEELSEINDEED WHAT WOULD BECOME OF SOCIAL BONDS CAPTAIN LYDGATES STUPIDITYWAS DELICATELY SCENTED CARRIED ITSELF WITH STYLE TALKED WITH A GOODACCENT AND WAS CLOSELY RELATED TO SIR GODWIN. ROSAMOND FOUND IT QUITEAGREEABLE AND CAUGHT MANY OF ITS PHRASES.THEREFORE SINCE ROSAMOND AS WE KNOW WAS FOND OF HORSEBACK THERE WEREPLENTY OF REASONS WHY SHE SHOULD BE TEMPTED TO RESUME HER RIDING WHENCAPTAIN LYDGATE WHO HAD ORDERED HIS MAN WITH TWO HORSES TO FOLLOW HIMAND PUT UP AT THE GREEN DRAGON BEGGED HER TO GO OUT ON THE GRAYWHICH HE WARRANTED TO BE GENTLE AND TRAINED TO CARRY A LADYINDEED HEHAD BOUGHT IT FOR HIS SISTER AND WAS TAKING IT TO QUALLINGHAM.ROSAMOND WENT OUT THE FIRST TIME WITHOUT TELLING HER HUSBAND AND CAMEBACK BEFORE HIS RETURN BUT THE RIDE HAD BEEN SO THOROUGH A SUCCESSAND SHE DECLARED HERSELF SO MUCH THE BETTER IN CONSEQUENCE THAT HE WASINFORMED OF IT WITH FULL RELIANCE ON HIS CONSENT THAT SHE SHOULD GORIDING AGAIN.ON THE CONTRARY LYDGATE WAS MORE THAN HURTHE WAS UTTERLY CONFOUNDEDTHAT SHE HAD RISKED HERSELF ON A STRANGE HORSE WITHOUT REFERRING THEMATTER TO HIS WISH. AFTER THE FIRST ALMOST THUNDERING EXCLAMATIONS OFASTONISHMENT WHICH SUFFICIENTLY WARNED ROSAMOND OF WHAT WAS COMING HEWAS SILENT FOR SOME MOMENTS.HOWEVER YOU HAVE COME BACK SAFELY HE SAID AT LAST IN A DECISIVETONE. YOU WILL NOT GO AGAIN ROSY THAT IS UNDERSTOOD. IF IT WERE THEQUIETEST MOST FAMILIAR HORSE IN THE WORLD THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE THECHANCE OF ACCIDENT. AND YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT I WISHED YOU TO GIVE UPRIDING THE ROAN ON THAT ACCOUNT.BUT THERE IS THE CHANCE OF ACCIDENT INDOORS TERTIUS.MY DARLING DONT TALK NONSENSE SAID LYDGATE IN AN IMPLORING TONESURELY I AM THE PERSON TO JUDGE FOR YOU. I THINK IT IS ENOUGH THAT ISAY YOU ARE NOT TO GO AGAIN.ROSAMOND WAS ARRANGING HER HAIR BEFORE DINNER AND THE REFLECTION OFHER HEAD IN THE GLASS SHOWED NO CHANGE IN ITS LOVELINESS EXCEPT ALITTLE TURNING ASIDE OF THE LONG NECK. LYDGATE HAD BEEN MOVING ABOUTWITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND NOW PAUSED NEAR HER AS IF HEAWAITED SOME ASSURANCE.I WISH YOU WOULD FASTEN UP MY PLAITS DEAR SAID ROSAMOND LETTINGHER ARMS FALL WITH A LITTLE SIGH SO AS TO MAKE A HUSBAND ASHAMED OFSTANDING THERE LIKE A BRUTE. LYDGATE HAD OFTEN FASTENED THE PLAITSBEFORE BEING AMONG THE DEFTEST OF MEN WITH HIS LARGE FINELY FORMEDFINGERS. HE SWEPT UP THE SOFT FESTOONS OF PLAITS AND FASTENED IN THETALL COMB TO SUCH USES DO MEN COME AND WHAT COULD HE DO THEN BUTKISS THE EXQUISITE NAPE WHICH WAS SHOWN IN ALL ITS DELICATE CURVES BUTWHEN WE DO WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE IT IS OFTEN WITH A DIFFERENCE.LYDGATE WAS STILL ANGRY AND HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HIS POINT.I SHALL TELL THE CAPTAIN THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN OFFERYOU HIS HORSE HE SAID AS HE MOVED AWAY.I BEG YOU WILL NOT DO ANYTHING OF THE KIND TERTIUS SAID ROSAMONDLOOKING AT HIM WITH SOMETHING MORE MARKED THAN USUAL IN HER SPEECH. ITWILL BE TREATING ME AS IF I WERE A CHILD. PROMISE THAT YOU WILL LEAVETHE SUBJECT TO ME.THERE DID SEEM TO BE SOME TRUTH IN HER OBJECTION. LYDGATE SAID VERYWELL WITH A SURLY OBEDIENCE AND THUS THE DISCUSSION ENDED WITH HISPROMISING ROSAMOND AND NOT WITH HER PROMISING HIM.IN FACT SHE HAD BEEN DETERMINED NOT TO PROMISE. ROSAMOND HAD THATVICTORIOUS OBSTINACY WHICH NEVER WASTES ITS ENERGY IN IMPETUOUSRESISTANCE. WHAT SHE LIKED TO DO WAS TO HER THE RIGHT THING AND ALLHER CLEVERNESS WAS DIRECTED TO GETTING THE MEANS OF DOING IT. SHE MEANTTO GO OUT RIDING AGAIN ON THE GRAY AND SHE DID GO ON THE NEXTOPPORTUNITY OF HER HUSBANDS ABSENCE NOT INTENDING THAT HE SHOULD KNOWUNTIL IT WAS LATE ENOUGH NOT TO SIGNIFY TO HER. THE TEMPTATION WASCERTAINLY GREAT SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE EXERCISE AND THEGRATIFICATION OF RIDING ON A FINE HORSE WITH CAPTAIN LYDGATE SIRGODWINS SON ON ANOTHER FINE HORSE BY HER SIDE AND OF BEING MET INTHIS POSITION BY ANY ONE BUT HER HUSBAND WAS SOMETHING AS GOOD AS HERDREAMS BEFORE MARRIAGE MOREOVER SHE WAS RIVETING THE CONNECTION WITHTHE FAMILY AT QUALLINGHAM WHICH MUST BE A WISE THING TO DO.BUT THE GENTLE GRAY UNPREPARED FOR THE CRASH OF A TREE THAT WAS BEINGFELLED ON THE EDGE OF HALSELL WOOD TOOK FRIGHT AND CAUSED A WORSEFRIGHT TO ROSAMOND LEADING FINALLY TO THE LOSS OF HER BABY. LYDGATECOULD NOT SHOW HIS ANGER TOWARDS HER BUT HE WAS RATHER BEARISH TO THECAPTAIN WHOSE VISIT NATURALLY SOON CAME TO AN END.IN ALL FUTURE CONVERSATIONS ON THE SUBJECT ROSAMOND WAS MILDLY CERTAINTHAT THE RIDE HAD MADE NO DIFFERENCE AND THAT IF SHE HAD STAYED ATHOME THE SAME SYMPTOMS WOULD HAVE COME ON AND WOULD HAVE ENDED IN THESAME WAY BECAUSE SHE HAD FELT SOMETHING LIKE THEM BEFORE.LYDGATE COULD ONLY SAY POOR POOR DARLINGBUT HE SECRETLY WONDEREDOVER THE TERRIBLE TENACITY OF THIS MILD CREATURE. THERE WAS GATHERINGWITHIN HIM AN AMAZED SENSE OF HIS POWERLESSNESS OVER ROSAMOND. HISSUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE AND MENTAL FORCE INSTEAD OF BEING AS HE HADIMAGINED A SHRINE TO CONSULT ON ALL OCCASIONS WAS SIMPLY SET ASIDE ONEVERY PRACTICAL QUESTION. HE HAD REGARDED ROSAMONDS CLEVERNESS ASPRECISELY OF THE RECEPTIVE KIND WHICH BECAME A WOMAN. HE WAS NOWBEGINNING TO FIND OUT WHAT THAT CLEVERNESS WASWHAT WAS THE SHAPE INTOWHICH IT HAD RUN AS INTO A CLOSE NETWORK ALOOF AND INDEPENDENT. NO ONEQUICKER THAN ROSAMOND TO SEE CAUSES AND EFFECTS WHICH LAY WITHIN THETRACK OF HER OWN TASTES AND INTERESTS SHE HAD SEEN CLEARLY LYDGATESPREEMINENCE IN MIDDLEMARCH SOCIETY AND COULD GO ON IMAGINATIVELYTRACING STILL MORE AGREEABLE SOCIAL EFFECTS WHEN HIS TALENT SHOULD HAVEADVANCED HIM BUT FOR HER HIS PROFESSIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC AMBITION HADNO OTHER RELATION TO THESE DESIRABLE EFFECTS THAN IF THEY HAD BEEN THEFORTUNATE DISCOVERY OF AN ILLSMELLING OIL. AND THAT OIL APART WITHWHICH SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO OF COURSE SHE BELIEVED IN HER OWN OPINIONMORE THAN SHE DID IN HIS. LYDGATE WAS ASTOUNDED TO FIND IN NUMBERLESSTRIFLING MATTERS AS WELL AS IN THIS LAST SERIOUS CASE OF THE RIDINGTHAT AFFECTION DID NOT MAKE HER COMPLIANT. HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT THEAFFECTION WAS THERE AND HAD NO PRESENTIMENT THAT HE HAD DONE ANYTHINGTO REPEL IT. FOR HIS OWN PART HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE LOVED HER ASTENDERLY AS EVER AND COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND TO HER NEGATIONSBUTWELL LYDGATE WAS MUCH WORRIED AND CONSCIOUS OF NEW ELEMENTS INHIS LIFE AS NOXIOUS TO HIM AS AN INLET OF MUD TO A CREATURE THAT HASBEEN USED TO BREATHE AND BATHE AND DART AFTER ITS ILLUMINATED PREY INTHE CLEAREST OF WATERS.ROSAMOND WAS SOON LOOKING LOVELIER THAN EVER AT HER WORKTABLE ENJOYINGDRIVES IN HER FATHERS PHAETON AND THINKING IT LIKELY THAT SHE MIGHT BEINVITED TO QUALLINGHAM. SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS A MUCH MORE EXQUISITEORNAMENT TO THE DRAWINGROOM THERE THAN ANY DAUGHTER OF THE FAMILY ANDIN REFLECTING THAT THE GENTLEMEN WERE AWARE OF THAT DID NOT PERHAPSSUFFICIENTLY CONSIDER WHETHER THE LADIES WOULD BE EAGER TO SEETHEMSELVES SURPASSED.LYDGATE RELIEVED FROM ANXIETY ABOUT HER RELAPSED INTO WHAT SHEINWARDLY CALLED HIS MOODINESSA NAME WHICH TO HER COVERED HISTHOUGHTFUL PREOCCUPATION WITH OTHER SUBJECTS THAN HERSELF AS WELL ASTHAT UNEASY LOOK OF THE BROW AND DISTASTE FOR ALL ORDINARY THINGS AS IFTHEY WERE MIXED WITH BITTER HERBS WHICH REALLY MADE A SORT OFWEATHERGLASS TO HIS VEXATION AND FOREBODING. THESE LATTER STATES OFMIND HAD ONE CAUSE AMONGST OTHERS WHICH HE HAD GENEROUSLY BUTMISTAKENLY AVOIDED MENTIONING TO ROSAMOND LEST IT SHOULD AFFECT HERHEALTH AND SPIRITS. BETWEEN HIM AND HER INDEED THERE WAS THAT TOTALMISSING OF EACH OTHERS MENTAL TRACK WHICH IS TOO EVIDENTLY POSSIBLEEVEN BETWEEN PERSONS WHO ARE CONTINUALLY THINKING OF EACH OTHER. TOLYDGATE IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD BEEN SPENDING MONTH AFTER MONTH INSACRIFICING MORE THAN HALF OF HIS BEST INTENT AND BEST POWER TO HISTENDERNESS FOR ROSAMOND BEARING HER LITTLE CLAIMS AND INTERRUPTIONSWITHOUT IMPATIENCE AND ABOVE ALL BEARING WITHOUT BETRAYAL OFBITTERNESS TO LOOK THROUGH LESS AND LESS OF INTERFERING ILLUSION AT THEBLANK UNREFLECTING SURFACE HER MIND PRESENTED TO HIS ARDOR FOR THE MOREIMPERSONAL ENDS OF HIS PROFESSION AND HIS SCIENTIFIC STUDY AN ARDORWHICH HE HAD FANCIED THAT THE IDEAL WIFE MUST SOMEHOW WORSHIP ASSUBLIME THOUGH NOT IN THE LEAST KNOWING WHY. BUT HIS ENDURANCE WASMINGLED WITH A SELFDISCONTENT WHICH IF WE KNOW HOW TO BE CANDID WESHALL CONFESS TO MAKE MORE THAN HALF OUR BITTERNESS UNDER GRIEVANCESWIFE OR HUSBAND INCLUDED. IT ALWAYS REMAINS TRUE THAT IF WE HAD BEENGREATER CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS STRONG AGAINST US. LYDGATEWAS AWARE THAT HIS CONCESSIONS TO ROSAMOND WERE OFTEN LITTLE MORE THANTHE LAPSE OF SLACKENING RESOLUTION THE CREEPING PARALYSIS APT TO SEIZEAN ENTHUSIASM WHICH IS OUT OF ADJUSTMENT TO A CONSTANT PORTION OF OURLIVES. AND ON LYDGATES ENTHUSIASM THERE WAS CONSTANTLY PRESSING NOT ASIMPLE WEIGHT OF SORROW BUT THE BITING PRESENCE OF A PETTY DEGRADINGCARE SUCH AS CASTS THE BLIGHT OF IRONY OVER ALL HIGHER EFFORT.THIS WAS THE CARE WHICH HE HAD HITHERTO ABSTAINED FROM MENTIONING TOROSAMOND AND HE BELIEVED WITH SOME WONDER THAT IT HAD NEVER ENTEREDHER MIND THOUGH CERTAINLY NO DIFFICULTY COULD BE LESS MYSTERIOUS. ITWAS AN INFERENCE WITH A CONSPICUOUS HANDLE TO IT AND HAD BEEN EASILYDRAWN BY INDIFFERENT OBSERVERS THAT LYDGATE WAS IN DEBT AND HE COULDNOT SUCCEED IN KEEPING OUT OF HIS MIND FOR LONG TOGETHER THAT HE WASEVERY DAY GETTING DEEPER INTO THAT SWAMP WHICH TEMPTS MEN TOWARDS ITWITH SUCH A PRETTY COVERING OF FLOWERS AND VERDURE. IT IS WONDERFUL HOWSOON A MAN GETS UP TO HIS CHIN THEREIN A CONDITION IN WHICH IN SPITEOF HIMSELF HE IS FORCED TO THINK CHIEFLY OF RELEASE THOUGH HE HAD ASCHEME OF THE UNIVERSE IN HIS SOUL.EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO LYDGATE WAS POOR BUT HAD NEVER KNOWN THE EAGERWANT OF SMALL SUMS AND FELT RATHER A BURNING CONTEMPT FOR ANY ONE WHODESCENDED A STEP IN ORDER TO GAIN THEM. HE WAS NOW EXPERIENCINGSOMETHING WORSE THAN A SIMPLE DEFICIT HE WAS ASSAILED BY THE VULGARHATEFUL TRIALS OF A MAN WHO HAS BOUGHT AND USED A GREAT MANY THINGSWHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE WITHOUT AND WHICH HE IS UNABLE TO PAY FORTHOUGH THE DEMAND FOR PAYMENT HAS BECOME PRESSING.HOW THIS CAME ABOUT MAY BE EASILY SEEN WITHOUT MUCH ARITHMETIC ORKNOWLEDGE OF PRICES. WHEN A MAN IN SETTING UP A HOUSE AND PREPARING FORMARRIAGE FINDS THAT HIS FURNITURE AND OTHER INITIAL EXPENSES COME TOBETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS MORE THAN HE HAS CAPITAL TO PAYFOR WHEN AT THE END OF A YEAR IT APPEARS THAT HIS HOUSEHOLD EXPENSESHORSES AND ET CAETERAS AMOUNT TO NEARLY A THOUSAND WHILE THE PROCEEDSOF THE PRACTICE RECKONED FROM THE OLD BOOKS TO BE WORTH EIGHT HUNDREDPER ANNUM HAVE SUNK LIKE A SUMMER POND AND MAKE HARDLY FIVE HUNDREDCHIEFLY IN UNPAID ENTRIES THE PLAIN INFERENCE IS THAT WHETHER HEMINDS IT OR NOT HE IS IN DEBT. THOSE WERE LESS EXPENSIVE TIMES THANOUR OWN AND PROVINCIAL LIFE WAS COMPARATIVELY MODEST BUT THE EASEWITH WHICH A MEDICAL MAN WHO HAD LATELY BOUGHT A PRACTICE WHO THOUGHTTHAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO KEEP TWO HORSES WHOSE TABLE WAS SUPPLIEDWITHOUT STINT AND WHO PAID AN INSURANCE ON HIS LIFE AND A HIGH RENTFOR HOUSE AND GARDEN MIGHT FIND HIS EXPENSES DOUBLING HIS RECEIPTSCAN BE CONCEIVED BY ANY ONE WHO DOES NOT THINK THESE DETAILS BENEATHHIS CONSIDERATION. ROSAMOND ACCUSTOMED FROM HER CHILDHOOD TO ANEXTRAVAGANT HOUSEHOLD THOUGHT THAT GOOD HOUSEKEEPING CONSISTED SIMPLYIN ORDERING THE BEST OF EVERYTHINGNOTHING ELSE ANSWERED AND LYDGATESUPPOSED THAT IF THINGS WERE DONE AT ALL THEY MUST BE DONEPROPERLYHE DID NOT SEE HOW THEY WERE TO LIVE OTHERWISE. IF EACH HEADOF HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURE HAD BEEN MENTIONED TO HIM BEFOREHAND HE WOULDHAVE PROBABLY OBSERVED THAT IT COULD HARDLY COME TO MUCH AND IF ANYONE HAD SUGGESTED A SAVING ON A PARTICULAR ARTICLEFOR EXAMPLE THESUBSTITUTION OF CHEAP FISH FOR DEARIT WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO HIMSIMPLY A PENNYWISE MEAN NOTION. ROSAMOND EVEN WITHOUT SUCH ANOCCASION AS CAPTAIN LYDGATES VISIT WAS FOND OF GIVING INVITATIONSAND LYDGATE THOUGH HE OFTEN THOUGHT THE GUESTS TIRESOME DID NOTINTERFERE. THIS SOCIABILITY SEEMED A NECESSARY PART OF PROFESSIONALPRUDENCE AND THE ENTERTAINMENT MUST BE SUITABLE. IT IS TRUE LYDGATEWAS CONSTANTLY VISITING THE HOMES OF THE POOR AND ADJUSTING HISPRESCRIPTIONS OF DIET TO THEIR SMALL MEANS BUT DEAR ME HAS IT NOT BYTHIS TIME CEASED TO BE REMARKABLEIS IT NOT RATHER THAT WE EXPECT INMEN THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE NUMEROUS STRANDS OF EXPERIENCE LYING SIDE BYSIDE AND NEVER COMPARE THEM WITH EACH OTHER EXPENDITURELIKE UGLINESSAND ERRORSBECOMES A TOTALLY NEW THING WHEN WE ATTACH OUR OWNPERSONALITY TO IT AND MEASURE IT BY THAT WIDE DIFFERENCE WHICH ISMANIFEST IN OUR OWN SENSATIONS BETWEEN OURSELVES AND OTHERS. LYDGATEBELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE CARELESS ABOUT HIS DRESS AND HE DESPISED A MANWHO CALCULATED THE EFFECTS OF HIS COSTUME IT SEEMED TO HIM ONLY AMATTER OF COURSE THAT HE HAD ABUNDANCE OF FRESH GARMENTSSUCH THINGSWERE NATURALLY ORDERED IN SHEAVES. IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT HE HADNEVER HITHERTO FELT THE CHECK OF IMPORTUNATE DEBT AND HE WALKED BYHABIT NOT BY SELFCRITICISM. BUT THE CHECK HAD COME.ITS NOVELTY MADE IT THE MORE IRRITATING. HE WAS AMAZED DISGUSTED THATCONDITIONS SO FOREIGN TO ALL HIS PURPOSES SO HATEFULLY DISCONNECTEDWITH THE OBJECTS HE CARED TO OCCUPY HIMSELF WITH SHOULD HAVE LAIN INAMBUSH AND CLUTCHED HIM WHEN HE WAS UNAWARE. AND THERE WAS NOT ONLY THEACTUAL DEBT THERE WAS THE CERTAINTY THAT IN HIS PRESENT POSITION HEMUST GO ON DEEPENING IT. TWO FURNISHING TRADESMEN AT BRASSING WHOSEBILLS HAD BEEN INCURRED BEFORE HIS MARRIAGE AND WHOM UNCALCULATEDCURRENT EXPENSES HAD EVER SINCE PREVENTED HIM FROM PAYING HADREPEATEDLY SENT HIM UNPLEASANT LETTERS WHICH HAD FORCED THEMSELVES ONHIS ATTENTION. THIS COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN MORE GALLING TO ANYDISPOSITION THAN TO LYDGATES WITH HIS INTENSE PRIDEHIS DISLIKE OFASKING A FAVOR OR BEING UNDER AN OBLIGATION TO ANY ONE. HE HAD SCORNEDEVEN TO FORM CONJECTURES ABOUT MR. VINCYS INTENTIONS ON MONEY MATTERSAND NOTHING BUT EXTREMITY COULD HAVE INDUCED HIM TO APPLY TO HISFATHERINLAW EVEN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN MADE AWARE IN VARIOUS INDIRECTWAYS SINCE HIS MARRIAGE THAT MR. VINCYS OWN AFFAIRS WERE NOTFLOURISHING AND THAT THE EXPECTATION OF HELP FROM HIM WOULD BERESENTED. SOME MEN EASILY TRUST IN THE READINESS OF FRIENDS IT HADNEVER IN THE FORMER PART OF HIS LIFE OCCURRED TO LYDGATE THAT HE SHOULDNEED TO DO SO HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT WHAT BORROWING WOULD BE TO HIM BUTNOW THAT THE IDEA HAD ENTERED HIS MIND HE FELT THAT HE WOULD RATHERINCUR ANY OTHER HARDSHIP. IN THE MEAN TIME HE HAD NO MONEY OR PROSPECTSOF MONEY AND HIS PRACTICE WAS NOT GETTING MORE LUCRATIVE.NO WONDER THAT LYDGATE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO SUPPRESS ALL SIGNS OF INWARDTROUBLE DURING THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND NOW THAT ROSAMOND WAS REGAININGBRILLIANT HEALTH HE MEDITATED TAKING HER ENTIRELY INTO CONFIDENCE ONHIS DIFFICULTIES. NEW CONVERSANCE WITH TRADESMENS BILLS HAD FORCED HISREASONING INTO A NEW CHANNEL OF COMPARISON HE HAD BEGUN TO CONSIDERFROM A NEW POINT OF VIEW WHAT WAS NECESSARY AND UNNECESSARY IN GOODSORDERED AND TO SEE THAT THERE MUST BE SOME CHANGE OF HABITS. HOW COULDSUCH A CHANGE BE MADE WITHOUT ROSAMONDS CONCURRENCE THE IMMEDIATEOCCASION OF OPENING THE DISAGREEABLE FACT TO HER WAS FORCED UPON HIM.HAVING NO MONEY AND HAVING PRIVATELY SOUGHT ADVICE AS TO WHAT SECURITYCOULD POSSIBLY BE GIVEN BY A MAN IN HIS POSITION LYDGATE HAD OFFEREDTHE ONE GOOD SECURITY IN HIS POWER TO THE LESS PEREMPTORY CREDITOR WHOWAS A SILVERSMITH AND JEWELLER AND WHO CONSENTED TO TAKE ON HIMSELFTHE UPHOLSTERERS CREDIT ALSO ACCEPTING INTEREST FOR A GIVEN TERM. THESECURITY NECESSARY WAS A BILL OF SALE ON THE FURNITURE OF HIS HOUSEWHICH MIGHT MAKE A CREDITOR EASY FOR A REASONABLE TIME ABOUT A DEBTAMOUNTING TO LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS AND THE SILVERSMITH MR.DOVER WAS WILLING TO REDUCE IT BY TAKING BACK A PORTION OF THE PLATEAND ANY OTHER ARTICLE WHICH WAS AS GOOD AS NEW. ANY OTHER ARTICLE WASA PHRASE DELICATELY IMPLYING JEWELLERY AND MORE PARTICULARLY SOMEPURPLE AMETHYSTS COSTING THIRTY POUNDS WHICH LYDGATE HAD BOUGHT AS ABRIDAL PRESENT.OPINIONS MAY BE DIVIDED AS TO HIS WISDOM IN MAKING THIS PRESENT SOMEMAY THINK THAT IT WAS A GRACEFUL ATTENTION TO BE EXPECTED FROM A MANLIKE LYDGATE AND THAT THE FAULT OF ANY TROUBLESOME CONSEQUENCES LAY INTHE PINCHED NARROWNESS OF PROVINCIAL LIFE AT THAT TIME WHICH OFFEREDNO CONVENIENCES FOR PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE WHOSE FORTUNE WAS NOTPROPORTIONED TO THEIR TASTES ALSO IN LYDGATES RIDICULOUSFASTIDIOUSNESS ABOUT ASKING HIS FRIENDS FOR MONEY.HOWEVER IT HAD SEEMED A QUESTION OF NO MOMENT TO HIM ON THAT FINEMORNING WHEN HE WENT TO GIVE A FINAL ORDER FOR PLATE IN THE PRESENCEOF OTHER JEWELS ENORMOUSLY EXPENSIVE AND AS AN ADDITION TO ORDERS OFWHICH THE AMOUNT HAD NOT BEEN EXACTLY CALCULATED THIRTY POUNDS FORORNAMENTS SO EXQUISITELY SUITED TO ROSAMONDS NECK AND ARMS COULDHARDLY APPEAR EXCESSIVE WHEN THERE WAS NO READY CASH FOR IT TO EXCEED.BUT AT THIS CRISIS LYDGATES IMAGINATION COULD NOT HELP DWELLING ON THEPOSSIBILITY OF LETTING THE AMETHYSTS TAKE THEIR PLACE AGAIN AMONG MR.DOVERS STOCK THOUGH HE SHRANK FROM THE IDEA OF PROPOSING THIS TOROSAMOND. HAVING BEEN ROUSED TO DISCERN CONSEQUENCES WHICH HE HAD NEVERBEEN IN THE HABIT OF TRACING HE WAS PREPARING TO ACT ON THISDISCERNMENT WITH SOME OF THE RIGOR BY NO MEANS ALL THAT HE WOULD HAVEAPPLIED IN PURSUING EXPERIMENT. HE WAS NERVING HIMSELF TO THIS RIGOR ASHE RODE FROM BRASSING AND MEDITATED ON THE REPRESENTATIONS HE MUSTMAKE TO ROSAMOND.IT WAS EVENING WHEN HE GOT HOME. HE WAS INTENSELY MISERABLE THISSTRONG MAN OF NINEANDTWENTY AND OF MANY GIFTS. HE WAS NOT SAYINGANGRILY WITHIN HIMSELF THAT HE HAD MADE A PROFOUND MISTAKE BUT THEMISTAKE WAS AT WORK IN HIM LIKE A RECOGNIZED CHRONIC DISEASE MINGLINGITS UNEASY IMPORTUNITIES WITH EVERY PROSPECT AND ENFEEBLING EVERYTHOUGHT. AS HE WENT ALONG THE PASSAGE TO THE DRAWINGROOM HE HEARD THEPIANO AND SINGING. OF COURSE LADISLAW WAS THERE. IT WAS SOME WEEKSSINCE WILL HAD PARTED FROM DOROTHEA YET HE WAS STILL AT THE OLD POSTIN MIDDLEMARCH. LYDGATE HAD NO OBJECTION IN GENERAL TO LADISLAWSCOMING BUT JUST NOW HE WAS ANNOYED THAT HE COULD NOT FIND HIS HEARTHFREE. WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR THE TWO SINGERS WENT ON TOWARDS THEKEYNOTE RAISING THEIR EYES AND LOOKING AT HIM INDEED BUT NOTREGARDING HIS ENTRANCE AS AN INTERRUPTION. TO A MAN GALLED WITH HISHARNESS AS POOR LYDGATE WAS IT IS NOT SOOTHING TO SEE TWO PEOPLEWARBLING AT HIM AS HE COMES IN WITH THE SENSE THAT THE PAINFUL DAY HASSTILL PAINS IN STORE. HIS FACE ALREADY PALER THAN USUAL TOOK ON ASCOWL AS HE WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM AND FLUNG HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR.THE SINGERS FEELING THEMSELVES EXCUSED BY THE FACT THAT THEY HAD ONLYTHREE BARS TO SING NOW TURNED ROUND.HOW ARE YOU LYDGATE SAID WILL COMING FORWARD TO SHAKE HANDS.LYDGATE TOOK HIS HAND BUT DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO SPEAK.HAVE YOU DINED TERTIUS I EXPECTED YOU MUCH EARLIER SAID ROSAMONDWHO HAD ALREADY SEEN THAT HER HUSBAND WAS IN A HORRIBLE HUMOR. SHESEATED HERSELF IN HER USUAL PLACE AS SHE SPOKE.I HAVE DINED. I SHOULD LIKE SOME TEA PLEASE SAID LYDGATE CURTLYSTILL SCOWLING AND LOOKING MARKEDLY AT HIS LEGS STRETCHED OUT BEFOREHIM.WILL WAS TOO QUICK TO NEED MORE. I SHALL BE OFF HE SAID REACHINGHIS HAT.TEA IS COMING SAID ROSAMOND PRAY DONT GO.YES LYDGATE IS BORED SAID WILL WHO HAD MORE COMPREHENSION OFLYDGATE THAN ROSAMOND HAD AND WAS NOT OFFENDED BY HIS MANNER EASILYIMAGINING OUTDOOR CAUSES OF ANNOYANCE.THERE IS THE MORE NEED FOR YOU TO STAY SAID ROSAMOND PLAYFULLY ANDIN HER LIGHTEST ACCENT HE WILL NOT SPEAK TO ME ALL THE EVENING.YES ROSAMOND I SHALL SAID LYDGATE IN HIS STRONG BARITONE. I HAVESOME SERIOUS BUSINESS TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT.NO INTRODUCTION OF THE BUSINESS COULD HAVE BEEN LESS LIKE THAT WHICHLYDGATE HAD INTENDED BUT HER INDIFFERENT MANNER HAD BEEN TOOPROVOKING.THERE YOU SEE SAID WILL. IM GOING TO THE MEETING ABOUT THEMECHANICS INSTITUTE. GOODBY AND HE WENT QUICKLY OUT OF THE ROOM.ROSAMOND DID NOT LOOK AT HER HUSBAND BUT PRESENTLY ROSE AND TOOK HERPLACE BEFORE THE TEATRAY. SHE WAS THINKING THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIMSO DISAGREEABLE. LYDGATE TURNED HIS DARK EYES ON HER AND WATCHED HER ASSHE DELICATELY HANDLED THE TEASERVICE WITH HER TAPER FINGERS ANDLOOKED AT THE OBJECTS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE HER WITH NO CURVE IN HER FACEDISTURBED AND YET WITH AN INEFFABLE PROTEST IN HER AIR AGAINST ALLPEOPLE WITH UNPLEASANT MANNERS. FOR THE MOMENT HE LOST THE SENSE OF HISWOUND IN A SUDDEN SPECULATION ABOUT THIS NEW FORM OF FEMININEIMPASSIBILITY REVEALING ITSELF IN THE SYLPHLIKE FRAME WHICH HE HADONCE INTERPRETED AS THE SIGN OF A READY INTELLIGENT SENSITIVENESS. HISMIND GLANCING BACK TO LAURE WHILE HE LOOKED AT ROSAMOND HE SAIDINWARDLY WOULD SHE KILL ME BECAUSE I WEARIED HER AND THEN IT ISTHE WAY WITH ALL WOMEN. BUT THIS POWER OF GENERALIZING WHICH GIVES MENSO MUCH THE SUPERIORITY IN MISTAKE OVER THE DUMB ANIMALS WASIMMEDIATELY THWARTED BY LYDGATES MEMORY OF WONDERING IMPRESSIONS FROMTHE BEHAVIOR OF ANOTHER WOMANFROM DOROTHEAS LOOKS AND TONES OFEMOTION ABOUT HER HUSBAND WHEN LYDGATE BEGAN TO ATTEND HIMFROM HERPASSIONATE CRY TO BE TAUGHT WHAT WOULD BEST COMFORT THAT MAN FOR WHOSESAKE IT SEEMED AS IF SHE MUST QUELL EVERY IMPULSE IN HER EXCEPT THEYEARNINGS OF FAITHFULNESS AND COMPASSION. THESE REVIVED IMPRESSIONSSUCCEEDED EACH OTHER QUICKLY AND DREAMILY IN LYDGATES MIND WHILE THETEA WAS BEING BREWED. HE HAD SHUT HIS EYES IN THE LAST INSTANT OFREVERIE WHILE HE HEARD DOROTHEA SAYING ADVISE METHINK WHAT I CANDOHE HAS BEEN ALL HIS LIFE LABORING AND LOOKING FORWARD. HE MINDSABOUT NOTHING ELSEAND I MIND ABOUT NOTHING ELSE.THAT VOICE OF DEEPSOULED WOMANHOOD HAD REMAINED WITHIN HIM AS THEENKINDLING CONCEPTIONS OF DEAD AND SCEPTRED GENIUS HAD REMAINED WITHINHIM IS THERE NOT A GENIUS FOR FEELING NOBLY WHICH ALSO REIGNS OVERHUMAN SPIRITS AND THEIR CONCLUSIONS THE TONES WERE A MUSIC FROMWHICH HE WAS FALLING AWAYHE HAD REALLY FALLEN INTO A MOMENTARY DOZEWHEN ROSAMOND SAID IN HER SILVERY NEUTRAL WAY HERE IS YOUR TEATERTIUS SETTING IT ON THE SMALL TABLE BY HIS SIDE AND THEN MOVEDBACK TO HER PLACE WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIM. LYDGATE WAS TOO HASTY INATTRIBUTING INSENSIBILITY TO HER AFTER HER OWN FASHION SHE WASSENSITIVE ENOUGH AND TOOK LASTING IMPRESSIONS. HER IMPRESSION NOW WASONE OF OFFENCE AND REPULSION. BUT THEN ROSAMOND HAD NO SCOWLS AND HADNEVER RAISED HER VOICE SHE WAS QUITE SURE THAT NO ONE COULD JUSTLYFIND FAULT WITH HER.PERHAPS LYDGATE AND SHE HAD NEVER FELT SO FAR OFF EACH OTHER BEFOREBUT THERE WERE STRONG REASONS FOR NOT DEFERRING HIS REVELATION EVEN IFHE HAD NOT ALREADY BEGUN IT BY THAT ABRUPT ANNOUNCEMENT INDEED SOME OFTHE ANGRY DESIRE TO ROUSE HER INTO MORE SENSIBILITY ON HIS ACCOUNTWHICH HAD PROMPTED HIM TO SPEAK PREMATURELY STILL MINGLED WITH HISPAIN IN THE PROSPECT OF HER PAIN. BUT HE WAITED TILL THE TRAY WAS GONETHE CANDLES WERE LIT AND THE EVENING QUIET MIGHT BE COUNTED ON THEINTERVAL HAD LEFT TIME FOR REPELLED TENDERNESS TO RETURN INTO THE OLDCOURSE. HE SPOKE KINDLY.DEAR ROSY LAY DOWN YOUR WORK AND COME TO SIT BY ME HE SAID GENTLYPUSHING AWAY THE TABLE AND STRETCHING OUT HIS ARM TO DRAW A CHAIR NEARHIS OWN.ROSAMOND OBEYED. AS SHE CAME TOWARDS HIM IN HER DRAPERY OF TRANSPARENTFAINTLY TINTED MUSLIN HER SLIM YET ROUND FIGURE NEVER LOOKED MOREGRACEFUL AS SHE SAT DOWN BY HIM AND LAID ONE HAND ON THE ELBOW OF HISCHAIR AT LAST LOOKING AT HIM AND MEETING HIS EYES HER DELICATE NECKAND CHEEK AND PURELY CUT LIPS NEVER HAD MORE OF THAT UNTARNISHED BEAUTYWHICH TOUCHES AS IN SPRINGTIME AND INFANCY AND ALL SWEET FRESHNESS. ITTOUCHED LYDGATE NOW AND MINGLED THE EARLY MOMENTS OF HIS LOVE FOR HERWITH ALL THE OTHER MEMORIES WHICH WERE STIRRED IN THIS CRISIS OF DEEPTROUBLE. HE LAID HIS AMPLE HAND SOFTLY ON HERS SAYINGDEAR WITH THE LINGERING UTTERANCE WHICH AFFECTION GIVES TO THE WORD.ROSAMOND TOO WAS STILL UNDER THE POWER OF THAT SAME PAST AND HERHUSBAND WAS STILL IN PART THE LYDGATE WHOSE APPROVAL HAD STIRREDDELIGHT. SHE PUT HIS HAIR LIGHTLY AWAY FROM HIS FOREHEAD THEN LAID HEROTHER HAND ON HIS AND WAS CONSCIOUS OF FORGIVING HIM.I AM OBLIGED TO TELL YOU WHAT WILL HURT YOU ROSY. BUT THERE ARETHINGS WHICH HUSBAND AND WIFE MUST THINK OF TOGETHER. I DARE SAY IT HASOCCURRED TO YOU ALREADY THAT I AM SHORT OF MONEY.LYDGATE PAUSED BUT ROSAMOND TURNED HER NECK AND LOOKED AT A VASE ONTHE MANTELPIECE.I WAS NOT ABLE TO PAY FOR ALL THE THINGS WE HAD TO GET BEFORE WE WEREMARRIED AND THERE HAVE BEEN EXPENSES SINCE WHICH I HAVE BEEN OBLIGEDTO MEET. THE CONSEQUENCE IS THERE IS A LARGE DEBT AT BRASSINGTHREEHUNDRED AND EIGHTY POUNDSWHICH HAS BEEN PRESSING ON ME A GOOD WHILEAND IN FACT WE ARE GETTING DEEPER EVERY DAY FOR PEOPLE DONT PAY METHE FASTER BECAUSE OTHERS WANT THE MONEY. I TOOK PAINS TO KEEP IT FROMYOU WHILE YOU WERE NOT WELL BUT NOW WE MUST THINK TOGETHER ABOUT ITAND YOU MUST HELP ME.WHAT CAN I DO TERTIUS SAID ROSAMOND TURNING HER EYES ON HIMAGAIN. THAT LITTLE SPEECH OF FOUR WORDS LIKE SO MANY OTHERS IN ALLLANGUAGES IS CAPABLE BY VARIED VOCAL INFLECTIONS OF EXPRESSING ALLSTATES OF MIND FROM HELPLESS DIMNESS TO EXHAUSTIVE ARGUMENTATIVEPERCEPTION FROM THE COMPLETEST SELFDEVOTING FELLOWSHIP TO THE MOSTNEUTRAL ALOOFNESS. ROSAMONDS THIN UTTERANCE THREW INTO THE WORDS WHATCANIDO AS MUCH NEUTRALITY AS THEY COULD HOLD. THEY FELL LIKE AMORTAL CHILL ON LYDGATES ROUSED TENDERNESS. HE DID NOT STORM ININDIGNATIONHE FELT TOO SAD A SINKING OF THE HEART. AND WHEN HE SPOKEAGAIN IT WAS MORE IN THE TONE OF A MAN WHO FORCES HIMSELF TO FULFIL ATASK.IT IS NECESSARY FOR YOU TO KNOW BECAUSE I HAVE TO GIVE SECURITY FOR ATIME AND A MAN MUST COME TO MAKE AN INVENTORY OF THE FURNITURE.ROSAMOND COLORED DEEPLY. HAVE YOU NOT ASKED PAPA FOR MONEY SHE SAIDAS SOON AS SHE COULD SPEAK.NO.THEN I MUST ASK HIM SHE SAID RELEASING HER HANDS FROM LYDGATESAND RISING TO STAND AT TWO YARDS DISTANCE FROM HIM.NO ROSY SAID LYDGATE DECISIVELY. IT IS TOO LATE TO DO THAT. THEINVENTORY WILL BE BEGUN TOMORROW. REMEMBER IT IS A MERE SECURITY ITWILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IT IS A TEMPORARY AFFAIR. I INSIST UPON ITTHAT YOUR FATHER SHALL NOT KNOW UNLESS I CHOOSE TO TELL HIM ADDEDLYDGATE WITH A MORE PEREMPTORY EMPHASIS.THIS CERTAINLY WAS UNKIND BUT ROSAMOND HAD THROWN HIM BACK ON EVILEXPECTATION AS TO WHAT SHE WOULD DO IN THE WAY OF QUIET STEADYDISOBEDIENCE. THE UNKINDNESS SEEMED UNPARDONABLE TO HER SHE WAS NOTGIVEN TO WEEPING AND DISLIKED IT BUT NOW HER CHIN AND LIPS BEGAN TOTREMBLE AND THE TEARS WELLED UP. PERHAPS IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FORLYDGATE UNDER THE DOUBLE STRESS OF OUTWARD MATERIAL DIFFICULTY AND OFHIS OWN PROUD RESISTANCE TO HUMILIATING CONSEQUENCES TO IMAGINE FULLYWHAT THIS SUDDEN TRIAL WAS TO A YOUNG CREATURE WHO HAD KNOWN NOTHINGBUT INDULGENCE AND WHOSE DREAMS HAD ALL BEEN OF NEW INDULGENCE MOREEXACTLY TO HER TASTE. BUT HE DID WISH TO SPARE HER AS MUCH AS HE COULDAND HER TEARS CUT HIM TO THE HEART. HE COULD NOT SPEAK AGAINIMMEDIATELY BUT ROSAMOND DID NOT GO ON SOBBING SHE TRIED TO CONQUERHER AGITATION AND WIPED AWAY HER TEARS CONTINUING TO LOOK BEFORE HERAT THE MANTELPIECE.TRY NOT TO GRIEVE DARLING SAID LYDGATE TURNING HIS EYES UP TOWARDSHER. THAT SHE HAD CHOSEN TO MOVE AWAY FROM HIM IN THIS MOMENT OF HERTROUBLE MADE EVERYTHING HARDER TO SAY BUT HE MUST ABSOLUTELY GO ON.WE MUST BRACE OURSELVES TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY. IT IS I WHO HAVE BEENIN FAULT I OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN THAT I COULD NOT AFFORD TO LIVE IN THISWAY. BUT MANY THINGS HAVE TOLD AGAINST ME IN MY PRACTICE AND IT REALLYJUST NOW HAS EBBED TO A LOW POINT. I MAY RECOVER IT BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE MUST PULL UPWE MUST CHANGE OUR WAY OF LIVING. WE SHALL WEATHERIT. WHEN I HAVE GIVEN THIS SECURITY I SHALL HAVE TIME TO LOOK ABOUT MEAND YOU ARE SO CLEVER THAT IF YOU TURN YOUR MIND TO MANAGING YOU WILLSCHOOL ME INTO CAREFULNESS. I HAVE BEEN A THOUGHTLESS RASCAL ABOUTSQUARING PRICESBUT COME DEAR SIT DOWN AND FORGIVE ME.LYDGATE WAS BOWING HIS NECK UNDER THE YOKE LIKE A CREATURE WHO HADTALONS BUT WHO HAD REASON TOO WHICH OFTEN REDUCES US TO MEEKNESS.WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN THE LAST WORDS IN AN IMPLORING TONE ROSAMONDRETURNED TO THE CHAIR BY HIS SIDE. HIS SELFBLAME GAVE HER SOME HOPETHAT HE WOULD ATTEND TO HER OPINION AND SHE SAIDWHY CAN YOU NOT PUT OFF HAVING THE INVENTORY MADE YOU CAN SEND THEMEN AWAY TOMORROW WHEN THEY COME.I SHALL NOT SEND THEM AWAY SAID LYDGATE THE PEREMPTORINESS RISINGAGAIN. WAS IT OF ANY USE TO EXPLAINIF WE LEFT MIDDLEMARCH THERE WOULD OF COURSE BE A SALE AND THATWOULD DO AS WELL.BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LEAVE MIDDLEMARCH.I AM SURE TERTIUS IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER TO DO SO. WHY CAN WE NOTGO TO LONDON OR NEAR DURHAM WHERE YOUR FAMILY IS KNOWNWE CAN GO NOWHERE WITHOUT MONEY ROSAMOND.YOUR FRIENDS WOULD NOT WISH YOU TO BE WITHOUT MONEY. AND SURELY THESEODIOUS TRADESMEN MIGHT BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND TO WAIT IF YOUWOULD MAKE PROPER REPRESENTATIONS TO THEM.THIS IS IDLE ROSAMOND SAID LYDGATE ANGRILY. YOU MUST LEARN TO TAKEMY JUDGMENT ON QUESTIONS YOU DONT UNDERSTAND. I HAVE MADE NECESSARYARRANGEMENTS AND THEY MUST BE CARRIED OUT. AS TO FRIENDS I HAVE NOEXPECTATIONS WHATEVER FROM THEM AND SHALL NOT ASK THEM FOR ANYTHING.ROSAMOND SAT PERFECTLY STILL. THE THOUGHT IN HER MIND WAS THAT IF SHEHAD KNOWN HOW LYDGATE WOULD BEHAVE SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE MARRIED HIM.WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE NOW ON UNNECESSARY WORDS DEAR SAIDLYDGATE TRYING TO BE GENTLE AGAIN. THERE ARE SOME DETAILS THAT I WANTTO CONSIDER WITH YOU. DOVER SAYS HE WILL TAKE A GOOD DEAL OF THE PLATEBACK AGAIN AND ANY OF THE JEWELLERY WE LIKE. HE REALLY BEHAVES VERYWELL.ARE WE TO GO WITHOUT SPOONS AND FORKS THEN SAID ROSAMOND WHOSE VERYLIPS SEEMED TO GET THINNER WITH THE THINNESS OF HER UTTERANCE. SHE WASDETERMINED TO MAKE NO FURTHER RESISTANCE OR SUGGESTIONS.OH NO DEAR SAID LYDGATE. BUT LOOK HERE HE CONTINUED DRAWING APAPER FROM HIS POCKET AND OPENING IT HERE IS DOVERS ACCOUNT. SEE IHAVE MARKED A NUMBER OF ARTICLES WHICH IF WE RETURNED THEM WOULDREDUCE THE AMOUNT BY THIRTY POUNDS AND MORE. I HAVE NOT MARKED ANY OFTHE JEWELLERY. LYDGATE HAD REALLY FELT THIS POINT OF THE JEWELLERYVERY BITTER TO HIMSELF BUT HE HAD OVERCOME THE FEELING BY SEVEREARGUMENT. HE COULD NOT PROPOSE TO ROSAMOND THAT SHE SHOULD RETURN ANYPARTICULAR PRESENT OF HIS BUT HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE WAS BOUND TOPUT DOVERS OFFER BEFORE HER AND HER INWARD PROMPTING MIGHT MAKE THEAFFAIR EASY.IT IS USELESS FOR ME TO LOOK TERTIUS SAID ROSAMOND CALMLY YOUWILL RETURN WHAT YOU PLEASE. SHE WOULD NOT TURN HER EYES ON THE PAPERAND LYDGATE FLUSHING UP TO THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR DREW IT BACK AND LETIT FALL ON HIS KNEE. MEANWHILE ROSAMOND QUIETLY WENT OUT OF THE ROOMLEAVING LYDGATE HELPLESS AND WONDERING. WAS SHE NOT COMING BACK ITSEEMED THAT SHE HAD NO MORE IDENTIFIED HERSELF WITH HIM THAN IF THEYHAD BEEN CREATURES OF DIFFERENT SPECIES AND OPPOSING INTERESTS. HETOSSED HIS HEAD AND THRUST HIS HANDS DEEP INTO HIS POCKETS WITH A SORTOF VENGEANCE. THERE WAS STILL SCIENCETHERE WERE STILL GOOD OBJECTS TOWORK FOR. HE MUST GIVE A TUG STILLALL THE STRONGER BECAUSE OTHERSATISFACTIONS WERE GOING.BUT THE DOOR OPENED AND ROSAMOND REENTERED. SHE CARRIED THE LEATHERBOX CONTAINING THE AMETHYSTS AND A TINY ORNAMENTAL BASKET WHICHCONTAINED OTHER BOXES AND LAYING THEM ON THE CHAIR WHERE SHE HAD BEENSITTING SHE SAID WITH PERFECT PROPRIETY IN HER AIRTHIS IS ALL THE JEWELLERY YOU EVER GAVE ME. YOU CAN RETURN WHAT YOULIKE OF IT AND OF THE PLATE ALSO. YOU WILL NOT OF COURSE EXPECT METO STAY AT HOME TOMORROW. I SHALL GO TO PAPAS.TO MANY WOMEN THE LOOK LYDGATE CAST AT HER WOULD HAVE BEEN MORETERRIBLE THAN ONE OF ANGER IT HAD IN IT A DESPAIRING ACCEPTANCE OF THEDISTANCE SHE WAS PLACING BETWEEN THEM.AND WHEN SHALL YOU COME BACK AGAIN HE SAID WITH A BITTER EDGE ONHIS ACCENT.OH IN THE EVENING. OF COURSE I SHALL NOT MENTION THE SUBJECT TOMAMMA. ROSAMOND WAS CONVINCED THAT NO WOMAN COULD BEHAVE MOREIRREPROACHABLY THAN SHE WAS BEHAVING AND SHE WENT TO SIT DOWN AT HERWORKTABLE. LYDGATE SAT MEDITATING A MINUTE OR TWO AND THE RESULT WASTHAT HE SAID WITH SOME OF THE OLD EMOTION IN HIS TONENOW WE HAVE BEEN UNITED ROSY YOU SHOULD NOT LEAVE ME TO MYSELF INTHE FIRST TROUBLE THAT HAS COME.CERTAINLY NOT SAID ROSAMOND I SHALL DO EVERYTHING IT BECOMES ME TODO.IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT THE THING SHOULD BE LEFT TO SERVANTS OR THAT ISHOULD HAVE TO SPEAK TO THEM ABOUT IT. AND I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO GOOUTI DONT KNOW HOW EARLY. I UNDERSTAND YOUR SHRINKING FROM THEHUMILIATION OF THESE MONEY AFFAIRS. BUT MY DEAR ROSAMOND AS AQUESTION OF PRIDE WHICH I FEEL JUST AS MUCH AS YOU CAN IT IS SURELYBETTER TO MANAGE THE THING OURSELVES AND LET THE SERVANTS SEE ASLITTLE OF IT AS POSSIBLE AND SINCE YOU ARE MY WIFE THERE IS NOHINDERING YOUR SHARE IN MY DISGRACESIF THERE WERE DISGRACES.ROSAMOND DID NOT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY BUT AT LAST SHE SAID VERY WELLI WILL STAY AT HOME.I SHALL NOT TOUCH THESE JEWELS ROSY. TAKE THEM AWAY AGAIN. BUT I WILLWRITE OUT A LIST OF PLATE THAT WE MAY RETURN AND THAT CAN BE PACKED UPAND SENT AT ONCE.THE SERVANTS WILL KNOW THAT SAID ROSAMOND WITH THE SLIGHTESTTOUCH OF SARCASM.WELL WE MUST MEET SOME DISAGREEABLES AS NECESSITIES. WHERE IS THEINK I WONDER SAID LYDGATE RISING AND THROWING THE ACCOUNT ON THELARGER TABLE WHERE HE MEANT TO WRITE.ROSAMOND WENT TO REACH THE INKSTAND AND AFTER SETTING IT ON THE TABLEWAS GOING TO TURN AWAY WHEN LYDGATE WHO WAS STANDING CLOSE BY PUTHIS ARM ROUND HER AND DREW HER TOWARDS HIM SAYINGCOME DARLING LET US MAKE THE BEST OF THINGS. IT WILL ONLY BE FOR ATIME I HOPE THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO BE STINGY AND PARTICULAR. KISS ME.HIS NATIVE WARMHEARTEDNESS TOOK A GREAT DEAL OF QUENCHING AND IT IS APART OF MANLINESS FOR A HUSBAND TO FEEL KEENLY THE FACT THAT ANINEXPERIENCED GIRL HAS GOT INTO TROUBLE BY MARRYING HIM. SHE RECEIVEDHIS KISS AND RETURNED IT FAINTLY AND IN THIS WAY AN APPEARANCE OFACCORD WAS RECOVERED FOR THE TIME. BUT LYDGATE COULD NOT HELP LOOKINGFORWARD WITH DREAD TO THE INEVITABLE FUTURE DISCUSSIONS ABOUTEXPENDITURE AND THE NECESSITY FOR A COMPLETE CHANGE IN THEIR WAY OFLIVING.CHAPTER LIX.THEY SAID OF OLD THE SOUL HAD HUMAN SHAPEBUT SMALLER SUBTLER THAN THE FLESHLY SELFSO WANDERED FORTH FOR AIRING WHEN IT PLEASED.AND SEE BESIDE HER CHERUBFACE THERE FLOATSA PALELIPPED FORM AERIAL WHISPERINGITS PROMPTINGS IN THAT LITTLE SHELL HER EAR.NEWS IS OFTEN DISPERSED AS THOUGHTLESSLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS THAT POLLENWHICH THE BEES CARRY OFF HAVING NO IDEA HOW POWDERY THEY ARE WHENTHEY ARE BUZZING IN SEARCH OF THEIR PARTICULAR NECTAR. THIS FINECOMPARISON HAS REFERENCE TO FRED VINCY WHO ON THAT EVENING AT LOWICKPARSONAGE HEARD A LIVELY DISCUSSION AMONG THE LADIES ON THE NEWS WHICHTHEIR OLD SERVANT HAD GOT FROM TANTRIPP CONCERNING MR. CASAUBONSSTRANGE MENTION OF MR. LADISLAW IN A CODICIL TO HIS WILL MADE NOT LONGBEFORE HIS DEATH. MISS WINIFRED WAS ASTOUNDED TO FIND THAT HER BROTHERHAD KNOWN THE FACT BEFORE AND OBSERVED THAT CAMDEN WAS THE MOSTWONDERFUL MAN FOR KNOWING THINGS AND NOT TELLING THEM WHEREUPON MARYGARTH SAID THAT THE CODICIL HAD PERHAPS GOT MIXED UP WITH THE HABITS OFSPIDERS WHICH MISS WINIFRED NEVER WOULD LISTEN TO. MRS. FAREBROTHERCONSIDERED THAT THE NEWS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEIR HAVING ONLYONCE SEEN MR. LADISLAW AT LOWICK AND MISS NOBLE MADE MANY SMALLCOMPASSIONATE MEWINGS.FRED KNEW LITTLE AND CARED LESS ABOUT LADISLAW AND THE CASAUBONS ANDHIS MIND NEVER RECURRED TO THAT DISCUSSION TILL ONE DAY CALLING ONROSAMOND AT HIS MOTHERS REQUEST TO DELIVER A MESSAGE AS HE PASSED HEHAPPENED TO SEE LADISLAW GOING AWAY. FRED AND ROSAMOND HAD LITTLE TOSAY TO EACH OTHER NOW THAT MARRIAGE HAD REMOVED HER FROM COLLISION WITHTHE UNPLEASANTNESS OF BROTHERS AND ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HE HAD TAKENWHAT SHE HELD THE STUPID AND EVEN REPREHENSIBLE STEP OF GIVING UP THECHURCH TO TAKE TO SUCH A BUSINESS AS MR. GARTHS. HENCE FRED TALKED BYPREFERENCE OF WHAT HE CONSIDERED INDIFFERENT NEWS AND A PROPOS OFTHAT YOUNG LADISLAW MENTIONED WHAT HE HAD HEARD AT LOWICK PARSONAGE.NOW LYDGATE LIKE MR. FAREBROTHER KNEW A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN HE TOLDAND WHEN HE HAD ONCE BEEN SET THINKING ABOUT THE RELATION BETWEEN WILLAND DOROTHEA HIS CONJECTURES HAD GONE BEYOND THE FACT. HE IMAGINED THATTHERE WAS A PASSIONATE ATTACHMENT ON BOTH SIDES AND THIS STRUCK HIM ASMUCH TOO SERIOUS TO GOSSIP ABOUT. HE REMEMBERED WILLS IRRITABILITYWHEN HE HAD MENTIONED MRS. CASAUBON AND WAS THE MORE CIRCUMSPECT. ONTHE WHOLE HIS SURMISES IN ADDITION TO WHAT HE KNEW OF THE FACTINCREASED HIS FRIENDLINESS AND TOLERANCE TOWARDS LADISLAW AND MADE HIMUNDERSTAND THE VACILLATION WHICH KEPT HIM AT MIDDLEMARCH AFTER HE HADSAID THAT HE SHOULD GO AWAY. IT WAS SIGNIFICANT OF THE SEPARATENESSBETWEEN LYDGATES MIND AND ROSAMONDS THAT HE HAD NO IMPULSE TO SPEAKTO HER ON THE SUBJECT INDEED HE DID NOT QUITE TRUST HER RETICENCETOWARDS WILL. AND HE WAS RIGHT THERE THOUGH HE HAD NO VISION OF THEWAY IN WHICH HER MIND WOULD ACT IN URGING HER TO SPEAK.WHEN SHE REPEATED FREDS NEWS TO LYDGATE HE SAID TAKE CARE YOU DONTDROP THE FAINTEST HINT TO LADISLAW ROSY. HE IS LIKELY TO FLY OUT AS IFYOU INSULTED HIM. OF COURSE IT IS A PAINFUL AFFAIR.ROSAMOND TURNED HER NECK AND PATTED HER HAIR LOOKING THE IMAGE OFPLACID INDIFFERENCE. BUT THE NEXT TIME WILL CAME WHEN LYDGATE WAS AWAYSHE SPOKE ARCHLY ABOUT HIS NOT GOING TO LONDON AS HE HAD THREATENED.I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT. I HAVE A CONFIDENTIAL LITTLE BIRD SAID SHESHOWING VERY PRETTY AIRS OF HER HEAD OVER THE BIT OF WORK HELD HIGHBETWEEN HER ACTIVE FINGERS. THERE IS A POWERFUL MAGNET IN THISNEIGHBORHOOD.TO BE SURE THERE IS. NOBODY KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN YOU SAID WILLWITH LIGHT GALLANTRY BUT INWARDLY PREPARED TO BE ANGRY.IT IS REALLY THE MOST CHARMING ROMANCE MR. CASAUBON JEALOUS ANDFORESEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE WHOM MRS. CASAUBON WOULD SO MUCHLIKE TO MARRY AND NO ONE WHO WOULD SO MUCH LIKE TO MARRY HER AS ACERTAIN GENTLEMAN AND THEN LAYING A PLAN TO SPOIL ALL BY MAKING HERFORFEIT HER PROPERTY IF SHE DID MARRY THAT GENTLEMANAND THENANDTHENAND THENOH I HAVE NO DOUBT THE END WILL BE THOROUGHLY ROMANTIC.GREAT GOD WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID WILL FLUSHING OVER FACE AND EARSHIS FEATURES SEEMING TO CHANGE AS IF HE HAD HAD A VIOLENT SHAKE. DONTJOKE TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN.YOU DONT REALLY KNOW SAID ROSAMOND NO LONGER PLAYFUL AND DESIRINGNOTHING BETTER THAN TO TELL IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT EVOKE EFFECTS.NO HE RETURNED IMPATIENTLY.DONT KNOW THAT MR. CASAUBON HAS LEFT IT IN HIS WILL THAT IF MRS.CASAUBON MARRIES YOU SHE IS TO FORFEIT ALL HER PROPERTYHOW DO YOU KNOW THAT IT IS TRUE SAID WILL EAGERLY.MY BROTHER FRED HEARD IT FROM THE FAREBROTHERS. WILL STARTED UP FROMHIS CHAIR AND REACHED HIS HAT.I DARE SAY SHE LIKES YOU BETTER THAN THE PROPERTY SAID ROSAMONDLOOKING AT HIM FROM A DISTANCE.PRAY DONT SAY ANY MORE ABOUT IT SAID WILL IN A HOARSE UNDERTONEEXTREMELY UNLIKE HIS USUAL LIGHT VOICE. IT IS A FOUL INSULT TO HER ANDTO ME. THEN HE SAT DOWN ABSENTLY LOOKING BEFORE HIM BUT SEEINGNOTHING.NOW YOU ARE ANGRY WITH ME SAID ROSAMOND. IT IS TOO BAD TO BEARME MALICE. YOU OUGHT TO BE OBLIGED TO ME FOR TELLING YOU.SO I AM SAID WILL ABRUPTLY SPEAKING WITH THAT KIND OF DOUBLE SOULWHICH BELONGS TO DREAMERS WHO ANSWER QUESTIONS.I EXPECT TO HEAR OF THE MARRIAGE SAID ROSAMOND PLAYFULLY.NEVER YOU WILL NEVER HEAR OF THE MARRIAGEWITH THOSE WORDS UTTERED IMPETUOUSLY WILL ROSE PUT OUT HIS HAND TOROSAMOND STILL WITH THE AIR OF A SOMNAMBULIST AND WENT AWAY.WHEN HE WAS GONE ROSAMOND LEFT HER CHAIR AND WALKED TO THE OTHER ENDOF THE ROOM LEANING WHEN SHE GOT THERE AGAINST A CHIFFONNIERE ANDLOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW WEARILY. SHE WAS OPPRESSED BY ENNUI AND BYTHAT DISSATISFACTION WHICH IN WOMENS MINDS IS CONTINUALLY TURNING INTOA TRIVIAL JEALOUSY REFERRING TO NO REAL CLAIMS SPRINGING FROM NODEEPER PASSION THAN THE VAGUE EXACTINGNESS OF EGOISM AND YET CAPABLEOF IMPELLING ACTION AS WELL AS SPEECH. THERE REALLY IS NOTHING TO CAREFOR MUCH SAID POOR ROSAMOND INWARDLY THINKING OF THE FAMILY ATQUALLINGHAM WHO DID NOT WRITE TO HER AND THAT PERHAPS TERTIUS WHEN HECAME HOME WOULD TEASE HER ABOUT EXPENSES. SHE HAD ALREADY SECRETLYDISOBEYED HIM BY ASKING HER FATHER TO HELP THEM AND HE HAD ENDEDDECISIVELY BY SAYING I AM MORE LIKELY TO WANT HELP MYSELF.CHAPTER LX.GOOD PHRASES ARE SURELY AND EVER WERE VERY COMMENDABLE.JUSTICE SHALLOW.A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDSIT WAS ALREADY THE END OF AUGUSTTHERE WAS ANOCCASION WHICH CAUSED SOME EXCITEMENT IN MIDDLEMARCH THE PUBLIC IF ITCHOSE WAS TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BUYING UNDER THE DISTINGUISHEDAUSPICES OF MR. BORTHROP TRUMBULL THE FURNITURE BOOKS AND PICTURESWHICH ANYBODY MIGHT SEE BY THE HANDBILLS TO BE THE BEST IN EVERY KINDBELONGING TO EDWIN LARCHER ESQ. THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THE SALESINDICATING THE DEPRESSION OF TRADE ON THE CONTRARY IT WAS DUE TO MR.LARCHERS GREAT SUCCESS IN THE CARRYING BUSINESS WHICH WARRANTED HISPURCHASE OF A MANSION NEAR RIVERSTON ALREADY FURNISHED IN HIGH STYLE BYAN ILLUSTRIOUS SPA PHYSICIANFURNISHED INDEED WITH SUCH LARGE FRAMEFULSOF EXPENSIVE FLESHPAINTING IN THE DININGROOM THAT MRS. LARCHER WASNERVOUS UNTIL REASSURED BY FINDING THE SUBJECTS TO BE SCRIPTURAL. HENCETHE FINE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASERS WHICH WAS WELL POINTED OUT IN THEHANDBILLS OF MR. BORTHROP TRUMBULL WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE HISTORYOF ART ENABLED HIM TO STATE THAT THE HALL FURNITURE TO BE SOLD WITHOUTRESERVE COMPRISED A PIECE OF CARVING BY A CONTEMPORARY OF GIBBONS.AT MIDDLEMARCH IN THOSE TIMES A LARGE SALE WAS REGARDED AS A KIND OFFESTIVAL. THERE WAS A TABLE SPREAD WITH THE BEST COLD EATABLES AS AT ASUPERIOR FUNERAL AND FACILITIES WERE OFFERED FOR THATGENEROUSDRINKING OF CHEERFUL GLASSES WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO GENEROUS ANDCHEERFUL BIDDING FOR UNDESIRABLE ARTICLES. MR. LARCHERS SALE WAS THEMORE ATTRACTIVE IN THE FINE WEATHER BECAUSE THE HOUSE STOOD JUST AT THEEND OF THE TOWN WITH A GARDEN AND STABLES ATTACHED IN THAT PLEASANTISSUE FROM MIDDLEMARCH CALLED THE LONDON ROAD WHICH WAS ALSO THE ROADTO THE NEW HOSPITAL AND TO MR. BULSTRODES RETIRED RESIDENCE KNOWN ASTHE SHRUBS. IN SHORT THE AUCTION WAS AS GOOD AS A FAIR AND DREW ALLCLASSES WITH LEISURE AT COMMAND TO SOME WHO RISKED MAKING BIDS INORDER SIMPLY TO RAISE PRICES IT WAS ALMOST EQUAL TO BETTING AT THERACES. THE SECOND DAY WHEN THE BEST FURNITURE WAS TO BE SOLDEVERYBODY WAS THERE EVEN MR. THESIGER THE RECTOR OF ST. PETERSHAD LOOKED IN FOR A SHORT TIME WISHING TO BUY THE CARVED TABLE ANDHAD RUBBED ELBOWS WITH MR. BAMBRIDGE AND MR. HORROCK. THERE WAS AWREATH OF MIDDLEMARCH LADIES ACCOMMODATED WITH SEATS ROUND THE LARGETABLE IN THE DININGROOM WHERE MR. BORTHROP TRUMBULL WAS MOUNTED WITHDESK AND HAMMER BUT THE ROWS CHIEFLY OF MASCULINE FACES BEHIND WEREOFTEN VARIED BY INCOMINGS AND OUTGOINGS BOTH FROM THE DOOR AND THELARGE BOWWINDOW OPENING ON TO THE LAWN.EVERYBODY THAT DAY DID NOT INCLUDE MR. BULSTRODE WHOSE HEALTH COULDNOT WELL ENDURE CROWDS AND DRAUGHTS. BUT MRS. BULSTRODE HADPARTICULARLY WISHED TO HAVE A CERTAIN PICTUREA SUPPER AT EMMAUSATTRIBUTED IN THE CATALOGUE TO GUIDO AND AT THE LAST MOMENT BEFORE THEDAY OF THE SALE MR. BULSTRODE HAD CALLED AT THE OFFICE OF THEPIONEER OF WHICH HE WAS NOW ONE OF THE PROPRIETORS TO BEG OF MR.LADISLAW AS A GREAT FAVOR THAT HE WOULD OBLIGINGLY USE HIS REMARKABLEKNOWLEDGE OF PICTURES ON BEHALF OF MRS. BULSTRODE AND JUDGE OF THEVALUE OF THIS PARTICULAR PAINTINGIF ADDED THE SCRUPULOUSLY POLITEBANKER ATTENDANCE AT THE SALE WOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH THEARRANGEMENTS FOR YOUR DEPARTURE WHICH I KNOW IS IMMINENT.THIS PROVISO MIGHT HAVE SOUNDED RATHER SATIRICALLY IN WILLS EAR IF HEHAD BEEN IN A MOOD TO CARE ABOUT SUCH SATIRE. IT REFERRED TO ANUNDERSTANDING ENTERED INTO MANY WEEKS BEFORE WITH THE PROPRIETORS OFTHE PAPER THAT HE SHOULD BE AT LIBERTY ANY DAY HE PLEASED TO HAND OVERTHE MANAGEMENT TO THE SUBEDITOR WHOM HE HAD BEEN TRAINING SINCE HEWISHED FINALLY TO QUIT MIDDLEMARCH. BUT INDEFINITE VISIONS OF AMBITIONARE WEAK AGAINST THE EASE OF DOING WHAT IS HABITUAL OR BEGUILINGLYAGREEABLE AND WE ALL KNOW THE DIFFICULTY OF CARRYING OUT A RESOLVEWHEN WE SECRETLY LONG THAT IT MAY TURN OUT TO BE UNNECESSARY. IN SUCHSTATES OF MIND THE MOST INCREDULOUS PERSON HAS A PRIVATE LEANINGTOWARDS MIRACLE IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE HOW OUR WISH COULD BEFULFILLED STILLVERY WONDERFUL THINGS HAVE HAPPENED WILL DID NOTCONFESS THIS WEAKNESS TO HIMSELF BUT HE LINGERED. WHAT WAS THE USE OFGOING TO LONDON AT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR THE RUGBY MEN WHO WOULDREMEMBER HIM WERE NOT THERE AND SO FAR AS POLITICAL WRITING WASCONCERNED HE WOULD RATHER FOR A FEW WEEKS GO ON WITH THE PIONEER. ATTHE PRESENT MOMENT HOWEVER WHEN MR. BULSTRODE WAS SPEAKING TO HIM HEHAD BOTH A STRENGTHENED RESOLVE TO GO AND AN EQUALLY STRONG RESOLVE NOTTO GO TILL HE HAD ONCE MORE SEEN DOROTHEA. HENCE HE REPLIED THAT HE HADREASONS FOR DEFERRING HIS DEPARTURE A LITTLE AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO GOTO THE SALE.WILL WAS IN A DEFIANT MOOD HIS CONSCIOUSNESS BEING DEEPLY STUNG WITHTHE THOUGHT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO LOOKED AT HIM PROBABLY KNEW A FACTTANTAMOUNT TO AN ACCUSATION AGAINST HIM AS A FELLOW WITH LOW DESIGNSWHICH WERE TO BE FRUSTRATED BY A DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY. LIKE MOST PEOPLEWHO ASSERT THEIR FREEDOM WITH REGARD TO CONVENTIONAL DISTINCTION HEWAS PREPARED TO BE SUDDEN AND QUICK AT QUARREL WITH ANY ONE WHO MIGHTHINT THAT HE HAD PERSONAL REASONS FOR THAT ASSERTIONTHAT THERE WASANYTHING IN HIS BLOOD HIS BEARING OR HIS CHARACTER TO WHICH HE GAVETHE MASK OF AN OPINION. WHEN HE WAS UNDER AN IRRITATING IMPRESSION OFTHIS KIND HE WOULD GO ABOUT FOR DAYS WITH A DEFIANT LOOK THE COLORCHANGING IN HIS TRANSPARENT SKIN AS IF HE WERE ON THE QUI VIVEWATCHING FOR SOMETHING WHICH HE HAD TO DART UPON.THIS EXPRESSION WAS PECULIARLY NOTICEABLE IN HIM AT THE SALE AND THOSEWHO HAD ONLY SEEN HIM IN HIS MOODS OF GENTLE ODDITY OR OF BRIGHTENJOYMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK WITH A CONTRAST. HE WAS NOT SORRY TOHAVE THIS OCCASION FOR APPEARING IN PUBLIC BEFORE THE MIDDLEMARCHTRIBES OF TOLLER HACKBUTT AND THE REST WHO LOOKED DOWN ON HIM AS ANADVENTURER AND WERE IN A STATE OF BRUTAL IGNORANCE ABOUT DANTEWHOSNEERED AT HIS POLISH BLOOD AND WERE THEMSELVES OF A BREED VERY MUCHIN NEED OF CROSSING. HE STOOD IN A CONSPICUOUS PLACE NOT FAR FROM THEAUCTIONEER WITH A FOREFINGER IN EACH SIDEPOCKET AND HIS HEAD THROWNBACKWARD NOT CARING TO SPEAK TO ANYBODY THOUGH HE HAD BEEN CORDIALLYWELCOMED AS A CONNOISSURE BY MR. TRUMBULL WHO WAS ENJOYING THEUTMOST ACTIVITY OF HIS GREAT FACULTIES.AND SURELY AMONG ALL MEN WHOSE VOCATION REQUIRES THEM TO EXHIBIT THEIRPOWERS OF SPEECH THE HAPPIEST IS A PROSPEROUS PROVINCIAL AUCTIONEERKEENLY ALIVE TO HIS OWN JOKES AND SENSIBLE OF HIS ENCYCLOPEDICKNOWLEDGE. SOME SATURNINE SOURBLOODED PERSONS MIGHT OBJECT TO BECONSTANTLY INSISTING ON THE MERITS OF ALL ARTICLES FROM BOOTJACKS TOBERGHEMS BUT MR. BORTHROP TRUMBULL HAD A KINDLY LIQUID IN HIS VEINSHE WAS AN ADMIRER BY NATURE AND WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE THE UNIVERSEUNDER HIS HAMMER FEELING THAT IT WOULD GO AT A HIGHER FIGURE FOR HISRECOMMENDATION.MEANWHILE MRS. LARCHERS DRAWINGROOM FURNITURE WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM.WHEN WILL LADISLAW HAD COME IN A SECOND FENDER SAID TO HAVE BEENFORGOTTEN IN ITS RIGHT PLACE SUDDENLY CLAIMED THE AUCTIONEERSENTHUSIASM WHICH HE DISTRIBUTED ON THE EQUITABLE PRINCIPLE OF PRAISINGTHOSE THINGS MOST WHICH WERE MOST IN NEED OF PRAISE.

WILL LOOKEDAFTER HIM A MOMENT AND COULD SEE THAT HE DID NOT REENTER THEAUCTIONROOM BUT APPEARED TO BE WALKING TOWARDS THE ROAD. FOR ANINSTANT HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BEEN FOOLISH NOT TO LET THE MAN GO ONTALKINGBUT NO ON THE WHOLE HE PREFERRED DOING WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE FROMTHAT SOURCE.LATER IN THE EVENING HOWEVER RAFFLES OVERTOOK HIM IN THE STREET ANDAPPEARING EITHER TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THE ROUGHNESS OF HIS FORMERRECEPTION OR TO INTEND AVENGING IT BY A FORGIVING FAMILIARITY GREETEDHIM JOVIALLY AND WALKED BY HIS SIDE REMARKING AT FIRST ON THEPLEASANTNESS OF THE TOWN AND NEIGHBORHOOD. WILL SUSPECTED THAT THE MANHAD BEEN DRINKING AND WAS CONSIDERING HOW TO SHAKE HIM OFF WHEN RAFFLESSAIDIVE BEEN ABROAD MYSELF MR. LADISLAWIVE SEEN THE WORLDUSED TOPARLEYVOUS A LITTLE. IT WAS AT BOULOGNE I SAW YOUR FATHERA MOSTUNCOMMON LIKENESS YOU ARE OF HIM BY JOVE MOUTHNOSEEYESHAIR TURNEDOFF YOUR BROW JUST LIKE HISA LITTLE IN THE FOREIGN STYLE. JOHN BULLDOESNT DO MUCH OF THAT. BUT YOUR FATHER WAS VERY ILL WHEN I SAW HIM.LORD LORD HANDS YOU MIGHT SEE THROUGH. YOU WERE A SMALL YOUNGSTERTHEN.

BUT LORD SARAH WOULD HAVE KNOWNNOTHING ABOUT ITA DASHING YOUNG LADY SHE WASFINE BOARDINGSCHOOLFITFOR A LORDS WIFEONLY ARCHIE DUNCAN THREW IT AT HER OUT OF SPITEBECAUSE SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM. AND SO SHE RAN AWAY FROMTHE WHOLE CONCERN. I TRAVELLED FOR EM SIR IN A GENTLEMANLY WAYAT AHIGH SALARY. THEY DIDNT MIND HER RUNNING AWAY AT FIRSTGODLY FOLKSSIR VERY GODLYAND SHE WAS FOR THE STAGE. THE SON WAS ALIVE THEN ANDTHE DAUGHTER WAS AT A DISCOUNT. HALLO HERE WE ARE AT THE BLUE BULL.WHAT DO YOU SAY MR. LADISLAWSHALL WE TURN IN AND HAVE A GLASSNO I MUST SAY GOOD EVENING SAID WILL DASHING UP A PASSAGE WHICHLED INTO LOWICK GATE AND ALMOST RUNNING TO GET OUT OF RAFFLESS REACH.HE WALKED A LONG WHILE ON THE LOWICK ROAD AWAY FROM THE TOWN GLAD OFTHE STARLIT DARKNESS WHEN IT CAME. HE FELT AS IF HE HAD HAD DIRT CASTON HIM AMIDST SHOUTS OF SCORN. THERE WAS THIS TO CONFIRM THE FELLOWSSTATEMENTTHAT HIS MOTHER NEVER WOULD TELL HIM THE REASON WHY SHE HADRUN AWAY FROM HER FAMILY.WELL WHAT WAS HE WILL LADISLAW THE WORSE SUPPOSING THE TRUTH ABOUTTHAT FAMILY TO BE THE UGLIEST HIS MOTHER HAD BRAVED HARDSHIP IN ORDERTO SEPARATE HERSELF FROM IT. BUT IF DOROTHEAS FRIENDS HAD KNOWN THISSTORYIF THE CHETTAMS HAD KNOWN ITTHEY WOULD HAVE HAD A FINE COLOR TOGIVE THEIR SUSPICIONS A WELCOME GROUND FOR THINKING HIM UNFIT TO COMENEAR HER. HOWEVER LET THEM SUSPECT WHAT THEY PLEASED THEY WOULD FINDTHEMSELVES IN THE WRONG. THEY WOULD FIND OUT THAT THE BLOOD IN HISVEINS WAS AS FREE FROM THE TAINT OF MEANNESS AS THEIRS.CHAPTER LXI.INCONSISTENCIES ANSWERED IMLAC CANNOT BOTH BE RIGHT BUT IMPUTEDTO MAN THEY MAY BOTH BE TRUE.RASSELAS.THE SAME NIGHT WHEN MR. BULSTRODE RETURNED FROM A JOURNEY TO BRASSINGON BUSINESS HIS GOOD WIFE MET HIM IN THE ENTRANCEHALL AND DREW HIMINTO HIS PRIVATE SITTINGROOM.NICHOLAS SHE SAID FIXING HER HONEST EYES UPON HIM ANXIOUSLY THEREHAS BEEN SUCH A DISAGREEABLE MAN HERE ASKING FOR YOUIT HAS MADE MEQUITE UNCOMFORTABLE.WHAT KIND OF MAN MY DEAR SAID MR. BULSTRODE DREADFULLY CERTAIN OFTHE ANSWER.A REDFACED MAN WITH LARGE WHISKERS AND MOST IMPUDENT IN HIS MANNER.HE DECLARED HE WAS AN OLD FRIEND OF YOURS AND SAID YOU WOULD BE SORRYNOT TO SEE HIM. HE WANTED TO WAIT FOR YOU HERE BUT I TOLD HIM HE COULDSEE YOU AT THE BANK TOMORROW MORNING. MOST IMPUDENT HE WASSTARED ATME AND SAID HIS FRIEND NICK HAD LUCK IN WIVES. I DONT BELIEVE HEWOULD HAVE GONE AWAY IF BLUCHER HAD NOT HAPPENED TO BREAK HIS CHAINAND COME RUNNING ROUND ON THE GRAVELFOR I WAS IN THE GARDEN SO ISAID YOUD BETTER GO AWAYTHE DOG IS VERY FIERCE AND I CANT HOLDHIM. DO YOU REALLY KNOW ANYTHING OF SUCH A MANI BELIEVE I KNOW WHO HE IS MY DEAR SAID MR. BULSTRODE IN HIS USUALSUBDUED VOICE AN UNFORTUNATE DISSOLUTE WRETCH WHOM I HELPED TOO MUCHIN DAYS GONE BY. HOWEVER I PRESUME YOU WILL NOT BE TROUBLED BY HIMAGAIN. HE WILL PROBABLY COME TO THE BANKTO BEG DOUBTLESS.NO MORE WAS SAID ON THE SUBJECT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN MR. BULSTRODEHAD RETURNED FROM THE TOWN AND WAS DRESSING FOR DINNER. HIS WIFE NOTSURE THAT HE WAS COME HOME LOOKED INTO HIS DRESSINGROOM AND SAW HIMWITH HIS COAT AND CRAVAT OFF LEANING ONE ARM ON A CHEST OF DRAWERS ANDSTARING ABSENTLY AT THE GROUND. HE STARTED NERVOUSLY AND LOOKED UP ASSHE ENTERED.YOU LOOK VERY ILL NICHOLAS. IS THERE ANYTHING THE MATTERI HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF PAIN IN MY HEAD SAID MR. BULSTRODE WHO WAS SOFREQUENTLY AILING THAT HIS WIFE WAS ALWAYS READY TO BELIEVE IN THISCAUSE OF DEPRESSION.SIT DOWN AND LET ME SPONGE IT WITH VINEGAR.PHYSICALLY MR. BULSTRODE DID NOT WANT THE VINEGAR BUT MORALLY THEAFFECTIONATE ATTENTION SOOTHED HIM. THOUGH ALWAYS POLITE IT WAS HISHABIT TO RECEIVE SUCH SERVICES WITH MARITAL COOLNESS AS HIS WIFESDUTY. BUT TODAY WHILE SHE WAS BENDING OVER HIM HE SAID YOU AREVERY GOOD HARRIET IN A TONE WHICH HAD SOMETHING NEW IN IT TO HEREAR SHE DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE NOVELTY WAS BUT HER WOMANSSOLICITUDE SHAPED ITSELF INTO A DARTING THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT BE GOINGTO HAVE AN ILLNESS.HAS ANYTHING WORRIED YOU SHE SAID. DID THAT MAN COME TO YOU AT THEBANKYES IT WAS AS I HAD SUPPOSED. HE IS A MAN WHO AT ONE TIME MIGHT HAVEDONE BETTER. BUT HE HAS SUNK INTO A DRUNKEN DEBAUCHED CREATURE.IS HE QUITE GONE AWAY SAID MRS. BULSTRODE ANXIOUSLY BUT FORCERTAIN REASONS SHE REFRAINED FROM ADDING IT WAS VERY DISAGREEABLE TOHEAR HIM CALLING HIMSELF A FRIEND OF YOURS. AT THAT MOMENT SHE WOULDNOT HAVE LIKED TO SAY ANYTHING WHICH IMPLIED HER HABITUAL CONSCIOUSNESSTHAT HER HUSBANDS EARLIER CONNECTIONS WERE NOT QUITE ON A LEVEL WITHHER OWN. NOT THAT SHE KNEW MUCH ABOUT THEM. THAT HER HUSBAND HAD ATFIRST BEEN EMPLOYED IN A BANK THAT HE HAD AFTERWARDS ENTERED INTO WHATHE CALLED CITY BUSINESS AND GAINED A FORTUNE BEFORE HE WASTHREEANDTHIRTY THAT HE HAD MARRIED A WIDOW WHO WAS MUCH OLDER THANHIMSELFA DISSENTER AND IN OTHER WAYS PROBABLY OF THAT DISADVANTAGEOUSQUALITY USUALLY PERCEPTIBLE IN A FIRST WIFE IF INQUIRED INTO WITH THEDISPASSIONATE JUDGMENT OF A SECONDWAS ALMOST AS MUCH AS SHE HAD CAREDTO LEARN BEYOND THE GLIMPSES WHICH MR. BULSTRODES NARRATIVEOCCASIONALLY GAVE OF HIS EARLY BENT TOWARDS RELIGION HIS INCLINATIONTO BE A PREACHER AND HIS ASSOCIATION WITH MISSIONARY AND PHILANTHROPICEFFORTS. SHE BELIEVED IN HIM AS AN EXCELLENT MAN WHOSE PIETY CARRIED APECULIAR EMINENCE IN BELONGING TO A LAYMAN WHOSE INFLUENCE HAD TURNEDHER OWN MIND TOWARD SERIOUSNESS AND WHOSE SHARE OF PERISHABLE GOOD HADBEEN THE MEANS OF RAISING HER OWN POSITION. BUT SHE ALSO LIKED TO THINKTHAT IT WAS WELL IN EVERY SENSE FOR MR. BULSTRODE TO HAVE WON THE HANDOF HARRIET VINCY WHOSE FAMILY WAS UNDENIABLE IN A MIDDLEMARCH LIGHTABETTER LIGHT SURELY THAN ANY THROWN IN LONDON THOROUGHFARES ORDISSENTING CHAPELYARDS. THE UNREFORMED PROVINCIAL MIND DISTRUSTEDLONDON AND WHILE TRUE RELIGION WAS EVERYWHERE SAVING HONEST MRS.BULSTRODE WAS CONVINCED THAT TO BE SAVED IN THE CHURCH WAS MORERESPECTABLE. SHE SO MUCH WISHED TO IGNORE TOWARDS OTHERS THAT HERHUSBAND HAD EVER BEEN A LONDON DISSENTER THAT SHE LIKED TO KEEP IT OUTOF SIGHT EVEN IN TALKING TO HIM. HE WAS QUITE AWARE OF THIS INDEED INSOME RESPECTS HE WAS RATHER AFRAID OF THIS INGENUOUS WIFE WHOSEIMITATIVE PIETY AND NATIVE WORLDLINESS WERE EQUALLY SINCERE WHO HADNOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF AND WHOM HE HAD MARRIED OUT OF A THOROUGHINCLINATION STILL SUBSISTING. BUT HIS FEARS WERE SUCH AS BELONG TO AMAN WHO CARES TO MAINTAIN HIS RECOGNIZED SUPREMACY THE LOSS OF HIGHCONSIDERATION FROM HIS WIFE AS FROM EVERY ONE ELSE WHO DID NOT CLEARLYHATE HIM OUT OF ENMITY TO THE TRUTH WOULD BE AS THE BEGINNING OF DEATHTO HIM. WHEN SHE SAIDIS HE QUITE GONE AWAYOH I TRUST SO HE ANSWERED WITH AN EFFORT TO THROW AS MUCH SOBERUNCONCERN INTO HIS TONE AS POSSIBLEBUT IN TRUTH MR. BULSTRODE WAS VERY FAR FROM A STATE OF QUIET TRUST. INTHE INTERVIEW AT THE BANK RAFFLES HAD MADE IT EVIDENT THAT HISEAGERNESS TO TORMENT WAS ALMOST AS STRONG IN HIM AS ANY OTHER GREED. HEHAD FRANKLY SAID THAT HE HAD TURNED OUT OF THE WAY TO COME TOMIDDLEMARCH JUST TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND SEE WHETHER THE NEIGHBORHOODWOULD SUIT HIM TO LIVE IN. HE HAD CERTAINLY HAD A FEW DEBTS TO PAY MORETHAN HE EXPECTED BUT THE TWO HUNDRED POUNDS WERE NOT GONE YET A COOLFIVEANDTWENTY WOULD SUFFICE HIM TO GO AWAY WITH FOR THE PRESENT. WHATHE HAD WANTED CHIEFLY WAS TO SEE HIS FRIEND NICK AND FAMILY AND KNOWALL ABOUT THE PROSPERITY OF A MAN TO WHOM HE WAS SO MUCH ATTACHED.BYANDBY HE MIGHT COME BACK FOR A LONGER STAY. THIS TIME RAFFLESDECLINED TO BE SEEN OFF THE PREMISES AS HE EXPRESSED ITDECLINED TOQUIT MIDDLEMARCH UNDER BULSTRODES EYES. HE MEANT TO GO BY COACH THENEXT DAYIF HE CHOSE.BULSTRODE FELT HIMSELF HELPLESS. NEITHER THREATS NOR COAXING COULDAVAIL HE COULD NOT COUNT ON ANY PERSISTENT FEAR NOR ON ANY PROMISE. ONTHE CONTRARY HE FELT A COLD CERTAINTY AT HIS HEART THAT RAFFLESUNLESSPROVIDENCE SENT DEATH TO HINDER HIMWOULD COME BACK TO MIDDLEMARCHBEFORE LONG. AND THAT CERTAINTY WAS A TERROR.IT WAS NOT THAT HE WAS IN DANGER OF LEGAL PUNISHMENT OR OF BEGGARY HEWAS IN DANGER ONLY OF SEEING DISCLOSED TO THE JUDGMENT OF HIS NEIGHBORSAND THE MOURNFUL PERCEPTION OF HIS WIFE CERTAIN FACTS OF HIS PAST LIFEWHICH WOULD RENDER HIM AN OBJECT OF SCORN AND AN OPPROBRIUM OF THERELIGION WITH WHICH HE HAD DILIGENTLY ASSOCIATED HIMSELF. THE TERROR OFBEING JUDGED SHARPENS THE MEMORY IT SENDS AN INEVITABLE GLARE OVERTHAT LONGUNVISITED PAST WHICH HAS BEEN HABITUALLY RECALLED ONLY INGENERAL PHRASES. EVEN WITHOUT MEMORY THE LIFE IS BOUND INTO ONE BY AZONE OF DEPENDENCE IN GROWTH AND DECAY BUT INTENSE MEMORY FORCES A MANTO OWN HIS BLAMEWORTHY PAST. WITH MEMORY SET SMARTING LIKE A REOPENEDWOUND A MANS PAST IS NOT SIMPLY A DEAD HISTORY AN OUTWORNPREPARATION OF THE PRESENT IT IS NOT A REPENTED ERROR SHAKEN LOOSEFROM THE LIFE IT IS A STILL QUIVERING PART OF HIMSELF BRINGINGSHUDDERS AND BITTER FLAVORS AND THE TINGLINGS OF A MERITED SHAME.INTO THIS SECOND LIFE BULSTRODES PAST HAD NOW RISEN ONLY THEPLEASURES OF IT SEEMING TO HAVE LOST THEIR QUALITY. NIGHT AND DAYWITHOUT INTERRUPTION SAVE OF BRIEF SLEEP WHICH ONLY WOVE RETROSPECT ANDFEAR INTO A FANTASTIC PRESENT HE FELT THE SCENES OF HIS EARLIER LIFECOMING BETWEEN HIM AND EVERYTHING ELSE AS OBSTINATELY AS WHEN WE LOOKTHROUGH THE WINDOW FROM A LIGHTED ROOM THE OBJECTS WE TURN OUR BACKSON ARE STILL BEFORE US INSTEAD OF THE GRASS AND THE TREES. THESUCCESSIVE EVENTS INWARD AND OUTWARD WERE THERE IN ONE VIEW THOUGHEACH MIGHT BE DWELT ON IN TURN THE REST STILL KEPT THEIR HOLD IN THECONSCIOUSNESS.ONCE MORE HE SAW HIMSELF THE YOUNG BANKERS CLERK WITH AN AGREEABLEPERSON AS CLEVER IN FIGURES AS HE WAS FLUENT IN SPEECH AND FOND OFTHEOLOGICAL DEFINITION AN EMINENT THOUGH YOUNG MEMBER OF A CALVINISTICDISSENTING CHURCH AT HIGHBURY HAVING HAD STRIKING EXPERIENCE INCONVICTION OF SIN AND SENSE OF PARDON. AGAIN HE HEARD HIMSELF CALLEDFOR AS BROTHER BULSTRODE IN PRAYER MEETINGS SPEAKING ON RELIGIOUSPLATFORMS PREACHING IN PRIVATE HOUSES. AGAIN HE FELT HIMSELF THINKINGOF THE MINISTRY AS POSSIBLY HIS VOCATION AND INCLINED TOWARDSMISSIONARY LABOR. THAT WAS THE HAPPIEST TIME OF HIS LIFE THAT WAS THESPOT HE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN NOW TO AWAKE IN AND FIND THE REST A DREAM.THE PEOPLE AMONG WHOM BROTHER BULSTRODE WAS DISTINGUISHED WERE VERYFEW BUT THEY WERE VERY NEAR TO HIM AND STIRRED HIS SATISFACTION THEMORE HIS POWER STRETCHED THROUGH A NARROW SPACE BUT HE FELT ITSEFFECT THE MORE INTENSELY. HE BELIEVED WITHOUT EFFORT IN THE PECULIARWORK OF GRACE WITHIN HIM AND IN THE SIGNS THAT GOD INTENDED HIM FORSPECIAL INSTRUMENTALITY.THEN CAME THE MOMENT OF TRANSITION IT WAS WITH THE SENSE OF PROMOTIONHE HAD WHEN HE AN ORPHAN EDUCATED AT A COMMERCIAL CHARITYSCHOOL WASINVITED TO A FINE VILLA BELONGING TO MR. DUNKIRK THE RICHEST MAN INTHE CONGREGATION. SOON HE BECAME AN INTIMATE THERE HONORED FOR HISPIETY BY THE WIFE MARKED OUT FOR HIS ABILITY BY THE HUSBAND WHOSEWEALTH WAS DUE TO A FLOURISHING CITY AND WESTEND TRADE. THAT WAS THESETTINGIN OF A NEW CURRENT FOR HIS AMBITION DIRECTING HIS PROSPECTSOF INSTRUMENTALITY TOWARDS THE UNITING OF DISTINGUISHED RELIGIOUSGIFTS WITH SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.BYANDBY CAME A DECIDED EXTERNAL LEADING A CONFIDENTIAL SUBORDINATEPARTNER DIED AND NOBODY SEEMED TO THE PRINCIPAL SO WELL FITTED TO FILLTHE SEVERELY FELT VACANCY AS HIS YOUNG FRIEND BULSTRODE IF HE WOULDBECOME CONFIDENTIAL ACCOUNTANT. THE OFFER WAS ACCEPTED. THE BUSINESSWAS A PAWNBROKERS OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT SORT BOTH IN EXTENT ANDPROFITS AND ON A SHORT ACQUAINTANCE WITH IT BULSTRODE BECAME AWARETHAT ONE SOURCE OF MAGNIFICENT PROFIT WAS THE EASY RECEPTION OF ANYGOODS OFFERED WITHOUT STRICT INQUIRY AS TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM. BUTTHERE WAS A BRANCH HOUSE AT THE WEST END AND NO PETTINESS OR DINGINESSTO GIVE SUGGESTIONS OF SHAME.HE REMEMBERED HIS FIRST MOMENTS OF SHRINKING. THEY WERE PRIVATE ANDWERE FILLED WITH ARGUMENTS SOME OF THESE TAKING THE FORM OF PRAYER.THE BUSINESS WAS ESTABLISHED AND HAD OLD ROOTS IS IT NOT ONE THING TOSET UP A NEW GINPALACE AND ANOTHER TO ACCEPT AN INVESTMENT IN AN OLDONE THE PROFITS MADE OUT OF LOST SOULSWHERE CAN THE LINE BE DRAWN ATWHICH THEY BEGIN IN HUMAN TRANSACTIONS WAS IT NOT EVEN GODS WAY OFSAVING HIS CHOSEN THOU KNOWESTTHE YOUNG BULSTRODE HAD SAID THENAS THE OLDER BULSTRODE WAS SAYING NOWTHOU KNOWEST HOW LOOSE MY SOULSITS FROM THESE THINGSHOW I VIEW THEM ALL AS IMPLEMENTS FOR TILLINGTHY GARDEN RESCUED HERE AND THERE FROM THE WILDERNESS.METAPHORS AND PRECEDENTS WERE NOT WANTING PECULIAR SPIRITUALEXPERIENCES WERE NOT WANTING WHICH AT LAST MADE THE RETENTION OF HISPOSITION SEEM A SERVICE DEMANDED OF HIM THE VISTA OF A FORTUNE HADALREADY OPENED ITSELF AND BULSTRODES SHRINKING REMAINED PRIVATE. MR.DUNKIRK HAD NEVER EXPECTED THAT THERE WOULD BE ANY SHRINKING AT ALL HEHAD NEVER CONCEIVED THAT TRADE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SCHEME OFSALVATION. AND IT WAS TRUE THAT BULSTRODE FOUND HIMSELF CARRYING ON TWODISTINCT LIVES HIS RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY COULD NOT BE INCOMPATIBLE WITHHIS BUSINESS AS SOON AS HE HAD ARGUED HIMSELF INTO NOT FEELING ITINCOMPATIBLE.MENTALLY SURROUNDED WITH THAT PAST AGAIN BULSTRODE HAD THE SAMEPLEASINDEED THE YEARS HAD BEEN PERPETUALLY SPINNING THEM INTOINTRICATE THICKNESS LIKE MASSES OF SPIDERWEB PADDING THE MORALSENSIBILITY NAY AS AGE MADE EGOISM MORE EAGER BUT LESS ENJOYING HISSOUL HAD BECOME MORE SATURATED WITH THE BELIEF THAT HE DID EVERYTHINGFOR GODS SAKE BEING INDIFFERENT TO IT FOR HIS OWN. AND YETIF HECOULD BE BACK IN THAT FAROFF SPOT WITH HIS YOUTHFUL POVERTYWHY THENHE WOULD CHOOSE TO BE A MISSIONARY.BUT THE TRAIN OF CAUSES IN WHICH HE HAD LOCKED HIMSELF WENT ON. THEREWAS TROUBLE IN THE FINE VILLA AT HIGHBURY. YEARS BEFORE THE ONLYDAUGHTER HAD RUN AWAY DEFIED HER PARENTS AND GONE ON THE STAGE ANDNOW THE ONLY BOY DIED AND AFTER A SHORT TIME MR. DUNKIRK DIED ALSO.THE WIFE A SIMPLE PIOUS WOMAN LEFT WITH ALL THE WEALTH IN AND OUT OFTHE MAGNIFICENT TRADE OF WHICH SHE NEVER KNEW THE PRECISE NATURE HADCOME TO BELIEVE IN BULSTRODE AND INNOCENTLY ADORE HIM AS WOMEN OFTENADORE THEIR PRIEST OR MANMADE MINISTER. IT WAS NATURAL THAT AFTER ATIME MARRIAGE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THOUGHT OF BETWEEN THEM. BUT MRS.DUNKIRK HAD QUALMS AND YEARNINGS ABOUT HER DAUGHTER WHO HAD LONG BEENREGARDED AS LOST BOTH TO GOD AND HER PARENTS. IT WAS KNOWN THAT THEDAUGHTER HAD MARRIED BUT SHE WAS UTTERLY GONE OUT OF SIGHT. THEMOTHER HAVING LOST HER BOY IMAGINED A GRANDSON AND WISHED IN ADOUBLE SENSE TO RECLAIM HER DAUGHTER. IF SHE WERE FOUND THERE WOULD BEA CHANNEL FOR PROPERTYPERHAPS A WIDE ONEIN THE PROVISION FOR SEVERALGRANDCHILDREN. EFFORTS TO FIND HER MUST BE MADE BEFORE MRS. DUNKIRKWOULD MARRY AGAIN. BULSTRODE CONCURRED BUT AFTER ADVERTISEMENT AS WELLAS OTHER MODES OF INQUIRY HAD BEEN TRIED THE MOTHER BELIEVED THAT HERDAUGHTER WAS NOT TO BE FOUND AND CONSENTED TO MARRY WITHOUTRESERVATION OF PROPERTY.THE DAUGHTER HAD BEEN FOUND BUT ONLY ONE MAN BESIDES BULSTRODE KNEWIT AND HE WAS PAID FOR KEEPING SILENCE AND CARRYING HIMSELF AWAY.THAT WAS THE BARE FACT WHICH BULSTRODE WAS NOW FORCED TO SEE IN THERIGID OUTLINE WITH WHICH ACTS PRESENT THEMSELVES TO ONLOOKERS. BUT FORHIMSELF AT THAT DISTANT TIME AND EVEN NOW IN BURNING MEMORY THE FACTWAS BROKEN INTO LITTLE SEQUENCES EACH JUSTIFIED AS IT CAME BYREASONINGS WHICH SEEMED TO PROVE IT RIGHTEOUS. BULSTRODES COURSE UP TOTHAT TIME HAD HE THOUGHT BEEN SANCTIONED BY REMARKABLE PROVIDENCESAPPEARING TO POINT THE WAY FOR HIM TO BE THE AGENT IN MAKING THE BESTUSE OF A LARGE PROPERTY AND WITHDRAWING IT FROM PERVERSION. DEATH ANDOTHER STRIKING DISPOSITIONS SUCH AS FEMININE TRUSTFULNESS HAD COMEAND BULSTRODE WOULD HAVE ADOPTED CROMWELLS WORDSDO YOU CALL THESEBARE EVENTS THE LORD PITY YOU THE EVENTS WERE COMPARATIVELY SMALLBUT THE ESSENTIAL CONDITION WAS THERENAMELY THAT THEY WERE IN FAVOROF HIS OWN ENDS. IT WAS EASY FOR HIM TO SETTLE WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM TOOTHERS BY INQUIRING WHAT WERE GODS INTENTIONS WITH REGARD TO HIMSELF.COULD IT BE FOR GODS SERVICE THAT THIS FORTUNE SHOULD IN ANYCONSIDERABLE PROPORTION GO TO A YOUNG WOMAN AND HER HUSBAND WHO WEREGIVEN UP TO THE LIGHTEST PURSUITS AND MIGHT SCATTER IT ABROAD INTRIVIALITYPEOPLE WHO SEEMED TO LIE OUTSIDE THE PATH OF REMARKABLEPROVIDENCES BULSTRODE HAD NEVER SAID TO HIMSELF BEFOREHAND THEDAUGHTER SHALL NOT BE FOUNDNEVERTHELESS WHEN THE MOMENT CAME HE KEPTHER EXISTENCE HIDDEN AND WHEN OTHER MOMENTS FOLLOWED HE SOOTHED THEMOTHER WITH CONSOLATION IN THE PROBABILITY THAT THE UNHAPPY YOUNG WOMANMIGHT BE NO MORE.THERE WERE HOURS IN WHICH BULSTRODE FELT THAT HIS ACTION WASUNRIGHTEOUS BUT HOW COULD HE GO BACK HE HAD MENTAL EXERCISES CALLEDHIMSELF NOUGHT LAID HOLD ON REDEMPTION AND WENT ON IN HIS COURSE OFINSTRUMENTALITY. AND AFTER FIVE YEARS DEATH AGAIN CAME TO WIDEN HISPATH BY TAKING AWAY HIS WIFE. HE DID GRADUALLY WITHDRAW HIS CAPITALBUT HE DID NOT MAKE THE SACRIFICES REQUISITE TO PUT AN END TO THEBUSINESS WHICH WAS CARRIED ON FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AFTERWARDS BEFORE ITFINALLY COLLAPSED. MEANWHILE NICHOLAS BULSTRODE HAD USED HIS HUNDREDTHOUSAND DISCREETLY AND WAS BECOME PROVINCIALLY SOLIDLY IMPORTANTABANKER A CHURCHMAN A PUBLIC BENEFACTOR ALSO A SLEEPING PARTNER INTRADING CONCERNS IN WHICH HIS ABILITY WAS DIRECTED TO ECONOMY IN THERAW MATERIAL AS IN THE CASE OF THE DYES WHICH ROTTED MR. VINCYS SILK.AND NOW WHEN THIS RESPECTABILITY HAD LASTED UNDISTURBED FOR NEARLYTHIRTY YEARSWHEN ALL THAT PRECEDED IT HAD LONG LAIN BENUMBED IN THECONSCIOUSNESSTHAT PAST HAD RISEN AND IMMERSED HIS THOUGHT AS IF WITHTHE TERRIBLE IRRUPTION OF A NEW SENSE OVERBURTHENING THE FEEBLE BEING.MEANWHILE IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH RAFFLES HE HAD LEARNED SOMETHINGMOMENTOUS SOMETHING WHICH ENTERED ACTIVELY INTO THE STRUGGLE OF HISLONGINGS AND TERRORS. THERE HE THOUGHT LAY AN OPENING TOWARDSSPIRITUAL PERHAPS TOWARDS MATERIAL RESCUE.THE SPIRITUAL KIND OF RESCUE WAS A GENUINE NEED WITH HIM. THERE MAY BECOARSE HYPOCRITES WHO CONSCIOUSLY AFFECT BELIEFS AND EMOTIONS FOR THESAKE OF GULLING THE WORLD BUT BULSTRODE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM. HE WASSIMPLY A MAN WHOSE DESIRES HAD BEEN STRONGER THAN HIS THEORETICBELIEFS AND WHO HAD GRADUALLY EXPLAINED THE GRATIFICATION OF HISDESIRES INTO SATISFACTORY AGREEMENT WITH THOSE BELIEFS. IF THIS BEHYPOCRISY IT IS A PROCESS WHICH SHOWS ITSELF OCCASIONALLY IN US ALLTO WHATEVER CONFESSION WE BELONG AND WHETHER WE BELIEVE IN THE FUTUREPERFECTION OF OUR RACE OR IN THE NEAREST DATE FIXED FOR THE END OF THEWORLD WHETHER WE REGARD THE EARTH AS A PUTREFYING NIDUS FOR A SAVEDREMNANT INCLUDING OURSELVES OR HAVE A PASSIONATE BELIEF IN THESOLIDARITY OF MANKIND.THE SERVICE HE COULD DO TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION HAD BEEN THROUGH LIFETHE GROUND HE ALLEGED TO HIMSELF FOR HIS CHOICE OF ACTION IT HAD BEENTHE MOTIVE WHICH HE HAD POURED OUT IN HIS PRAYERS. WHO WOULD USE MONEYAND POSITION BETTER THAN HE MEANT TO USE THEM WHO COULD SURPASS HIM INSELFABHORRENCE AND EXALTATION OF GODS CAUSE AND TO MR. BULSTRODEGODS CAUSE WAS SOMETHING DISTINCT FROM HIS OWN RECTITUDE OF CONDUCTIT ENFORCED A DISCRIMINATION OF GODS ENEMIES WHO WERE TO BE USEDMERELY AS INSTRUMENTS AND WHOM IT WOULD BE AS WELL IF POSSIBLE TO KEEPOUT OF MONEY AND CONSEQUENT INFLUENCE. ALSO PROFITABLE INVESTMENTS INTRADES WHERE THE POWER OF THE PRINCE OF THIS WORLD SHOWED ITS MOSTACTIVE DEVICES BECAME SANCTIFIED BY A RIGHT APPLICATION OF THE PROFITSIN THE HANDS OF GODS SERVANT.THIS IMPLICIT REASONING IS ESSENTIALLY NO MORE PECULIAR TO EVANGELICALBELIEF THAN THE USE OF WIDE PHRASES FOR NARROW MOTIVES IS PECULIAR TOENGLISHMEN. THERE IS NO GENERAL DOCTRINE WHICH IS NOT CAPABLE OF EATINGOUT OUR MORALITY IF UNCHECKED BY THE DEEPSEATED HABIT OF DIRECTFELLOWFEELING WITH INDIVIDUAL FELLOWMEN.BUT A MAN WHO BELIEVES IN SOMETHING ELSE THAN HIS OWN GREED HASNECESSARILY A CONSCIENCE OR STANDARD TO WHICH HE MORE OR LESS ADAPTSHIMSELF. BULSTRODES STANDARD HAD BEEN HIS SERVICEABLENESS TO GODSCAUSE I AM SINFUL AND NOUGHTA VESSEL TO BE CONSECRATED BY USEBUTUSE MEHAD BEEN THE MOULD INTO WHICH HE HAD CONSTRAINED HIS IMMENSENEED OF BEING SOMETHING IMPORTANT AND PREDOMINATING. AND NOW HAD COME AMOMENT IN WHICH THAT MOULD SEEMED IN DANGER OF BEING BROKEN AND UTTERLYCAST AWAY.WHAT IF THE ACTS HE HAD RECONCILED HIMSELF TO BECAUSE THEY MADE HIM ASTRONGER INSTRUMENT OF THE DIVINE GLORY WERE TO BECOME THE PRETEXT OFTHE SCOFFER AND A DARKENING OF THAT GLORY IF THIS WERE TO BE THERULING OF PROVIDENCE HE WAS CAST OUT FROM THE TEMPLE AS ONE WHO HADBROUGHT UNCLEAN OFFERINGS.HE HAD LONG POURED OUT UTTERANCES OF REPENTANCE. BUT TODAY A REPENTANCEHAD COME WHICH WAS OF A BITTERER FLAVOR AND A THREATENING PROVIDENCEURGED HIM TO A KIND OF PROPITIATION WHICH WAS NOT SIMPLY A DOCTRINALTRANSACTION. THE DIVINE TRIBUNAL HAD CHANGED ITS ASPECT FOR HIMSELFPROSTRATION WAS NO LONGER ENOUGH AND HE MUST BRING RESTITUTION INHIS HAND. IT WAS REALLY BEFORE HIS GOD THAT BULSTRODE WAS ABOUT TOATTEMPT SUCH RESTITUTION AS SEEMED POSSIBLE A GREAT DREAD HAD SEIZEDHIS SUSCEPTIBLE FRAME AND THE SCORCHING APPROACH OF SHAME WROUGHT INHIM A NEW SPIRITUAL NEED. NIGHT AND DAY WHILE THE RESURGENTTHREATENING PAST WAS MAKING A CONSCIENCE WITHIN HIM HE WAS THINKING BYWHAT MEANS HE COULD RECOVER PEACE AND TRUSTBY WHAT SACRIFICE HE COULDSTAY THE ROD. HIS BELIEF IN THESE MOMENTS OF DREAD WAS THAT IF HESPONTANEOUSLY DID SOMETHING RIGHT GOD WOULD SAVE HIM FROM THECONSEQUENCES OF WRONGDOING. FOR RELIGION CAN ONLY CHANGE WHEN THEEMOTIONS WHICH FILL IT ARE CHANGED AND THE RELIGION OF PERSONAL FEARREMAINS NEARLY AT THE LEVEL OF THE SAVAGE.HE HAD SEEN RAFFLES ACTUALLY GOING AWAY ON THE BRASSING COACH AND THISWAS A TEMPORARY RELIEF IT REMOVED THE PRESSURE OF AN IMMEDIATE DREADBUT DID NOT PUT AN END TO THE SPIRITUAL CONFLICT AND THE NEED TO WINPROTECTION. AT LAST HE CAME TO A DIFFICULT RESOLVE AND WROTE A LETTERTO WILL LADISLAW BEGGING HIM TO BE AT THE SHRUBS THAT EVENING FOR APRIVATE INTERVIEW AT NINE OCLOCK. WILL HAD FELT NO PARTICULAR SURPRISEAT THE REQUEST AND CONNECTED IT WITH SOME NEW NOTIONS ABOUT THEPIONEER BUT WHEN HE WAS SHOWN INTO MR. BULSTRODES PRIVATE ROOM HEWAS STRUCK WITH THE PAINFULLY WORN LOOK ON THE BANKERS FACE AND WASGOING TO SAY ARE YOU ILL WHEN CHECKING HIMSELF IN THAT ABRUPTNESSHE ONLY INQUIRED AFTER MRS. BULSTRODE AND HER SATISFACTION WITH THEPICTURE BOUGHT FOR HER.THANK YOU SHE IS QUITE SATISFIED SHE HAS GONE OUT WITH HER DAUGHTERSTHIS EVENING. I BEGGED YOU TO COME MR. LADISLAW BECAUSE I HAVE ACOMMUNICATION OF A VERY PRIVATEINDEED I WILL SAY OF A SACREDLYCONFIDENTIAL NATURE WHICH I DESIRE TO MAKE TO YOU. NOTHING I DARESAY HAS BEEN FARTHER FROM YOUR THOUGHTS THAN THAT THERE HAD BEENIMPORTANT TIES IN THE PAST WHICH COULD CONNECT YOUR HISTORY WITH MINE.WILL FELT SOMETHING LIKE AN ELECTRIC SHOCK. HE WAS ALREADY IN A STATEOF KEEN SENSITIVENESS AND HARDLY ALLAYED AGITATION ON THE SUBJECT OFTIES IN THE PAST AND HIS PRESENTIMENTS WERE NOT AGREEABLE. IT SEEMEDLIKE THE FLUCTUATIONS OF A DREAMAS IF THE ACTION BEGUN BY THAT LOUDBLOATED STRANGER WERE BEING CARRIED ON BY THIS PALEEYED SICKLY LOOKINGPIECE OF RESPECTABILITY WHOSE SUBDUED TONE AND GLIB FORMALITY OFSPEECH WERE AT THIS MOMENT ALMOST AS REPULSIVE TO HIM AS THEIRREMEMBERED CONTRAST. HE ANSWERED WITH A MARKED CHANGE OF COLORNO INDEED NOTHING.YOU SEE BEFORE YOU MR. LADISLAW A MAN WHO IS DEEPLY STRICKEN. BUTFOR THE URGENCY OF CONSCIENCE AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I AM BEFORE THEBAR OF ONE WHO SEETH NOT AS MAN SEETH I SHOULD BE UNDER NO COMPULSIONTO MAKE THE DISCLOSURE WHICH HAS BEEN MY OBJECT IN ASKING YOU TO COMEHERE TONIGHT. SO FAR AS HUMAN LAWS GO YOU HAVE NO CLAIM ON MEWHATEVER.WILL WAS EVEN MORE UNCOMFORTABLE THAN WONDERING. MR. BULSTRODE HADPAUSED LEANING HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND AND LOOKING AT THE FLOOR. BUT HENOW FIXED HIS EXAMINING GLANCE ON WILL AND SAIDI AM TOLD THAT YOUR MOTHERS NAME WAS SARAH DUNKIRK AND THAT SHE RANAWAY FROM HER FRIENDS TO GO ON THE STAGE. ALSO THAT YOUR FATHER WAS ATONE TIME MUCH EMACIATED BY ILLNESS. MAY I ASK IF YOU CAN CONFIRM THESESTATEMENTSYES THEY ARE ALL TRUE SAID WILL STRUCK WITH THE ORDER IN WHICH ANINQUIRY HAD COME THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO BE PRELIMINARY TOTHE BANKERS PREVIOUS HINTS. BUT MR. BULSTRODE HAD TONIGHT FOLLOWEDTHE ORDER OF HIS EMOTIONS HE ENTERTAINED NO DOUBT THAT THE OPPORTUNITYFOR RESTITUTION HAD COME AND HE HAD AN OVERPOWERING IMPULSE TOWARDSTHE PENITENTIAL EXPRESSION BY WHICH HE WAS DEPRECATING CHASTISEMENT.DO YOU KNOW ANY PARTICULARS OF YOUR MOTHERS FAMILY HE CONTINUED.NO SHE NEVER LIKED TO SPEAK OF THEM. SHE WAS A VERY GENEROUSHONORABLE WOMAN SAID WILL ALMOST ANGRILY.I DO NOT WISH TO ALLEGE ANYTHING AGAINST HER. DID SHE NEVER MENTIONHER MOTHER TO YOU AT ALLI HAVE HEARD HER SAY THAT SHE THOUGHT HER MOTHER DID NOT KNOW THEREASON OF HER RUNNING AWAY. SHE SAID POOR MOTHER IN A PITYING TONE.THAT MOTHER BECAME MY WIFE SAID BULSTRODE AND THEN PAUSED A MOMENTBEFORE HE ADDED YOU HAVE A CLAIM ON ME MR. LADISLAW AS I SAIDBEFORE NOT A LEGAL CLAIM BUT ONE WHICH MY CONSCIENCE RECOGNIZES. IWAS ENRICHED BY THAT MARRIAGEA RESULT WHICH WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVETAKEN PLACECERTAINLY NOT TO THE SAME EXTENTIF YOUR GRANDMOTHER COULDHAVE DISCOVERED HER DAUGHTER. THAT DAUGHTER I GATHER IS NO LONGERLIVINGNO SAID WILL FEELING SUSPICION AND REPUGNANCE RISING SO STRONGLYWITHIN HIM THAT WITHOUT QUITE KNOWING WHAT HE DID HE TOOK HIS HATFROM THE FLOOR AND STOOD UP. THE IMPULSE WITHIN HIM WAS TO REJECT THEDISCLOSED CONNECTION.PRAY BE SEATED MR. LADISLAW SAID BULSTRODE ANXIOUSLY. DOUBTLESSYOU ARE STARTLED BY THE SUDDENNESS OF THIS DISCOVERY. BUT I ENTREATYOUR PATIENCE WITH ONE WHO IS ALREADY BOWED DOWN BY INWARD TRIAL.WILL RESEATED HIMSELF FEELING SOME PITY WHICH WAS HALF CONTEMPT FORTHIS VOLUNTARY SELFABASEMENT OF AN ELDERLY MAN.IT IS MY WISH MR. LADISLAW TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE DEPRIVATION WHICHBEFELL YOUR MOTHER. I KNOW THAT YOU ARE WITHOUT FORTUNE AND I WISH TOSUPPLY YOU ADEQUATELY FROM A STORE WHICH WOULD HAVE PROBABLY ALREADYBEEN YOURS HAD YOUR GRANDMOTHER BEEN CERTAIN OF YOUR MOTHERS EXISTENCEAND BEEN ABLE TO FIND HER.MR. BULSTRODE PAUSED. HE FELT THAT HE WAS PERFORMING A STRIKING PIECEOF SCRUPULOSITY IN THE JUDGMENT OF HIS AUDITOR AND A PENITENTIAL ACTIN THE EYES OF GOD. HE HAD NO CLEW TO THE STATE OF WILL LADISLAWSMIND SMARTING AS IT WAS FROM THE CLEAR HINTS OF RAFFLES AND WITH ITSNATURAL QUICKNESS IN CONSTRUCTION STIMULATED BY THE EXPECTATION OFDISCOVERIES WHICH HE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO CONJURE BACK INTODARKNESS. WILL MADE NO ANSWER FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS TILL MR. BULSTRODEWHO AT THE END OF HIS SPEECH HAD CAST HIS EYES ON THE FLOOR NOW RAISEDTHEM WITH AN EXAMINING GLANCE WHICH WILL MET FULLY SAYINGI SUPPOSE YOU DID KNOW OF MY MOTHERS EXISTENCE AND KNEW WHERE SHEMIGHT HAVE BEEN FOUND.BULSTRODE SHRANKTHERE WAS A VISIBLE QUIVERING IN HIS FACE AND HANDS.HE WAS TOTALLY UNPREPARED TO HAVE HIS ADVANCES MET IN THIS WAY OR TOFIND HIMSELF URGED INTO MORE REVELATION THAN HE HAD BEFOREHAND SET DOWNAS NEEDFUL. BUT AT THAT MOMENT HE DARED NOT TELL A LIE AND HE FELTSUDDENLY UNCERTAIN OF HIS GROUND WHICH HE HAD TRODDEN WITH SOMECONFIDENCE BEFORE.I WILL NOT DENY THAT YOU CONJECTURE RIGHTLY HE ANSWERED WITH AFALTERING IN HIS TONE. AND I WISH TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO YOU AS THE ONESTILL REMAINING WHO HAS SUFFERED A LOSS THROUGH ME. YOU ENTER I TRUSTINTO MY PURPOSE MR. LADISLAW WHICH HAS A REFERENCE TO HIGHER THANMERELY HUMAN CLAIMS AND AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID IS ENTIRELYINDEPENDENT OF ANY LEGAL COMPULSION. I AM READY TO NARROW MY OWNRESOURCES AND THE PROSPECTS OF MY FAMILY BY BINDING MYSELF TO ALLOW YOUFIVE HUNDRED POUNDS YEARLY DURING MY LIFE AND TO LEAVE YOU APROPORTIONAL CAPITAL AT MY DEATHNAY TO DO STILL MORE IF MORE SHOULDBE DEFINITELY NECESSARY TO ANY LAUDABLE PROJECT ON YOUR PART. MR.BULSTRODE HAD GONE ON TO PARTICULARS IN THE EXPECTATION THAT THESEWOULD WORK STRONGLY ON LADISLAW AND MERGE OTHER FEELINGS IN GRATEFULACCEPTANCE.BUT WILL WAS LOOKING AS STUBBORN AS POSSIBLE WITH HIS LIP POUTING ANDHIS FINGERS IN HIS SIDEPOCKETS. HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST TOUCHED ANDSAID FIRMLYBEFORE I MAKE ANY REPLY TO YOUR PROPOSITION MR. BULSTRODE I MUST BEGYOU TO ANSWER A QUESTION OR TWO.

HOW COULD HEREFUSE TO ANSWER WHEN HE HAD VOLUNTEERED WHAT DREW FORTH THE QUESTIONHE ANSWERED YES.AND WAS THAT BUSINESSOR WAS IT NOTA THOROUGHLY DISHONORABLE ONENAYONE THAT IF ITS NATURE HAD BEEN MADE PUBLIC MIGHT HAVE RANKED THOSECONCERNED IN IT WITH THIEVES AND CONVICTSWILLS TONE HAD A CUTTING BITTERNESS HE WAS MOVED TO PUT HIS QUESTIONAS NAKEDLY AS HE COULD.BULSTRODE REDDENED WITH IRREPRESSIBLE ANGER. HE HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR ASCENE OF SELFABASEMENT BUT HIS INTENSE PRIDE AND HIS HABIT OFSUPREMACY OVERPOWERED PENITENCE AND EVEN DREAD WHEN THIS YOUNG MANWHOM HE HAD MEANT TO BENEFIT TURNED ON HIM WITH THE AIR OF A JUDGE.THE BUSINESS WAS ESTABLISHED BEFORE I BECAME CONNECTED WITH IT SIRNOR IS IT FOR YOU TO INSTITUTE AN INQUIRY OF THAT KIND HE ANSWEREDNOT RAISING HIS VOICE BUT SPEAKING WITH QUICK DEFIANTNESS.YES IT IS SAID WILL STARTING UP AGAIN WITH HIS HAT IN HIS HAND.IT IS EMINENTLY MINE TO ASK SUCH QUESTIONS WHEN I HAVE TO DECIDEWHETHER I WILL HAVE TRANSACTIONS WITH YOU AND ACCEPT YOUR MONEY.

IT OUGHT TO LIEWITH A MANS SELF THAT HE IS A GENTLEMAN. GOODNIGHT SIR.BULSTRODE WAS GOING TO SPEAK BUT WILL WITH DETERMINED QUICKNESS WASOUT OF THE ROOM IN AN INSTANT AND IN ANOTHER THE HALLDOOR HAD CLOSEDBEHIND HIM. HE WAS TOO STRONGLY POSSESSED WITH PASSIONATE REBELLIONAGAINST THIS INHERITED BLOT WHICH HAD BEEN THRUST ON HIS KNOWLEDGE TOREFLECT AT PRESENT WHETHER HE HAD NOT BEEN TOO HARD ON BULSTRODETOOARROGANTLY MERCILESS TOWARDS A MAN OF SIXTY WHO WAS MAKING EFFORTS ATRETRIEVAL WHEN TIME HAD RENDERED THEM VAIN.NO THIRD PERSON LISTENING COULD HAVE THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD THEIMPETUOSITY OF WILLS REPULSE OR THE BITTERNESS OF HIS WORDS. NO ONEBUT HIMSELF THEN KNEW HOW EVERYTHING CONNECTED WITH THE SENTIMENT OFHIS OWN DIGNITY HAD AN IMMEDIATE BEARING FOR HIM ON HIS RELATION TODOROTHEA AND TO MR. CASAUBONS TREATMENT OF HIM. AND IN THE RUSH OFIMPULSES BY WHICH HE FLUNG BACK THAT OFFER OF BULSTRODES THERE WASMINGLED THE SENSE THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM EVER TOTELL DOROTHEA THAT HE HAD ACCEPTED IT.AS FOR BULSTRODEWHEN WILL WAS GONE HE SUFFERED A VIOLENT REACTION ANDWEPT LIKE A WOMAN. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD ENCOUNTERED AN OPENEXPRESSION OF SCORN FROM ANY MAN HIGHER THAN RAFFLES AND WITH THATSCORN HURRYING LIKE VENOM THROUGH HIS SYSTEM THERE WAS NO SENSIBILITYLEFT TO CONSOLATIONS. BUT THE RELIEF OF WEEPING HAD TO BE CHECKED. HISWIFE AND DAUGHTERS SOON CAME HOME FROM HEARING THE ADDRESS OF ANORIENTAL MISSIONARY AND WERE FULL OF REGRET THAT PAPA HAD NOT HEARDIN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE INTERESTING THINGS WHICH THEY TRIED TOREPEAT TO HIM.PERHAPS THROUGH ALL OTHER HIDDEN THOUGHTS THE ONE THAT BREATHED MOSTCOMFORT WAS THAT WILL LADISLAW AT LEAST WAS NOT LIKELY TO PUBLISH WHATHAD TAKEN PLACE THAT EVENING.CHAPTER LXII.HE WAS A SQUYER OF LOWE DEGRETHAT LOVED THE KINGS DAUGHTER OF HUNGRIE.OLD ROMANCE.WILL LADISLAWS MIND WAS NOW WHOLLY BENT ON SEEING DOROTHEA AGAIN ANDFORTHWITH QUITTING MIDDLEMARCH. THE MORNING AFTER HIS AGITATING SCENEWITH BULSTRODE HE WROTE A BRIEF LETTER TO HER SAYING THAT VARIOUSCAUSES HAD DETAINED HIM IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD LONGER THAN HE HADEXPECTED AND ASKING HER PERMISSION TO CALL AGAIN AT LOWICK AT SOMEHOUR WHICH SHE WOULD MENTION ON THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DAY HE BEINGANXIOUS TO DEPART BUT UNWILLING TO DO SO UNTIL SHE HAD GRANTED HIM ANINTERVIEW. HE LEFT THE LETTER AT THE OFFICE ORDERING THE MESSENGER TOCARRY IT TO LOWICK MANOR AND WAIT FOR AN ANSWER.LADISLAW FELT THE AWKWARDNESS OF ASKING FOR MORE LAST WORDS. HIS FORMERFAREWELL HAD BEEN MADE IN THE HEARING OF SIR JAMES CHETTAM AND HADBEEN ANNOUNCED AS FINAL EVEN TO THE BUTLER. IT IS CERTAINLY TRYING TO AMANS DIGNITY TO REAPPEAR WHEN HE IS NOT EXPECTED TO DO SO A FIRSTFAREWELL HAS PATHOS IN IT BUT TO COME BACK FOR A SECOND LENDS ANOPENING TO COMEDY AND IT WAS POSSIBLE EVEN THAT THERE MIGHT BE BITTERSNEERS AFLOAT ABOUT WILLS MOTIVES FOR LINGERING. STILL IT WAS ON THEWHOLE MORE SATISFACTORY TO HIS FEELING TO TAKE THE DIRECTEST MEANS OFSEEING DOROTHEA THAN TO USE ANY DEVICE WHICH MIGHT GIVE AN AIR OFCHANCE TO A MEETING OF WHICH HE WISHED HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT WASWHAT HE EARNESTLY SOUGHT. WHEN HE HAD PARTED FROM HER BEFORE HE HADBEEN IN IGNORANCE OF FACTS WHICH GAVE A NEW ASPECT TO THE RELATIONBETWEEN THEM AND MADE A MORE ABSOLUTE SEVERANCE THAN HE HAD THENBELIEVED IN. HE KNEW NOTHING OF DOROTHEAS PRIVATE FORTUNE AND BEINGLITTLE USED TO REFLECT ON SUCH MATTERS TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THATACCORDING TO MR. CASAUBONS ARRANGEMENT MARRIAGE TO HIM WILL LADISLAWWOULD MEAN THAT SHE CONSENTED TO BE PENNILESS. THAT WAS NOT WHAT HECOULD WISH FOR EVEN IN HIS SECRET HEART OR EVEN IF SHE HAD BEEN READYTO MEET SUCH HARD CONTRAST FOR HIS SAKE. AND THEN TOO THERE WAS THEFRESH SMART OF THAT DISCLOSURE ABOUT HIS MOTHERS FAMILY WHICH IFKNOWN WOULD BE AN ADDED REASON WHY DOROTHEAS FRIENDS SHOULD LOOK DOWNUPON HIM AS UTTERLY BELOW HER. THE SECRET HOPE THAT AFTER SOME YEARS HEMIGHT COME BACK WITH THE SENSE THAT HE HAD AT LEAST A PERSONAL VALUEEQUAL TO HER WEALTH SEEMED NOW THE DREAMY CONTINUATION OF A DREAM.THIS CHANGE WOULD SURELY JUSTIFY HIM IN ASKING DOROTHEA TO RECEIVE HIMONCE MORE.BUT DOROTHEA ON THAT MORNING WAS NOT AT HOME TO RECEIVE WILLS NOTE. INCONSEQUENCE OF A LETTER FROM HER UNCLE ANNOUNCING HIS INTENTION TO BEAT HOME IN A WEEK SHE HAD DRIVEN FIRST TO FRESHITT TO CARRY THE NEWSMEANING TO GO ON TO THE GRANGE TO DELIVER SOME ORDERS WITH WHICH HERUNCLE HAD INTRUSTED HERTHINKING AS HE SAID A LITTLE MENTALOCCUPATION OF THIS SORT GOOD FOR A WIDOW.IF WILL LADISLAW COULD HAVE OVERHEARD SOME OF THE TALK AT FRESHITT THATMORNING HE WOULD HAVE FELT ALL HIS SUPPOSITIONS CONFIRMED AS TO THEREADINESS OF CERTAIN PEOPLE TO SNEER AT HIS LINGERING IN THENEIGHBORHOOD. SIR JAMES INDEED THOUGH MUCH RELIEVED CONCERNINGDOROTHEA HAD BEEN ON THE WATCH TO LEARN LADISLAWS MOVEMENTS AND HADAN INSTRUCTED INFORMANT IN MR. STANDISH WHO WAS NECESSARILY IN HISCONFIDENCE ON THIS MATTER. THAT LADISLAW HAD STAYED IN MIDDLEMARCHNEARLY TWO MONTHS AFTER HE HAD DECLARED THAT HE WAS GOING IMMEDIATELYWAS A FACT TO EMBITTER SIR JAMESS SUSPICIONS OR AT LEAST TO JUSTIFYHIS AVERSION TO A YOUNG FELLOW WHOM HE REPRESENTED TO HIMSELF ASSLIGHT VOLATILE AND LIKELY ENOUGH TO SHOW SUCH RECKLESSNESS ASNATURALLY WENT ALONG WITH A POSITION UNRIVETED BY FAMILY TIES OR ASTRICT PROFESSION. BUT HE HAD JUST HEARD SOMETHING FROM STANDISH WHICHWHILE IT JUSTIFIED THESE SURMISES ABOUT WILL OFFERED A MEANS OFNULLIFYING ALL DANGER WITH REGARD TO DOROTHEA.UNWONTED CIRCUMSTANCES MAY MAKE US ALL RATHER UNLIKE OURSELVES THEREARE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE MOST MAJESTIC PERSON IS OBLIGED TOSNEEZE AND OUR EMOTIONS ARE LIABLE TO BE ACTED ON IN THE SAMEINCONGRUOUS MANNER. GOOD SIR JAMES WAS THIS MORNING SO FAR UNLIKEHIMSELF THAT HE WAS IRRITABLY ANXIOUS TO SAY SOMETHING TO DOROTHEA ON ASUBJECT WHICH HE USUALLY AVOIDED AS IF IT HAD BEEN A MATTER OF SHAME TOTHEM BOTH. HE COULD NOT USE CELIA AS A MEDIUM BECAUSE HE DID NOTCHOOSE THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THE KIND OF GOSSIP HE HAD IN HIS MIND ANDBEFORE DOROTHEA HAPPENED TO ARRIVE HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO IMAGINE HOWWITH HIS SHYNESS AND UNREADY TONGUE HE COULD EVER MANAGE TO INTRODUCEHIS COMMUNICATION. HER UNEXPECTED PRESENCE BROUGHT HIM TO UTTERHOPELESSNESS IN HIS OWN POWER OF SAYING ANYTHING UNPLEASANT BUTDESPERATION SUGGESTED A RESOURCE HE SENT THE GROOM ON AN UNSADDLEDHORSE ACROSS THE PARK WITH A PENCILLED NOTE TO MRS. CADWALLADER WHOALREADY KNEW THE GOSSIP AND WOULD THINK IT NO COMPROMISE OF HERSELF TOREPEAT IT AS OFTEN AS REQUIRED.DOROTHEA WAS DETAINED ON THE GOOD PRETEXT THAT MR. GARTH WHOM SHEWANTED TO SEE WAS EXPECTED AT THE HALL WITHIN THE HOUR AND SHE WASSTILL TALKING TO CALEB ON THE GRAVEL WHEN SIR JAMES ON THE WATCH FORTHE RECTORS WIFE SAW HER COMING AND MET HER WITH THE NEEDFUL HINTS.ENOUGH I UNDERSTANDSAID MRS. CADWALLADER. YOU SHALL BE INNOCENT.I AM SUCH A BLACKAMOOR THAT I CANNOT SMIRCH MYSELF.I DONT MEAN THAT ITS OF ANY CONSEQUENCE SAID SIR JAMES DISLIKINGTHAT MRS. CADWALLADER SHOULD UNDERSTAND TOO MUCH. ONLY IT IS DESIRABLETHAT DOROTHEA SHOULD KNOW THERE ARE REASONS WHY SHE SHOULD NOT RECEIVEHIM AGAIN AND I REALLY CANT SAY SO TO HER. IT WILL COME LIGHTLY FROMYOU.IT CAME VERY LIGHTLY INDEED. WHEN DOROTHEA QUITTED CALEB AND TURNED TOMEET THEM IT APPEARED THAT MRS. CADWALLADER HAD STEPPED ACROSS THEPARK BY THE MEREST CHANCE IN THE WORLD JUST TO CHAT WITH CELIA IN AMATRONLY WAY ABOUT THE BABY. AND SO MR. BROOKE WAS COMING BACKDELIGHTFULCOMING BACK IT WAS TO BE HOPED QUITE CURED OFPARLIAMENTARY FEVER AND PIONEERING. APROPOS OF THE PIONEERSOMEBODYHAD PROPHESIED THAT IT WOULD SOON BE LIKE A DYING DOLPHIN AND TURN ALLCOLORS FOR WANT OF KNOWING HOW TO HELP ITSELF BECAUSE MR. BROOKESPROTEGE THE BRILLIANT YOUNG LADISLAW WAS GONE OR GOING. HAD SIR JAMESHEARD THATTHE THREE WERE WALKING ALONG THE GRAVEL SLOWLY AND SIR JAMES TURNINGASIDE TO WHIP A SHRUB SAID HE HAD HEARD SOMETHING OF THAT SORT.ALL FALSE SAID MRS. CADWALLADER. HE IS NOT GONE OR GOINGAPPARENTLY THE PIONEER KEEPS ITS COLOR AND MR. ORLANDO LADISLAW ISMAKING A SAD DARKBLUE SCANDAL BY WARBLING CONTINUALLY WITH YOUR MR.LYDGATES WIFE WHO THEY TELL ME IS AS PRETTY AS PRETTY CAN BE. ITSEEMS NOBODY EVER GOES INTO THE HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING THIS YOUNGGENTLEMAN LYING ON THE RUG OR WARBLING AT THE PIANO. BUT THE PEOPLE INMANUFACTURING TOWNS ARE ALWAYS DISREPUTABLE.YOU BEGAN BY SAYING THAT ONE REPORT WAS FALSE MRS. CADWALLADER AND IBELIEVE THIS IS FALSE TOO SAID DOROTHEA WITH INDIGNANT ENERGY ATLEAST I FEEL SURE IT IS A MISREPRESENTATION. I WILL NOT HEAR ANY EVILSPOKEN OF MR. LADISLAW HE HAS ALREADY SUFFERED TOO MUCH INJUSTICE.DOROTHEA WHEN THOROUGHLY MOVED CARED LITTLE WHAT ANY ONE THOUGHT OF HERFEELINGS AND EVEN IF SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO REFLECT SHE WOULD HAVE HELDIT PETTY TO KEEP SILENCE AT INJURIOUS WORDS ABOUT WILL FROM FEAR OFBEING HERSELF MISUNDERSTOOD. HER FACE WAS FLUSHED AND HER LIP TREMBLED.SIR JAMES GLANCING AT HER REPENTED OF HIS STRATAGEM BUT MRS.CADWALLADER EQUAL TO ALL OCCASIONS SPREAD THE PALMS OF HER HANDSOUTWARD AND SAIDHEAVEN GRANT IT MY DEARI MEAN THAT ALL BAD TALESABOUT ANYBODY MAY BE FALSE. BUT IT IS A PITY THAT YOUNG LYDGATE SHOULDHAVE MARRIED ONE OF THESE MIDDLEMARCH GIRLS. CONSIDERING HES A SON OFSOMEBODY HE MIGHT HAVE GOT A WOMAN WITH GOOD BLOOD IN HER VEINS ANDNOT TOO YOUNG WHO WOULD HAVE PUT UP WITH HIS PROFESSION. THERES CLARAHARFAGER FOR INSTANCE WHOSE FRIENDS DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HERAND SHE HAS A PORTION. THEN WE MIGHT HAVE HAD HER AMONG US.HOWEVERITS NO USE BEING WISE FOR OTHER PEOPLE. WHERE IS CELIA PRAYLET US GO IN.I AM GOING ON IMMEDIATELY TO TIPTON SAID DOROTHEA RATHER HAUGHTILY.GOODBY.SIR JAMES COULD SAY NOTHING AS HE ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE CARRIAGE. HEWAS ALTOGETHER DISCONTENTED WITH THE RESULT OF A CONTRIVANCE WHICH HADCOST HIM SOME SECRET HUMILIATION BEFOREHAND.DOROTHEA DROVE ALONG BETWEEN THE BERRIED HEDGEROWS AND THE SHORNCORNFIELDS NOT SEEING OR HEARING ANYTHING AROUND. THE TEARS CAME ANDROLLED DOWN HER CHEEKS BUT SHE DID NOT KNOW IT. THE WORLD IT SEEMEDWAS TURNING UGLY AND HATEFUL AND THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR HERTRUSTFULNESS. IT IS NOT TRUEIT IS NOT TRUE WAS THE VOICE WITHIN HERTHAT SHE LISTENED TO BUT ALL THE WHILE A REMEMBRANCE TO WHICH THEREHAD ALWAYS CLUNG A VAGUE UNEASINESS WOULD THRUST ITSELF ON HERATTENTIONTHE REMEMBRANCE OF THAT DAY WHEN SHE HAD FOUND WILL LADISLAWWITH MRS. LYDGATE AND HAD HEARD HIS VOICE ACCOMPANIED BY THE PIANO.HE SAID HE WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING THAT I DISAPPROVEDI WISH I COULDHAVE TOLD HIM THAT I DISAPPROVED OF THAT SAID POOR DOROTHEAINWARDLY FEELING A STRANGE ALTERNATION BETWEEN ANGER WITH WILL AND THEPASSIONATE DEFENCE OF HIM. THEY ALL TRY TO BLACKEN HIM BEFORE ME BUTI WILL CARE FOR NO PAIN IF HE IS NOT TO BLAME. I ALWAYS BELIEVED HEWAS GOOD.THESE WERE HER LAST THOUGHTS BEFORE SHE FELT THAT THECARRIAGE WAS PASSING UNDER THE ARCHWAY OF THE LODGEGATE AT THE GRANGEWHEN SHE HURRIEDLY PRESSED HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER FACE AND BEGAN TOTHINK OF HER ERRANDS. THE COACHMAN BEGGED LEAVE TO TAKE OUT THE HORSESFOR HALF AN HOUR AS THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH A SHOE ANDDOROTHEA HAVING THE SENSE THAT SHE WAS GOING TO REST TOOK OFF HERGLOVES AND BONNET WHILE SHE WAS LEANING AGAINST A STATUE IN THEENTRANCEHALL AND TALKING TO THE HOUSEKEEPER. AT LAST SHE SAIDI MUST STAY HERE A LITTLE MRS. KELL. I WILL GO INTO THE LIBRARY ANDWRITE YOU SOME MEMORANDA FROM MY UNCLES LETTER IF YOU WILL OPEN THESHUTTERS FOR ME.THE SHUTTERS ARE OPEN MADAM SAID MRS. KELL FOLLOWING DOROTHEA WHOHAD WALKED ALONG AS SHE SPOKE. MR. LADISLAW IS THERE LOOKING FORSOMETHING.WILL HAD COME TO FETCH A PORTFOLIO OF HIS OWN SKETCHES WHICH HE HADMISSED IN THE ACT OF PACKING HIS MOVABLES AND DID NOT CHOOSE TO LEAVEBEHIND.DOROTHEAS HEART SEEMED TO TURN OVER AS IF IT HAD HAD A BLOW BUT SHEWAS NOT PERCEPTIBLY CHECKED IN TRUTH THE SENSE THAT WILL WAS THEREWAS FOR THE MOMENT ALLSATISFYING TO HER LIKE THE SIGHT OF SOMETHINGPRECIOUS THAT ONE HAS LOST. WHEN SHE REACHED THE DOOR SHE SAID TO MRS.KELLGO IN FIRST AND TELL HIM THAT I AM HERE.WILL HAD FOUND HIS PORTFOLIO AND HAD LAID IT ON THE TABLE AT THE FAREND OF THE ROOM TO TURN OVER THE SKETCHES AND PLEASE HIMSELF BYLOOKING AT THE MEMORABLE PIECE OF ART WHICH HAD A RELATION TO NATURETOO MYSTERIOUS FOR DOROTHEA. HE WAS SMILING AT IT STILL AND SHAKINGTHE SKETCHES INTO ORDER WITH THE THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT FIND A LETTERFROM HER AWAITING HIM AT MIDDLEMARCH WHEN MRS. KELL CLOSE TO HIS ELBOWSAIDMRS. CASAUBON IS COMING IN SIR.WILL TURNED ROUND QUICKLY AND THE NEXT MOMENT DOROTHEA WAS ENTERING.AS MRS. KELL CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER THEY MET EACH WAS LOOKING ATTHE OTHER AND CONSCIOUSNESS WAS OVERFLOWED BY SOMETHING THATSUPPRESSED UTTERANCE. IT WAS NOT CONFUSION THAT KEPT THEM SILENT FORTHEY BOTH FELT THAT PARTING WAS NEAR AND THERE IS NO SHAMEFACEDNESS INA SAD PARTING.SHE MOVED AUTOMATICALLY TOWARDS HER UNCLES CHAIR AGAINST THEWRITINGTABLE AND WILL AFTER DRAWING IT OUT A LITTLE FOR HER WENT AFEW PACES OFF AND STOOD OPPOSITE TO HER.PRAY SIT DOWN SAID DOROTHEA CROSSING HER HANDS ON HER LAP I AMVERY GLAD YOU WERE HERE. WILL THOUGHT THAT HER FACE LOOKED JUST AS ITDID WHEN SHE FIRST SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM IN ROME FOR HER WIDOWS CAPFIXED IN HER BONNET HAD GONE OFF WITH IT AND HE COULD SEE THAT SHEHAD LATELY BEEN SHEDDING TEARS. BUT THE MIXTURE OF ANGER IN HERAGITATION HAD VANISHED AT THE SIGHT OF HIM SHE HAD BEEN USED WHENTHEY WERE FACE TO FACE ALWAYS TO FEEL CONFIDENCE AND THE HAPPY FREEDOMWHICH COMES WITH MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND HOW COULD OTHER PEOPLESWORDS HINDER THAT EFFECT ON A SUDDEN LET THE MUSIC WHICH CAN TAKEPOSSESSION OF OUR FRAME AND FILL THE AIR WITH JOY FOR US SOUND ONCEMOREWHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY THAT WE HEARD IT FOUND FAULT WITH IN ITSABSENCEI HAVE SENT A LETTER TO LOWICK MANOR TODAY ASKING LEAVE TO SEE YOUSAID WILL SEATING HIMSELF OPPOSITE TO HER. I AM GOING AWAYIMMEDIATELY AND I COULD NOT GO WITHOUT SPEAKING TO YOU AGAIN.I THOUGHT WE HAD PARTED WHEN YOU CAME TO LOWICK MANY WEEKS AGOYOUTHOUGHT YOU WERE GOING THEN SAID DOROTHEA HER VOICE TREMBLING ALITTLE.YES BUT I WAS IN IGNORANCE THEN OF THINGS WHICH I KNOW NOWTHINGSWHICH HAVE ALTERED MY FEELINGS ABOUT THE FUTURE. WHEN I SAW YOU BEFOREI WAS DREAMING THAT I MIGHT COME BACK SOME DAY. I DONT THINK I EVERSHALLNOW. WILL PAUSED HERE.YOU WISHED ME TO KNOW THE REASONS SAID DOROTHEA TIMIDLY.YES SAID WILL IMPETUOUSLY SHAKING HIS HEAD BACKWARD AND LOOKINGAWAY FROM HER WITH IRRITATION IN HIS FACE. OF COURSE I MUST WISH IT. IHAVE BEEN GROSSLY INSULTED IN YOUR EYES AND IN THE EYES OF OTHERS.THERE HAS BEEN A MEAN IMPLICATION AGAINST MY CHARACTER. I WISH YOU TOKNOW THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD I HAVE LOWERED MYSELF BYUNDERNO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD I HAVE GIVEN MEN THE CHANCE OF SAYING THAT ISOUGHT MONEY UNDER THE PRETEXT OF SEEKINGSOMETHING ELSE. THERE WAS NONEED OF OTHER SAFEGUARD AGAINST METHE SAFEGUARD OF WEALTH WAS ENOUGH.WILL ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR WITH THE LAST WORD AND WENTHE HARDLY KNEWWHERE BUT IT WAS TO THE PROJECTING WINDOW NEAREST HIM WHICH HAD BEENOPEN AS NOW ABOUT THE SAME SEASON A YEAR AGO WHEN HE AND DOROTHEA HADSTOOD WITHIN IT AND TALKED TOGETHER. HER WHOLE HEART WAS GOING OUT ATTHIS MOMENT IN SYMPATHY WITH WILLS INDIGNATION SHE ONLY WANTED TOCONVINCE HIM THAT SHE HAD NEVER DONE HIM INJUSTICE AND HE SEEMED TOHAVE TURNED AWAY FROM HER AS IF SHE TOO HAD BEEN PART OF THE UNFRIENDLYWORLD.IT WOULD BE VERY UNKIND OF YOU TO SUPPOSE THAT I EVER ATTRIBUTED ANYMEANNESS TO YOU SHE BEGAN. THEN IN HER ARDENT WAY WANTING TO PLEADWITH HIM SHE MOVED FROM HER CHAIR AND WENT IN FRONT OF HIM TO HER OLDPLACE IN THE WINDOW SAYING DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT I EVER DISBELIEVED INYOUWHEN WILL SAW HER THERE HE GAVE A START AND MOVED BACKWARD OUT OF THEWINDOW WITHOUT MEETING HER GLANCE. DOROTHEA WAS HURT BY THIS MOVEMENTFOLLOWING UP THE PREVIOUS ANGER OF HIS TONE. SHE WAS READY TO SAY THATIT WAS AS HARD ON HER AS ON HIM AND THAT SHE WAS HELPLESS BUT THOSESTRANGE PARTICULARS OF THEIR RELATION WHICH NEITHER OF THEM COULDEXPLICITLY MENTION KEPT HER ALWAYS IN DREAD OF SAYING TOO MUCH. AT THISMOMENT SHE HAD NO BELIEF THAT WILL WOULD IN ANY CASE HAVE WANTED TOMARRY HER AND SHE FEARED USING WORDS WHICH MIGHT IMPLY SUCH A BELIEF.SHE ONLY SAID EARNESTLY RECURRING TO HIS LAST WORDI AM SURE NO SAFEGUARD WAS EVER NEEDED AGAINST YOU.WILL DID NOT ANSWER. IN THE STORMY FLUCTUATION OF HIS FEELINGS THESEWORDS OF HERS SEEMED TO HIM CRUELLY NEUTRAL AND HE LOOKED PALE ANDMISERABLE AFTER HIS ANGRY OUTBURST. HE WENT TO THE TABLE AND FASTENEDUP HIS PORTFOLIO WHILE DOROTHEA LOOKED AT HIM FROM THE DISTANCE. THEYWERE WASTING THESE LAST MOMENTS TOGETHER IN WRETCHED SILENCE. WHATCOULD HE SAY SINCE WHAT HAD GOT OBSTINATELY UPPERMOST IN HIS MIND WASTHE PASSIONATE LOVE FOR HER WHICH HE FORBADE HIMSELF TO UTTER WHATCOULD SHE SAY SINCE SHE MIGHT OFFER HIM NO HELPSINCE SHE WAS FORCEDTO KEEP THE MONEY THAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HISSINCE TODAY HE SEEMEDNOT TO RESPOND AS HE USED TO DO TO HER THOROUGH TRUST AND LIKINGBUT WILL AT LAST TURNED AWAY FROM HIS PORTFOLIO AND APPROACHED THEWINDOW AGAIN.I MUST GO HE SAID WITH THAT PECULIAR LOOK OF THE EYES WHICHSOMETIMES ACCOMPANIES BITTER FEELING AS IF THEY HAD BEEN TIRED ANDBURNED WITH GAZING TOO CLOSE AT A LIGHT.WHAT SHALL YOU DO IN LIFE SAID DOROTHEA TIMIDLY. HAVE YOURINTENTIONS REMAINED JUST THE SAME AS WHEN WE SAID GOODBY BEFOREYES SAID WILL IN A TONE THAT SEEMED TO WAIVE THE SUBJECT ASUNINTERESTING. I SHALL WORK AWAY AT THE FIRST THING THAT OFFERS. ISUPPOSE ONE GETS A HABIT OF DOING WITHOUT HAPPINESS OR HOPE.OH WHAT SAD WORDS SAID DOROTHEA WITH A DANGEROUS TENDENCY TO SOB.THEN TRYING TO SMILE SHE ADDED WE USED TO AGREE THAT WE WERE ALIKEIN SPEAKING TOO STRONGLY.I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TOO STRONGLY NOW SAID WILL LEANING BACK AGAINSTTHE ANGLE OF THE WALL. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WHICH A MAN CAN ONLYGO THROUGH ONCE IN HIS LIFE AND HE MUST KNOW SOME TIME OR OTHER THATTHE BEST IS OVER WITH HIM. THIS EXPERIENCE HAS HAPPENED TO ME WHILE IAM VERY YOUNGTHAT IS ALL. WHAT I CARE MORE FOR THAN I CAN EVER CAREFOR ANYTHING ELSE IS ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN TO MEI DONT MEAN MERELY BYBEING OUT OF MY REACH BUT FORBIDDEN ME EVEN IF IT WERE WITHIN MYREACH BY MY OWN PRIDE AND HONORBY EVERYTHING I RESPECT MYSELF FOR. OFCOURSE I SHALL GO ON LIVING AS A MAN MIGHT DO WHO HAD SEEN HEAVEN IN ATRANCE.WILL PAUSED IMAGINING THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR DOROTHEA TOMISUNDERSTAND THIS INDEED HE FELT THAT HE WAS CONTRADICTING HIMSELFAND OFFENDING AGAINST HIS SELFAPPROVAL IN SPEAKING TO HER SO PLAINLYBUT STILLIT COULD NOT BE FAIRLY CALLED WOOING A WOMAN TO TELL HER THATHE WOULD NEVER WOO HER. IT MUST BE ADMITTED TO BE A GHOSTLY KIND OFWOOING.BUT DOROTHEAS MIND WAS RAPIDLY GOING OVER THE PAST WITH QUITE ANOTHERVISION THAN HIS. THE THOUGHT THAT SHE HERSELF MIGHT BE WHAT WILL MOSTCARED FOR DID THROB THROUGH HER AN INSTANT BUT THEN CAME DOUBT THEMEMORY OF THE LITTLE THEY HAD LIVED THROUGH TOGETHER TURNED PALE ANDSHRANK BEFORE THE MEMORY WHICH SUGGESTED HOW MUCH FULLER MIGHT HAVEBEEN THE INTERCOURSE BETWEEN WILL AND SOME ONE ELSE WITH WHOM HE HADHAD CONSTANT COMPANIONSHIP. EVERYTHING HE HAD SAID MIGHT REFER TO THATOTHER RELATION AND WHATEVER HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND HERSELF WASTHOROUGHLY EXPLAINED BY WHAT SHE HAD ALWAYS REGARDED AS THEIR SIMPLEFRIENDSHIP AND THE CRUEL OBSTRUCTION THRUST UPON IT BY HER HUSBANDSINJURIOUS ACT. DOROTHEA STOOD SILENT WITH HER EYES CAST DOWN DREAMILYWHILE IMAGES CROWDED UPON HER WHICH LEFT THE SICKENING CERTAINTY THATWILL WAS REFERRING TO MRS. LYDGATE. BUT WHY SICKENING HE WANTED HER TOKNOW THAT HERE TOO HIS CONDUCT SHOULD BE ABOVE SUSPICION.WILL WAS NOT SURPRISED AT HER SILENCE. HIS MIND ALSO WAS TUMULTUOUSLYBUSY WHILE HE WATCHED HER AND HE WAS FEELING RATHER WILDLY THATSOMETHING MUST HAPPEN TO HINDER THEIR PARTINGSOME MIRACLE CLEARLYNOTHING IN THEIR OWN DELIBERATE SPEECH. YET AFTER ALL HAD SHE ANYLOVE FOR HIMHE COULD NOT PRETEND TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD RATHERBELIEVE HER TO BE WITHOUT THAT PAIN. HE COULD NOT DENY THAT A SECRETLONGING FOR THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE LOVED HIM WAS AT THE ROOT OF ALL HISWORDS.NEITHER OF THEM KNEW HOW LONG THEY STOOD IN THAT WAY. DOROTHEA WASRAISING HER EYES AND WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND HERFOOTMAN CAME TO SAYTHE HORSES ARE READY MADAM WHENEVER YOU LIKE TO START.PRESENTLY SAID DOROTHEA. THEN TURNING TO WILL SHE SAID I HAVESOME MEMORANDA TO WRITE FOR THE HOUSEKEEPER.I MUST GO SAID WILL WHEN THE DOOR HAD CLOSED AGAINADVANCINGTOWARDS HER. THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW I SHALL LEAVE MIDDLEMARCH.YOU HAVE ACTED IN EVERY WAY RIGHTLY SAID DOROTHEA IN A LOW TONEFEELING A PRESSURE AT HER HEART WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT TO SPEAK.SHE PUT OUT HER HAND AND WILL TOOK IT FOR AN INSTANT WITHOUT SPEAKINGFOR HER WORDS HAD SEEMED TO HIM CRUELLY COLD AND UNLIKE HERSELF. THEIREYES MET BUT THERE WAS DISCONTENT IN HIS AND IN HERS THERE WAS ONLYSADNESS. HE TURNED AWAY AND TOOK HIS PORTFOLIO UNDER HIS ARM.I HAVE NEVER DONE YOU INJUSTICE. PLEASE REMEMBER ME SAID DOROTHEAREPRESSING A RISING SOB.WHY SHOULD YOU SAY THAT SAID WILL WITH IRRITATION. AS IF I WERENOT IN DANGER OF FORGETTING EVERYTHING ELSE.HE HAD REALLY A MOVEMENT OF ANGER AGAINST HER AT THAT MOMENT AND ITIMPELLED HIM TO GO AWAY WITHOUT PAUSE. IT WAS ALL ONE FLASH TODOROTHEAHIS LAST WORDSHIS DISTANT BOW TO HER AS HE REACHED THEDOORTHE SENSE THAT HE WAS NO LONGER THERE. SHE SANK INTO THE CHAIRAND FOR A FEW MOMENTS SAT LIKE A STATUE WHILE IMAGES AND EMOTIONS WEREHURRYING UPON HER. JOY CAME FIRST IN SPITE OF THE THREATENING TRAINBEHIND ITJOY IN THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS REALLY HERSELF WHOM WILLLOVED AND WAS RENOUNCING THAT THERE WAS REALLY NO OTHER LOVE LESSPERMISSIBLE MORE BLAMEWORTHY WHICH HONOR WAS HURRYING HIM AWAY FROM.THEY WERE PARTED ALL THE SAME BUTDOROTHEA DREW A DEEP BREATH AND FELTHER STRENGTH RETURNSHE COULD THINK OF HIM UNRESTRAINEDLY. AT THATMOMENT THE PARTING WAS EASY TO BEAR THE FIRST SENSE OF LOVING ANDBEING LOVED EXCLUDED SORROW. IT WAS AS IF SOME HARD ICY PRESSURE HADMELTED AND HER CONSCIOUSNESS HAD ROOM TO EXPAND HER PAST WAS COMEBACK TO HER WITH LARGER INTERPRETATION. THE JOY WAS NOT THELESSPERHAPS IT WAS THE MORE COMPLETE JUST THENBECAUSE OF THEIRREVOCABLE PARTING FOR THERE WAS NO REPROACH NO CONTEMPTUOUS WONDERTO IMAGINE IN ANY EYE OR FROM ANY LIPS. HE HAD ACTED SO AS TO DEFYREPROACH AND MAKE WONDER RESPECTFUL.ANY ONE WATCHING HER MIGHT HAVE SEEN THAT THERE WAS A FORTIFYINGTHOUGHT WITHIN HER. JUST AS WHEN INVENTIVE POWER IS WORKING WITH GLADEASE SOME SMALL CLAIM ON THE ATTENTION IS FULLY MET AS IF IT WERE ONLYA CRANNY OPENED TO THE SUNLIGHT IT WAS EASY NOW FOR DOROTHEA TO WRITEHER MEMORANDA. SHE SPOKE HER LAST WORDS TO THE HOUSEKEEPER IN CHEERFULTONES AND WHEN SHE SEATED HERSELF IN THE CARRIAGE HER EYES WERE BRIGHTAND HER CHEEKS BLOOMING UNDER THE DISMAL BONNET. SHE THREW BACK THEHEAVY WEEPERS AND LOOKED BEFORE HER WONDERING WHICH ROAD WILL HADTAKEN. IT WAS IN HER NATURE TO BE PROUD THAT HE WAS BLAMELESS ANDTHROUGH ALL HER FEELINGS THERE RAN THIS VEINI WAS RIGHT TO DEFENDHIM.THE COACHMAN WAS USED TO DRIVE HIS GRAYS AT A GOOD PACE MR. CASAUBONBEING UNENJOYING AND IMPATIENT IN EVERYTHING AWAY FROM HIS DESK ANDWANTING TO GET TO THE END OF ALL JOURNEYS AND DOROTHEA WAS NOW BOWLEDALONG QUICKLY. DRIVING WAS PLEASANT FOR RAIN IN THE NIGHT HAD LAID THEDUST AND THE BLUE SKY LOOKED FAR OFF AWAY FROM THE REGION OF THEGREAT CLOUDS THAT SAILED IN MASSES. THE EARTH LOOKED LIKE A HAPPY PLACEUNDER THE VAST HEAVENS AND DOROTHEA WAS WISHING THAT SHE MIGHTOVERTAKE WILL AND SEE HIM ONCE MORE.AFTER A TURN OF THE ROAD THERE HE WAS WITH THE PORTFOLIO UNDER HISARM BUT THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS PASSING HIM WHILE HE RAISED HIS HATAND SHE FELT A PANG AT BEING SEATED THERE IN A SORT OF EXALTATIONLEAVING HIM BEHIND. SHE COULD NOT LOOK BACK AT HIM. IT WAS AS IF ACROWD OF INDIFFERENT OBJECTS HAD THRUST THEM ASUNDER AND FORCED THEMALONG DIFFERENT PATHS TAKING THEM FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM EACHOTHER AND MAKING IT USELESS TO LOOK BACK. SHE COULD NO MORE MAKE ANYSIGN THAT WOULD SEEM TO SAY NEED WE PART THAN SHE COULD STOP THECARRIAGE TO WAIT FOR HIM. NAY WHAT A WORLD OF REASONS CROWDED UPON HERAGAINST ANY MOVEMENT OF HER THOUGHT TOWARDS A FUTURE THAT MIGHT REVERSETHE DECISION OF THIS DAYI ONLY WISH I HAD KNOWN BEFOREI WISH HE KNEWTHEN WE COULD BE QUITEHAPPY IN THINKING OF EACH OTHER THOUGH WE ARE FOREVER PARTED. AND IF ICOULD BUT HAVE GIVEN HIM THE MONEY AND MADE THINGS EASIER FORHIMWERE THE LONGINGS THAT CAME BACK THE MOST PERSISTENTLY. AND YETSO HEAVILY DID THE WORLD WEIGH ON HER IN SPITE OF HER INDEPENDENTENERGY THAT WITH THIS IDEA OF WILL AS IN NEED OF SUCH HELP AND AT ADISADVANTAGE WITH THE WORLD THERE CAME ALWAYS THE VISION OF THATUNFITTINGNESS OF ANY CLOSER RELATION BETWEEN THEM WHICH LAY IN THEOPINION OF EVERY ONE CONNECTED WITH HER. SHE FELT TO THE FULL ALL THEIMPERATIVENESS OF THE MOTIVES WHICH URGED WILLS CONDUCT. HOW COULD HEDREAM OF HER DEFYING THE BARRIER THAT HER HUSBAND HAD PLACED BETWEENTHEMHOW COULD SHE EVER SAY TO HERSELF THAT SHE WOULD DEFY ITWILLS CERTAINTY AS THE CARRIAGE GREW SMALLER IN THE DISTANCE HAD MUCHMORE BITTERNESS IN IT. VERY SLIGHT MATTERS WERE ENOUGH TO GALL HIM INHIS SENSITIVE MOOD AND THE SIGHT OF DOROTHEA DRIVING PAST HIM WHILE HEFELT HIMSELF PLODDING ALONG AS A POOR DEVIL SEEKING A POSITION IN AWORLD WHICH IN HIS PRESENT TEMPER OFFERED HIM LITTLE THAT HE COVETEDMADE HIS CONDUCT SEEM A MERE MATTER OF NECESSITY AND TOOK AWAY THESUSTAINMENT OF RESOLVE. AFTER ALL HE HAD NO ASSURANCE THAT SHE LOVEDHIM COULD ANY MAN PRETEND THAT HE WAS SIMPLY GLAD IN SUCH A CASE TOHAVE THE SUFFERING ALL ON HIS OWN SIDETHAT EVENING WILL SPENT WITH THE LYDGATES THE NEXT EVENING HE WASGONE.BOOK VII.TWO TEMPTATIONS.CHAPTER LXIII.THESE LITTLE THINGS ARE GREAT TO LITTLE MAN.GOLDSMITH.HAVE YOU SEEN MUCH OF YOUR SCIENTIFIC PHOENIX LYDGATE LATELY SAIDMR.

ONE EVENING WHEN HE TOOK THE PAINS TOGO TO MIDDLEMARCH ON PURPOSE TO HAVE A CHAT WITH LYDGATE AS OF OLD HENOTICED IN HIM AN AIR OF EXCITED EFFORT QUITE UNLIKE HIS USUAL EASY WAYOF KEEPING SILENCE OR BREAKING IT WITH ABRUPT ENERGY WHENEVER HE HADANYTHING TO SAY. LYDGATE TALKED PERSISTENTLY WHEN THEY WERE IN HISWORKROOM PUTTING ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST THE PROBABILITY OF CERTAINBIOLOGICAL VIEWS BUT HE HAD NONE OF THOSE DEFINITE THINGS TO SAY OR TOSHOW WHICH GIVE THE WAYMARKS OF A PATIENT UNINTERRUPTED PURSUIT SUCHAS HE USED HIMSELF TO INSIST ON SAYING THAT THERE MUST BE A SYSTOLEAND DIASTOLE IN ALL INQUIRY AND THAT A MANS MIND MUST BECONTINUALLY EXPANDING AND SHRINKING BETWEEN THE WHOLE HUMAN HORIZON ANDTHE HORIZON OF AN OBJECTGLASS. THAT EVENING HE SEEMED TO BE TALKINGWIDELY FOR THE SAKE OF RESISTING ANY PERSONAL BEARING AND BEFORE LONGTHEY WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE LYDGATE HAVING ASKED ROSAMONDTO GIVE THEM MUSIC SANK BACK IN HIS CHAIR IN SILENCE BUT WITH ASTRANGE LIGHT IN HIS EYES. HE MAY HAVE BEEN TAKING AN OPIATE WAS ATHOUGHT THAT CROSSED MR. FAREBROTHERS MINDTICDOULOUREUX PERHAPSORMEDICAL WORRIES.IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM THAT LYDGATES MARRIAGE WAS NOT DELIGHTFUL HEBELIEVED AS THE REST DID THAT ROSAMOND WAS AN AMIABLE DOCILECREATURE THOUGH HE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT HER RATHER UNINTERESTINGALITTLE TOO MUCH THE PATTERNCARD OF THE FINISHINGSCHOOL AND HISMOTHER COULD NOT FORGIVE ROSAMOND BECAUSE SHE NEVER SEEMED TO SEE THATHENRIETTA NOBLE WAS IN THE ROOM. HOWEVER LYDGATE FELL IN LOVE WITHHER SAID THE VICAR TO HIMSELF AND SHE MUST BE TO HIS TASTE.MR. FAREBROTHER WAS AWARE THAT LYDGATE WAS A PROUD MAN BUT HAVING VERYLITTLE CORRESPONDING FIBRE IN HIMSELF AND PERHAPS TOO LITTLE CAREABOUT PERSONAL DIGNITY EXCEPT THE DIGNITY OF NOT BEING MEAN ORFOOLISH HE COULD HARDLY ALLOW ENOUGH FOR THE WAY IN WHICH LYDGATESHRANK AS FROM A BURN FROM THE UTTERANCE OF ANY WORD ABOUT HISPRIVATE AFFAIRS. AND SOON AFTER THAT CONVERSATION AT MR. TOLLERS THEVICAR LEARNED SOMETHING WHICH MADE HIM WATCH THE MORE EAGERLY FOR ANOPPORTUNITY OF INDIRECTLY LETTING LYDGATE KNOW THAT IF HE WANTED TOOPEN HIMSELF ABOUT ANY DIFFICULTY THERE WAS A FRIENDLY EAR READY.THE OPPORTUNITY CAME AT MR. VINCYS WHERE ON NEW YEARS DAY THEREWAS A PARTY TO WHICH MR. FAREBROTHER WAS IRRESISTIBLY INVITED ON THEPLEA THAT HE MUST NOT FORSAKE HIS OLD FRIENDS ON THE FIRST NEW YEAR OFHIS BEING A GREATER MAN AND RECTOR AS WELL AS VICAR. AND THIS PARTYWAS THOROUGHLY FRIENDLY ALL THE LADIES OF THE FAREBROTHER FAMILY WEREPRESENT THE VINCY CHILDREN ALL DINED AT THE TABLE AND FRED HADPERSUADED HIS MOTHER THAT IF SHE DID NOT INVITE MARY GARTH THEFAREBROTHERS WOULD REGARD IT AS A SLIGHT TO THEMSELVES MARY BEINGTHEIR PARTICULAR FRIEND. MARY CAME AND FRED WAS IN HIGH SPIRITSTHOUGH HIS ENJOYMENT WAS OF A CHECKERED KINDTRIUMPH THAT HIS MOTHERSHOULD SEE MARYS IMPORTANCE WITH THE CHIEF PERSONAGES IN THE PARTYBEING MUCH STREAKED WITH JEALOUSY WHEN MR. FAREBROTHER SAT DOWN BY HER.FRED USED TO BE MUCH MORE EASY ABOUT HIS OWN ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THEDAYS WHEN HE HAD NOT BEGUN TO DREAD BEING BOWLED OUT BY FAREBROTHERAND THIS TERROR WAS STILL BEFORE HIM. MRS. VINCY IN HER FULLESTMATRONLY BLOOM LOOKED AT MARYS LITTLE FIGURE ROUGH WAVY HAIR ANDVISAGE QUITE WITHOUT LILIES AND ROSES AND WONDERED TRYINGUNSUCCESSFULLY TO FANCY HERSELF CARING ABOUT MARYS APPEARANCE INWEDDING CLOTHES OR FEELING COMPLACENCY IN GRANDCHILDREN WHO WOULDFEATURE THE GARTHS. HOWEVER THE PARTY WAS A MERRY ONE AND MARY WASPARTICULARLY BRIGHT BEING GLAD FOR FREDS SAKE THAT HIS FRIENDS WEREGETTING KINDER TO HER AND BEING ALSO QUITE WILLING THAT THEY SHOULDSEE HOW MUCH SHE WAS VALUED BY OTHERS WHOM THEY MUST ADMIT TO BEJUDGES.MR. FAREBROTHER NOTICED THAT LYDGATE SEEMED BORED AND THAT MR. VINCYSPOKE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE TO HIS SONINLAW. ROSAMOND WAS PERFECTLYGRACEFUL AND CALM AND ONLY A SUBTLE OBSERVATION SUCH AS THE VICAR HADNOT BEEN ROUSED TO BESTOW ON HER WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED THE TOTAL ABSENCEOF THAT INTEREST IN HER HUSBANDS PRESENCE WHICH A LOVING WIFE IS SURETO BETRAY EVEN IF ETIQUETTE KEEPS HER ALOOF FROM HIM. WHEN LYDGATE WASTAKING PART IN THE CONVERSATION SHE NEVER LOOKED TOWARDS HIM ANY MORETHAN IF SHE HAD BEEN A SCULPTURED PSYCHE MODELLED TO LOOK ANOTHER WAYAND WHEN AFTER BEING CALLED OUT FOR AN HOUR OR TWO HE REENTERED THEROOM SHE SEEMED UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FACT WHICH EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEFOREWOULD HAVE HAD THE EFFECT OF A NUMERAL BEFORE CIPHERS. IN REALITYHOWEVER SHE WAS INTENSELY AWARE OF LYDGATES VOICE AND MOVEMENTS ANDHER PRETTY GOODTEMPERED AIR OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS WAS A STUDIED NEGATIONBY WHICH SHE SATISFIED HER INWARD OPPOSITION TO HIM WITHOUT COMPROMISEOF PROPRIETY. WHEN THE LADIES WERE IN THE DRAWINGROOM AFTER LYDGATEHAD BEEN CALLED AWAY FROM THE DESSERT MRS. FAREBROTHER WHEN ROSAMONDHAPPENED TO BE NEAR HER SAIDYOU HAVE TO GIVE UP A GREAT DEAL OF YOURHUSBANDS SOCIETY MRS. LYDGATE.YES THE LIFE OF A MEDICAL MAN IS VERY ARDUOUS ESPECIALLY WHEN HE ISSO DEVOTED TO HIS PROFESSION AS MR. LYDGATE IS SAID ROSAMOND WHO WASSTANDING AND MOVED EASILY AWAY AT THE END OF THIS CORRECT LITTLESPEECH.IT IS DREADFULLY DULL FOR HER WHEN THERE IS NO COMPANY SAID MRS.VINCY WHO WAS SEATED AT THE OLD LADYS SIDE. I AM SURE I THOUGHT SOWHEN ROSAMOND WAS ILL AND I WAS STAYING WITH HER. YOU KNOW MRS.FAREBROTHER OURS IS A CHEERFUL HOUSE. I AM OF A CHEERFUL DISPOSITIONMYSELF AND MR. VINCY ALWAYS LIKES SOMETHING TO BE GOING ON. THAT ISWHAT ROSAMOND HAS BEEN USED TO. VERY DIFFERENT FROM A HUSBAND OUT ATODD HOURS AND NEVER KNOWING WHEN HE WILL COME HOME AND OF A CLOSEPROUD DISPOSITION I THINKINDISCREET MRS. VINCY DID LOWER HER TONESLIGHTLY WITH THIS PARENTHESIS. BUT ROSAMOND ALWAYS HAD AN ANGEL OF ATEMPER HER BROTHERS USED VERY OFTEN NOT TO PLEASE HER BUT SHE WASNEVER THE GIRL TO SHOW TEMPER FROM A BABY SHE WAS ALWAYS AS GOOD ASGOOD AND WITH A COMPLEXION BEYOND ANYTHING. BUT MY CHILDREN ARE ALLGOODTEMPERED THANK GOD.THIS WAS EASILY CREDIBLE TO ANY ONE LOOKING AT MRS. VINCY AS SHE THREWBACK HER BROAD CAPSTRINGS AND SMILED TOWARDS HER THREE LITTLE GIRLSAGED FROM SEVEN TO ELEVEN. BUT IN THAT SMILING GLANCE SHE WAS OBLIGEDTO INCLUDE MARY GARTH WHOM THE THREE GIRLS HAD GOT INTO A CORNER TOMAKE HER TELL THEM STORIES. MARY WAS JUST FINISHING THE DELICIOUS TALEOF RUMPELSTILTSKIN WHICH SHE HAD WELL BY HEART BECAUSE LETTY WASNEVER TIRED OF COMMUNICATING IT TO HER IGNORANT ELDERS FROM A FAVORITERED VOLUME. LOUISA MRS. VINCYS DARLING NOW RAN TO HER WITH WIDEEYEDSERIOUS EXCITEMENT CRYING OH MAMMA MAMMA THE LITTLE MAN STAMPED SOHARD ON THE FLOOR HE COULDNT GET HIS LEG OUT AGAINBLESS YOU MY CHERUB SAID MAMMA YOU SHALL TELL ME ALL ABOUT ITTOMORROW. GO AND LISTEN AND THEN AS HER EYES FOLLOWED LOUISA BACKTOWARDS THE ATTRACTIVE CORNER SHE THOUGHT THAT IF FRED WISHED HER TOINVITE MARY AGAIN SHE WOULD MAKE NO OBJECTION THE CHILDREN BEING SOPLEASED WITH HER.BUT PRESENTLY THE CORNER BECAME STILL MORE ANIMATED FOR MR.FAREBROTHER CAME IN AND SEATING HIMSELF BEHIND LOUISA TOOK HER ON HISLAP WHEREUPON THE GIRLS ALL INSISTED THAT HE MUST HEARRUMPELSTILTSKIN AND MARY MUST TELL IT OVER AGAIN. HE INSISTED TOO ANDMARY WITHOUT FUSS BEGAN AGAIN IN HER NEAT FASHION WITH PRECISELY THESAME WORDS AS BEFORE. FRED WHO HAD ALSO SEATED HIMSELF NEAR WOULDHAVE FELT UNMIXED TRIUMPH IN MARYS EFFECTIVENESS IF MR. FAREBROTHERHAD NOT BEEN LOOKING AT HER WITH EVIDENT ADMIRATION WHILE HEDRAMATIZED AN INTENSE INTEREST IN THE TALE TO PLEASE THE CHILDREN.YOU WILL NEVER CARE ANY MORE ABOUT MY ONEEYED GIANT LOO SAID FREDAT THE END.YES I SHALL. TELL ABOUT HIM NOW SAID LOUISA.OH I DARE SAY I AM QUITE CUT OUT. ASK MR. FAREBROTHER.YES ADDED MARY ASK MR. FAREBROTHER TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE ANTSWHOSE BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WAS KNOCKED DOWN BY A GIANT NAMED TOM AND HETHOUGHT THEY DIDNT MIND BECAUSE HE COULDNT HEAR THEM CRY OR SEE THEMUSE THEIR POCKETHANDKERCHIEFS.PLEASE SAID LOUISA LOOKING UP AT THE VICAR.NO NO I AM A GRAVE OLD PARSON. IF I TRY TO DRAW A STORY OUT OF MYBAG A SERMON COMES INSTEAD. SHALL I PREACH YOU A SERMON SAID HEPUTTING ON HIS SHORTSIGHTED GLASSES AND PURSING UP HIS LIPS.YES SAID LOUISA FALTERINGLY.LET ME SEE THEN. AGAINST CAKES HOW CAKES ARE BAD THINGS ESPECIALLYIF THEY ARE SWEET AND HAVE PLUMS IN THEM.LOUISA TOOK THE AFFAIR RATHER SERIOUSLY AND GOT DOWN FROM THE VICARSKNEE TO GO TO FRED.AH I SEE IT WILL NOT DO TO PREACH ON NEW YEARS DAY SAID MR.FAREBROTHER RISING AND WALKING AWAY. HE HAD DISCOVERED OF LATE THATFRED HAD BECOME JEALOUS OF HIM AND ALSO THAT HE HIMSELF WAS NOT LOSINGHIS PREFERENCE FOR MARY ABOVE ALL OTHER WOMEN.A DELIGHTFUL YOUNG PERSON IS MISS GARTH SAID MRS. FAREBROTHER WHOHAD BEEN WATCHING HER SONS MOVEMENTS.YES SAID MRS. VINCY OBLIGED TO REPLY AS THE OLD LADY TURNED TO HEREXPECTANTLY. IT IS A PITY SHE IS NOT BETTERLOOKING.I CANNOT SAY THAT SAID MRS. FAREBROTHER DECISIVELY. I LIKE HERCOUNTENANCE. WE MUST NOT ALWAYS ASK FOR BEAUTY WHEN A GOOD GOD HASSEEN FIT TO MAKE AN EXCELLENT YOUNG WOMAN WITHOUT IT. I PUT GOODMANNERS FIRST AND MISS GARTH WILL KNOW HOW TO CONDUCT HERSELF IN ANYSTATION.THE OLD LADY WAS A LITTLE SHARP IN HER TONE HAVING A PROSPECTIVEREFERENCE TO MARYS BECOMING HER DAUGHTERINLAW FOR THERE WAS THISINCONVENIENCE IN MARYS POSITION WITH REGARD TO FRED THAT IT WAS NOTSUITABLE TO BE MADE PUBLIC AND HENCE THE THREE LADIES AT LOWICKPARSONAGE WERE STILL HOPING THAT CAMDEN WOULD CHOOSE MISS GARTH.NEW VISITORS ENTERED AND THE DRAWINGROOM WAS GIVEN UP TO MUSIC ANDGAMES WHILE WHISTTABLES WERE PREPARED IN THE QUIET ROOM ON THE OTHERSIDE OF THE HALL. MR. FAREBROTHER PLAYED A RUBBER TO SATISFY HISMOTHER WHO REGARDED HER OCCASIONAL WHIST AS A PROTEST AGAINST SCANDALAND NOVELTY OF OPINION IN WHICH LIGHT EVEN A REVOKE HAD ITS DIGNITY.BUT AT THE END HE GOT MR. CHICHELY TO TAKE HIS PLACE AND LEFT THEROOM. AS HE CROSSED THE HALL LYDGATE HAD JUST COME IN AND WAS TAKINGOFF HIS GREATCOAT.YOU ARE THE MAN I WAS GOING TO LOOK FOR SAID THE VICAR AND INSTEADOF ENTERING THE DRAWINGROOM THEY WALKED ALONG THE HALL AND STOODAGAINST THE FIREPLACE WHERE THE FROSTY AIR HELPED TO MAKE A GLOWINGBANK. YOU SEE I CAN LEAVE THE WHISTTABLE EASILY ENOUGH HE WENT ONSMILING AT LYDGATE NOW I DONT PLAY FOR MONEY. I OWE THAT TO YOUMRS. CASAUBON SAYS.HOW SAID LYDGATE COLDLY.AH YOU DIDNT MEAN ME TO KNOW IT I CALL THAT UNGENEROUS RETICENCE.YOU SHOULD LET A MAN HAVE THE PLEASURE OF FEELING THAT YOU HAVE DONEHIM A GOOD TURN. I DONT ENTER INTO SOME PEOPLES DISLIKE OF BEINGUNDER AN OBLIGATION UPON MY WORD I PREFER BEING UNDER AN OBLIGATIONTO EVERYBODY FOR BEHAVING WELL TO ME.I CANT TELL WHAT YOU MEAN SAID LYDGATE UNLESS IT IS THAT I ONCESPOKE OF YOU TO MRS. CASAUBON. BUT I DID NOT THINK THAT SHE WOULD BREAKHER PROMISE NOT TO MENTION THAT I HAD DONE SO SAID LYDGATE LEANINGHIS BACK AGAINST THE CORNER OF THE MANTELPIECE AND SHOWING NORADIANCE IN HIS FACE.IT WAS BROOKE WHO LET IT OUT ONLY THE OTHER DAY. HE PAID ME THECOMPLIMENT OF SAYING THAT HE WAS VERY GLAD I HAD THE LIVING THOUGH YOUHAD COME ACROSS HIS TACTICS AND HAD PRAISED ME UP AS A KEN AND ATILLOTSON AND THAT SORT OF THING TILL MRS. CASAUBON WOULD HEAR OF NOONE ELSE.OH BROOKE IS SUCH A LEAKYMINDED FOOL SAID LYDGATE CONTEMPTUOUSLY.WELL I WAS GLAD OF THE LEAKINESS THEN. I DONT SEE WHY YOU SHOULDNTLIKE ME TO KNOW THAT YOU WISHED TO DO ME A SERVICE MY DEAR FELLOW. ANDYOU CERTAINLY HAVE DONE ME ONE. ITS RATHER A STRONG CHECK TO ONESSELFCOMPLACENCY TO FIND HOW MUCH OF ONES RIGHT DOING DEPENDS ON NOTBEING IN WANT OF MONEY. A MAN WILL NOT BE TEMPTED TO SAY THE LORDSPRAYER BACKWARD TO PLEASE THE DEVIL IF HE DOESNT WANT THE DEVILSSERVICES. I HAVE NO NEED TO HANG ON THE SMILES OF CHANCE NOW.I DONT SEE THAT THERES ANY MONEYGETTING WITHOUT CHANCE SAIDLYDGATE IF A MAN GETS IT IN A PROFESSION ITS PRETTY SURE TO COME BYCHANCE.MR. FAREBROTHER THOUGHT HE COULD ACCOUNT FOR THIS SPEECH IN STRIKINGCONTRAST WITH LYDGATES FORMER WAY OF TALKING AS THE PERVERSITY WHICHWILL OFTEN SPRING FROM THE MOODINESS OF A MAN ILL AT EASE IN HISAFFAIRS. HE ANSWERED IN A TONE OF GOODHUMORED ADMISSIONAH THERES ENORMOUS PATIENCE WANTED WITH THE WAY OF THE WORLD. BUT ITIS THE EASIER FOR A MAN TO WAIT PATIENTLY WHEN HE HAS FRIENDS WHO LOVEHIM AND ASK FOR NOTHING BETTER THAN TO HELP HIM THROUGH SO FAR AS ITLIES IN THEIR POWER.OH YES SAID LYDGATE IN A CARELESS TONE CHANGING HIS ATTITUDE ANDLOOKING AT HIS WATCH. PEOPLE MAKE MUCH MORE OF THEIR DIFFICULTIES THANTHEY NEED TO DO.HE KNEW AS DISTINCTLY AS POSSIBLE THAT THIS WAS AN OFFER OF HELP TOHIMSELF FROM MR. FAREBROTHER AND HE COULD NOT BEAR IT. SO STRANGELYDETERMINED ARE WE MORTALS THAT AFTER HAVING BEEN LONG GRATIFIED WITHTHE SENSE THAT HE HAD PRIVATELY DONE THE VICAR A SERVICE THESUGGESTION THAT THE VICAR DISCERNED HIS NEED OF A SERVICE IN RETURNMADE HIM SHRINK INTO UNCONQUERABLE RETICENCE. BESIDES BEHIND ALLMAKING OF SUCH OFFERS WHAT ELSE MUST COMETHAT HE SHOULD MENTION HISCASE IMPLY THAT HE WANTED SPECIFIC THINGS. AT THAT MOMENT SUICIDESEEMED EASIER.MR. FAREBROTHER WAS TOO KEEN A MAN NOT TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THATREPLY AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN MASSIVENESS IN LYDGATES MANNER ANDTONE CORRESPONDING WITH HIS PHYSIQUE WHICH IF HE REPELLED YOURADVANCES IN THE FIRST INSTANCE SEEMED TO PUT PERSUASIVE DEVICES OUT OFQUESTION.WHAT TIME ARE YOU SAID THE VICAR DEVOURING HIS WOUNDED FEELING.AFTER ELEVEN SAID LYDGATE. AND THEY WENT INTO THE DRAWINGROOM.CHAPTER LXIV.ST GENT. WHERE LIES THE POWER THERE LET THE BLAME LIE TOO.D GENT. NAY POWER IS RELATIVE YOU CANNOT FRIGHT    THE COMING PEST WITH BORDER FORTRESSES    OR CATCH YOUR CARP WITH SUBTLE ARGUMENT.    ALL FORCE IS TWAIN IN ONE CAUSE IS NOT CAUSE    UNLESS EFFECT BE THERE AND ACTIONS SELF    MUST NEEDS CONTAIN A PASSIVE. SO COMMAND    EXISTS BUT WITH OBEDIENCE.EVEN IF LYDGATE HAD BEEN INCLINED TO BE QUITE OPEN ABOUT HIS AFFAIRSHE KNEW THAT IT WOULD HAVE HARDLY BEEN IN MR. FAREBROTHERS POWER TOGIVE HIM THE HELP HE IMMEDIATELY WANTED. WITH THE YEARS BILLS COMINGIN FROM HIS TRADESMEN WITH DOVERS THREATENING HOLD ON HIS FURNITUREAND WITH NOTHING TO DEPEND ON BUT SLOW DRIBBLING PAYMENTS FROM PATIENTSWHO MUST NOT BE OFFENDEDFOR THE HANDSOME FEES HE HAD HAD FROM FRESHITTHALL AND LOWICK MANOR HAD BEEN EASILY ABSORBEDNOTHING LESS THAN ATHOUSAND POUNDS WOULD HAVE FREED HIM FROM ACTUAL EMBARRASSMENT ANDLEFT A RESIDUE WHICH ACCORDING TO THE FAVORITE PHRASE OF HOPEFULNESSIN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM TIME TO LOOK ABOUT HIM.NATURALLY THE MERRY CHRISTMAS BRINGING THE HAPPY NEW YEAR WHENFELLOWCITIZENS EXPECT TO BE PAID FOR THE TROUBLE AND GOODS THEY HAVESMILINGLY BESTOWED ON THEIR NEIGHBORS HAD SO TIGHTENED THE PRESSURE OFSORDID CARES ON LYDGATES MIND THAT IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE FOR HIM TOTHINK UNBROKENLY OF ANY OTHER SUBJECT EVEN THE MOST HABITUAL ANDSOLICITING. HE WAS NOT AN ILLTEMPERED MAN HIS INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITYTHE ARDENT KINDNESS OF HIS HEART AS WELL AS HIS STRONG FRAME WOULDALWAYS UNDER TOLERABLY EASY CONDITIONS HAVE KEPT HIM ABOVE THE PETTYUNCONTROLLED SUSCEPTIBILITIES WHICH MAKE BAD TEMPER. BUT HE WAS NOW APREY TO THAT WORST IRRITATION WHICH ARISES NOT SIMPLY FROM ANNOYANCESBUT FROM THE SECOND CONSCIOUSNESS UNDERLYING THOSE ANNOYANCES OFWASTED ENERGY AND A DEGRADING PREOCCUPATION WHICH WAS THE REVERSE OFALL HIS FORMER PURPOSES. THIS IS WHAT I AM THINKING OF AND THATIS WHAT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN THINKING OF WAS THE BITTER INCESSANT MURMURWITHIN HIM MAKING EVERY DIFFICULTY A DOUBLE GOAD TO IMPATIENCE.SOME GENTLEMEN HAVE MADE AN AMAZING FIGURE IN LITERATURE BY GENERALDISCONTENT WITH THE UNIVERSE AS A TRAP OF DULNESS INTO WHICH THEIRGREAT SOULS HAVE FALLEN BY MISTAKE BUT THE SENSE OF A STUPENDOUS SELFAND AN INSIGNIFICANT WORLD MAY HAVE ITS CONSOLATIONS. LYDGATESDISCONTENT WAS MUCH HARDER TO BEAR IT WAS THE SENSE THAT THERE WAS AGRAND EXISTENCE IN THOUGHT AND EFFECTIVE ACTION LYING AROUND HIM WHILEHIS SELF WAS BEING NARROWED INTO THE MISERABLE ISOLATION OF EGOISTICFEARS AND VULGAR ANXIETIES FOR EVENTS THAT MIGHT ALLAY SUCH FEARS. HISTROUBLES WILL PERHAPS APPEAR MISERABLY SORDID AND BENEATH THEATTENTION OF LOFTY PERSONS WHO CAN KNOW NOTHING OF DEBT EXCEPT ON AMAGNIFICENT SCALE. DOUBTLESS THEY WERE SORDID AND FOR THE MAJORITYWHO ARE NOT LOFTY THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM SORDIDNESS BUT BY BEING FREEFROM MONEYCRAVING WITH ALL ITS BASE HOPES AND TEMPTATIONS ITSWATCHING FOR DEATH ITS HINTED REQUESTS ITS HORSEDEALERS DESIRE TOMAKE BAD WORK PASS FOR GOOD ITS SEEKING FOR FUNCTION WHICH OUGHT TO BEANOTHERS ITS COMPULSION OFTEN TO LONG FOR LUCK IN THE SHAPE OF A WIDECALAMITY.IT WAS BECAUSE LYDGATE WRITHED UNDER THE IDEA OF GETTING HIS NECKBENEATH THIS VILE YOKE THAT HE HAD FALLEN INTO A BITTER MOODY STATEWHICH WAS CONTINUALLY WIDENING ROSAMONDS ALIENATION FROM HIM. AFTERTHE FIRST DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE BILL OF SALE HE HAD MADE MANY EFFORTSTO DRAW HER INTO SYMPATHY WITH HIM ABOUT POSSIBLE MEASURES FORNARROWING THEIR EXPENSES AND WITH THE THREATENING APPROACH OFCHRISTMAS HIS PROPOSITIONS GREW MORE AND MORE DEFINITE. WE TWO CAN DOWITH ONLY ONE SERVANT AND LIVE ON VERY LITTLE HE SAID AND I SHALLMANAGE WITH ONE HORSE. FOR LYDGATE AS WE HAVE SEEN HAD BEGUN TOREASON WITH A MORE DISTINCT VISION ABOUT THE EXPENSES OF LIVING ANDANY SHARE OF PRIDE HE HAD GIVEN TO APPEARANCES OF THAT SORT WAS MEAGRECOMPARED WITH THE PRIDE WHICH MADE HIM REVOLT FROM EXPOSURE AS ADEBTOR OR FROM ASKING MEN TO HELP HIM WITH THEIR MONEY.OF COURSE YOU CAN DISMISS THE OTHER TWO SERVANTS IF YOU LIKE SAIDROSAMOND BUT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY INJURIOUS TO YOURPOSITION FOR US TO LIVE IN A POOR WAY. YOU MUST EXPECT YOUR PRACTICE TOBE LOWERED.MY DEAR ROSAMOND IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF CHOICE. WE HAVE BEGUN TOOEXPENSIVELY. PEACOCK YOU KNOW LIVED IN A MUCH SMALLER HOUSE THANTHIS. IT IS MY FAULT I OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN BETTER AND I DESERVE ATHRASHINGIF THERE WERE ANYBODY WHO HAD A RIGHT TO GIVE IT MEFORBRINGING YOU INTO THE NECESSITY OF LIVING IN A POORER WAY THAN YOU HAVEBEEN USED TO. BUT WE MARRIED BECAUSE WE LOVED EACH OTHER I SUPPOSE.AND THAT MAY HELP US TO PULL ALONG TILL THINGS GET BETTER. COME DEARPUT DOWN THAT WORK AND COME TO ME.HE WAS REALLY IN CHILL GLOOM ABOUT HER AT THAT MOMENT BUT HE DREADED AFUTURE WITHOUT AFFECTION AND WAS DETERMINED TO RESIST THE ONCOMING OFDIVISION BETWEEN THEM. ROSAMOND OBEYED HIM AND HE TOOK HER ON HISKNEE BUT IN HER SECRET SOUL SHE WAS UTTERLY ALOOF FROM HIM. THE POORTHING SAW ONLY THAT THE WORLD WAS NOT ORDERED TO HER LIKING ANDLYDGATE WAS PART OF THAT WORLD. BUT HE HELD HER WAIST WITH ONE HAND ANDLAID THE OTHER GENTLY ON BOTH OF HERS FOR THIS RATHER ABRUPT MAN HADMUCH TENDERNESS IN HIS MANNERS TOWARDS WOMEN SEEMING TO HAVE ALWAYSPRESENT IN HIS IMAGINATION THE WEAKNESS OF THEIR FRAMES AND THEDELICATE POISE OF THEIR HEALTH BOTH IN BODY AND MIND. AND HE BEGANAGAIN TO SPEAK PERSUASIVELY.I FIND NOW I LOOK INTO THINGS A LITTLE ROSY THAT IT IS WONDERFULWHAT AN AMOUNT OF MONEY SLIPS AWAY IN OUR HOUSEKEEPING. I SUPPOSE THESERVANTS ARE CARELESS AND WE HAVE HAD A GREAT MANY PEOPLE COMING. BUTTHERE MUST BE MANY IN OUR RANK WHO MANAGE WITH MUCH LESS THEY MUST DOWITH COMMONER THINGS I SUPPOSE AND LOOK AFTER THE SCRAPS. IT SEEMSMONEY GOES BUT A LITTLE WAY IN THESE MATTERS FOR WRENCH HAS EVERYTHINGAS PLAIN AS POSSIBLE AND HE HAS A VERY LARGE PRACTICE.OH IF YOU THINK OF LIVING AS THE WRENCHES DO SAID ROSAMOND WITH ALITTLE TURN OF HER NECK. BUT I HAVE HEARD YOU EXPRESS YOUR DISGUST ATTHAT WAY OF LIVING.YES THEY HAVE BAD TASTE IN EVERYTHINGTHEY MAKE ECONOMY LOOK UGLY. WENEEDNT DO THAT. I ONLY MEANT THAT THEY AVOID EXPENSES ALTHOUGH WRENCHHAS A CAPITAL PRACTICE.WHY SHOULD NOT YOU HAVE A GOOD PRACTICE TERTIUS MR. PEACOCK HAD. YOUSHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL NOT TO OFFEND PEOPLE AND YOU SHOULD SEND OUTMEDICINES AS THE OTHERS DO. I AM SURE YOU BEGAN WELL AND YOU GOTSEVERAL GOOD HOUSES. IT CANNOT ANSWER TO BE ECCENTRIC YOU SHOULD THINKWHAT WILL BE GENERALLY LIKED SAID ROSAMOND IN A DECIDED LITTLE TONEOF ADMONITION.LYDGATES ANGER ROSE HE WAS PREPARED TO BE INDULGENT TOWARDS FEMININEWEAKNESS BUT NOT TOWARDS FEMININE DICTATION. THE SHALLOWNESS OF AWATERNIXIES SOUL MAY HAVE A CHARM UNTIL SHE BECOMES DIDACTIC. BUT HECONTROLLED HIMSELF AND ONLY SAID WITH A TOUCH OF DESPOTIC FIRMNESSWHAT I AM TO DO IN MY PRACTICE ROSY IT IS FOR ME TO JUDGE. THAT ISNOT THE QUESTION BETWEEN US. IT IS ENOUGH FOR YOU TO KNOW THAT OURINCOME IS LIKELY TO BE A VERY NARROW ONEHARDLY FOUR HUNDRED PERHAPSLESS FOR A LONG TIME TO COME AND WE MUST TRY TO REARRANGE OUR LIVESIN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT FACT.ROSAMOND WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT OR TWO LOOKING BEFORE HER AND THENSAID MY UNCLE BULSTRODE OUGHT TO ALLOW YOU A SALARY FOR THE TIME YOUGIVE TO THE HOSPITAL IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD WORK FORNOTHING.IT WAS UNDERSTOOD FROM THE BEGINNING THAT MY SERVICES WOULD BEGRATUITOUS. THAT AGAIN NEED NOT ENTER INTO OUR DISCUSSION. I HAVEPOINTED OUT WHAT IS THE ONLY PROBABILITY SAID LYDGATE IMPATIENTLY.THEN CHECKING HIMSELF HE WENT ON MORE QUIETLYI THINK I SEE ONE RESOURCE WHICH WOULD FREE US FROM A GOOD DEAL OF THEPRESENT DIFFICULTY. I HEAR THAT YOUNG NED PLYMDALE IS GOING TO BEMARRIED TO MISS SOPHY TOLLER. THEY ARE RICH AND IT IS NOT OFTEN THAT AGOOD HOUSE IS VACANT IN MIDDLEMARCH. I FEEL SURE THAT THEY WOULD BEGLAD TO TAKE THIS HOUSE FROM US WITH MOST OF OUR FURNITURE AND THEYWOULD BE WILLING TO PAY HANDSOMELY FOR THE LEASE. I CAN EMPLOY TRUMBULLTO SPEAK TO PLYMDALE ABOUT IT.ROSAMOND LEFT HER HUSBANDS KNEE AND WALKED SLOWLY TO THE OTHER END OFTHE ROOM WHEN SHE TURNED ROUND AND WALKED TOWARDS HIM IT WAS EVIDENTTHAT THE TEARS HAD COME AND THAT SHE WAS BITING HER UNDERLIP ANDCLASPING HER HANDS TO KEEP HERSELF FROM CRYING. LYDGATE WASWRETCHEDSHAKEN WITH ANGER AND YET FEELING THAT IT WOULD BE UNMANLY TOVENT THE ANGER JUST NOW.I AM VERY SORRY ROSAMOND I KNOW THIS IS PAINFUL.I THOUGHT AT LEAST WHEN I HAD BORNE TO SEND THE PLATE BACK AND HAVETHAT MAN TAKING AN INVENTORY OF THE FURNITUREI SHOULD HAVE THOUGHTTHAT WOULD SUFFICE.I EXPLAINED IT TO YOU AT THE TIME DEAR. THAT WAS ONLY A SECURITY ANDBEHIND THAT SECURITY THERE IS A DEBT. AND THAT DEBT MUST BE PAID WITHINTHE NEXT FEW MONTHS ELSE WE SHALL HAVE OUR FURNITURE SOLD. IF YOUNGPLYMDALE WILL TAKE OUR HOUSE AND MOST OF OUR FURNITURE WE SHALL BEABLE TO PAY THAT DEBT AND SOME OTHERS TOO AND WE SHALL BE QUIT OF APLACE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR US. WE MIGHT TAKE A SMALLER HOUSE TRUMBULL IKNOW HAS A VERY DECENT ONE TO LET AT THIRTY POUNDS AYEAR AND THIS ISNINETY. LYDGATE UTTERED THIS SPEECH IN THE CURT HAMMERING WAY WITHWHICH WE USUALLY TRY TO NAIL DOWN A VAGUE MIND TO IMPERATIVE FACTS.TEARS ROLLED SILENTLY DOWN ROSAMONDS CHEEKS SHE JUST PRESSED HERHANDKERCHIEF AGAINST THEM AND STOOD LOOKING AT THE LARGE VASE ON THEMANTELPIECE. IT WAS A MOMENT OF MORE INTENSE BITTERNESS THAN SHE HADEVER FELT BEFORE. AT LAST SHE SAID WITHOUT HURRY AND WITH CAREFULEMPHASISI NEVER COULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ACT IN THAT WAY.LIKE IT BURST OUT LYDGATE RISING FROM HIS CHAIR THRUSTING HISHANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND STALKING AWAY FROM THE HEARTH ITS NOT AQUESTION OF LIKING. OF COURSE I DONT LIKE IT ITS THE ONLY THING ICAN DO. HE WHEELED ROUND THERE AND TURNED TOWARDS HER.I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THERE WERE MANY OTHER MEANS THAN THAT SAIDROSAMOND. LET US HAVE A SALE AND LEAVE MIDDLEMARCH ALTOGETHER.TO DO WHAT WHAT IS THE USE OF MY LEAVING MY WORK IN MIDDLEMARCH TO GOWHERE I HAVE NONE WE SHOULD BE JUST AS PENNILESS ELSEWHERE AS WE AREHERE SAID LYDGATE STILL MORE ANGRILY.IF WE ARE TO BE IN THAT POSITION IT WILL BE ENTIRELY YOUR OWN DOINGTERTIUS SAID ROSAMOND TURNING ROUND TO SPEAK WITH THE FULLESTCONVICTION. YOU WILL NOT BEHAVE AS YOU OUGHT TO DO TO YOUR OWN FAMILY.YOU OFFENDED CAPTAIN LYDGATE. SIR GODWIN WAS VERY KIND TO ME WHEN WEWERE AT QUALLINGHAM AND I AM SURE IF YOU SHOWED PROPER REGARD TO HIMAND TOLD HIM YOUR AFFAIRS HE WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR YOU. BUT RATHERTHAN THAT YOU LIKE GIVING UP OUR HOUSE AND FURNITURE TO MR. NEDPLYMDALE.THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE FIERCENESS IN LYDGATES EYES AS HE ANSWEREDWITH NEW VIOLENCE WELL THEN IF YOU WILL HAVE IT SO I DO LIKE IT. IADMIT THAT I LIKE IT BETTER THAN MAKING A FOOL OF MYSELF BY GOING TOBEG WHERE ITS OF NO USE. UNDERSTAND THEN THAT IT IS WHAT I LIKE TODO.THERE WAS A TONE IN THE LAST SENTENCE WHICH WAS EQUIVALENT TO THECLUTCH OF HIS STRONG HAND ON ROSAMONDS DELICATE ARM. BUT FOR ALL THATHIS WILL WAS NOT A WHIT STRONGER THAN HERS. SHE IMMEDIATELY WALKED OUTOF THE ROOM IN SILENCE BUT WITH AN INTENSE DETERMINATION TO HINDERWHAT LYDGATE LIKED TO DO.HE WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE BUT AS HIS BLOOD COOLED HE FELT THAT THECHIEF RESULT OF THE DISCUSSION WAS A DEPOSIT OF DREAD WITHIN HIM AT THEIDEA OF OPENING WITH HIS WIFE IN FUTURE SUBJECTS WHICH MIGHT AGAIN URGEHIM TO VIOLENT SPEECH. IT WAS AS IF A FRACTURE IN DELICATE CRYSTAL HADBEGUN AND HE WAS AFRAID OF ANY MOVEMENT THAT MIGHT MAKE IT FATAL. HISMARRIAGE WOULD BE A MERE PIECE OF BITTER IRONY IF THEY COULD NOT GO ONLOVING EACH OTHER. HE HAD LONG AGO MADE UP HIS MIND TO WHAT HE THOUGHTWAS HER NEGATIVE CHARACTERHER WANT OF SENSIBILITY WHICH SHOWED ITSELFIN DISREGARD BOTH OF HIS SPECIFIC WISHES AND OF HIS GENERAL AIMS. THEFIRST GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT HAD BEEN BORNE THE TENDER DEVOTEDNESS ANDDOCILE ADORATION OF THE IDEAL WIFE MUST BE RENOUNCED AND LIFE MUST BETAKEN UP ON A LOWER STAGE OF EXPECTATION AS IT IS BY MEN WHO HAVE LOSTTHEIR LIMBS. BUT THE REAL WIFE HAD NOT ONLY HER CLAIMS SHE HAD STILL AHOLD ON HIS HEART AND IT WAS HIS INTENSE DESIRE THAT THE HOLD SHOULDREMAIN STRONG. IN MARRIAGE THE CERTAINTY SHE WILL NEVER LOVE MEMUCH IS EASIER TO BEAR THAN THE FEAR I SHALL LOVE HER NO MORE.HENCE AFTER THAT OUTBURST HIS INWARD EFFORT WAS ENTIRELY TO EXCUSEHER AND TO BLAME THE HARD CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WERE PARTLY HIS FAULT.HE TRIED THAT EVENING BY PETTING HER TO HEAL THE WOUND HE HAD MADE INTHE MORNING AND IT WAS NOT IN ROSAMONDS NATURE TO BE REPELLENT ORSULKY INDEED SHE WELCOMED THE SIGNS THAT HER HUSBAND LOVED HER ANDWAS UNDER CONTROL. BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING QUITE DISTINCT FROM LOVINGHIM. LYDGATE WOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN SOON TO RECUR TO THE PLAN OFPARTING WITH THE HOUSE HE WAS RESOLVED TO CARRY IT OUT AND SAY ASLITTLE MORE ABOUT IT AS POSSIBLE. BUT ROSAMOND HERSELF TOUCHED ON IT ATBREAKFAST BY SAYING MILDLYHAVE YOU SPOKEN TO TRUMBULL YETNO SAID LYDGATE BUT I SHALL CALL ON HIM AS I GO BY THIS MORNING.NO TIME MUST BE LOST. HE TOOK ROSAMONDS QUESTION AS A SIGN THAT SHEWITHDREW HER INWARD OPPOSITION AND KISSED HER HEAD CARESSINGLY WHEN HEGOT UP TO GO AWAY.AS SOON AS IT WAS LATE ENOUGH TO MAKE A CALL ROSAMOND WENT TO MRS.PLYMDALE MR. NEDS MOTHER AND ENTERED WITH PRETTY CONGRATULATIONSINTO THE SUBJECT OF THE COMING MARRIAGE. MRS. PLYMDALES MATERNAL VIEWWAS THAT ROSAMOND MIGHT POSSIBLY NOW HAVE RETROSPECTIVE GLIMPSES OFHER OWN FOLLY AND FEELING THE ADVANTAGES TO BE AT PRESENT ALL ON THESIDE OF HER SON WAS TOO KIND A WOMAN NOT TO BEHAVE GRACIOUSLY.YES NED IS MOST HAPPY I MUST SAY. AND SOPHY TOLLER IS ALL I COULDDESIRE IN A DAUGHTERINLAW. OF COURSE HER FATHER IS ABLE TO DOSOMETHING HANDSOME FOR HERTHAT IS ONLY WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED WITH ABREWERY LIKE HIS. AND THE CONNECTION IS EVERYTHING WE SHOULD DESIRE.BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT I LOOK AT. SHE IS SUCH A VERY NICE GIRLNO AIRSNO PRETENSIONS THOUGH ON A LEVEL WITH THE FIRST. I DONT MEAN WITH THETITLED ARISTOCRACY. I SEE VERY LITTLE GOOD IN PEOPLE AIMING OUT OFTHEIR OWN SPHERE. I MEAN THAT SOPHY IS EQUAL TO THE BEST IN THE TOWNAND SHE IS CONTENTED WITH THAT.I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT HER VERY AGREEABLE SAID ROSAMOND.I LOOK UPON IT AS A REWARD FOR NED WHO NEVER HELD HIS HEAD TOO HIGHTHAT HE SHOULD HAVE GOT INTO THE VERY BEST CONNECTION CONTINUED MRS.PLYMDALE HER NATIVE SHARPNESS SOFTENED BY A FERVID SENSE THAT SHE WASTAKING A CORRECT VIEW. AND SUCH PARTICULAR PEOPLE AS THE TOLLERS ARETHEY MIGHT HAVE OBJECTED BECAUSE SOME OF OUR FRIENDS ARE NOT THEIRS. ITIS WELL KNOWN THAT YOUR AUNT BULSTRODE AND I HAVE BEEN INTIMATE FROMOUR YOUTH AND MR. PLYMDALE HAS BEEN ALWAYS ON MR. BULSTRODES SIDE.AND I MYSELF PREFER SERIOUS OPINIONS. BUT THE TOLLERS HAVE WELCOMED NEDALL THE SAME.I AM SURE HE IS A VERY DESERVING WELLPRINCIPLED YOUNG MAN SAIDROSAMOND WITH A NEAT AIR OF PATRONAGE IN RETURN FOR MRS. PLYMDALESWHOLESOME CORRECTIONS.OH HE HAS NOT THE STYLE OF A CAPTAIN IN THE ARMY OR THAT SORT OFCARRIAGE AS IF EVERYBODY WAS BENEATH HIM OR THAT SHOWY KIND OFTALKING AND SINGING AND INTELLECTUAL TALENT. BUT I AM THANKFUL HE HASNOT. IT IS A POOR PREPARATION BOTH FOR HERE AND HEREAFTER.OH DEAR YES APPEARANCES HAVE VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH HAPPINESS SAIDROSAMOND. I THINK THERE IS EVERY PROSPECT OF THEIR BEING A HAPPYCOUPLE. WHAT HOUSE WILL THEY TAKEOH AS FOR THAT THEY MUST PUT UP WITH WHAT THEY CAN GET. THEY HAVEBEEN LOOKING AT THE HOUSE IN ST. PETERS PLACE NEXT TO MR. HACKBUTTSIT BELONGS TO HIM AND HE IS PUTTING IT NICELY IN REPAIR. I SUPPOSETHEY ARE NOT LIKELY TO HEAR OF A BETTER. INDEED I THINK NED WILLDECIDE THE MATTER TODAY.I SHOULD THINK IT IS A NICE HOUSE I LIKE ST. PETERS PLACE.WELL IT IS NEAR THE CHURCH AND A GENTEEL SITUATION. BUT THE WINDOWSARE NARROW AND IT IS ALL UPS AND DOWNS. YOU DONT HAPPEN TO KNOW OFANY OTHER THAT WOULD BE AT LIBERTY SAID MRS. PLYMDALE FIXING HERROUND BLACK EYES ON ROSAMOND WITH THE ANIMATION OF A SUDDEN THOUGHT INTHEM.OH NO I HEAR SO LITTLE OF THOSE THINGS.ROSAMOND HAD NOT FORESEEN THAT QUESTION AND ANSWER IN SETTING OUT TOPAY HER VISIT SHE HAD SIMPLY MEANT TO GATHER ANY INFORMATION WHICHWOULD HELP HER TO AVERT THE PARTING WITH HER OWN HOUSE UNDERCIRCUMSTANCES THOROUGHLY DISAGREEABLE TO HER. AS TO THE UNTRUTH IN HERREPLY SHE NO MORE REFLECTED ON IT THAN SHE DID ON THE UNTRUTH THEREWAS IN HER SAYING THAT APPEARANCES HAD VERY LITTLE TO DO WITHHAPPINESS. HER OBJECT SHE WAS CONVINCED WAS THOROUGHLY JUSTIFIABLEIT WAS LYDGATE WHOSE INTENTION WAS INEXCUSABLE AND THERE WAS A PLAN INHER MIND WHICH WHEN SHE HAD CARRIED IT OUT FULLY WOULD PROVE HOW VERYFALSE A STEP IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR HIM TO HAVE DESCENDED FROM HISPOSITION.SHE RETURNED HOME BY MR. BORTHROP TRUMBULLS OFFICE MEANING TO CALLTHERE. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE THAT ROSAMOND HAD THOUGHT OFDOING ANYTHING IN THE FORM OF BUSINESS BUT SHE FELT EQUAL TO THEOCCASION. THAT SHE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO DO WHAT SHE INTENSELY DISLIKEDWAS AN IDEA WHICH TURNED HER QUIET TENACITY INTO ACTIVE INVENTION. HEREWAS A CASE IN WHICH IT COULD NOT BE ENOUGH SIMPLY TO DISOBEY AND BESERENELY PLACIDLY OBSTINATE SHE MUST ACT ACCORDING TO HER JUDGMENTAND SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT HER JUDGMENT WAS RIGHTINDEED IF IT HADNOT BEEN SHE WOULD NOT HAVE WISHED TO ACT ON IT.MR. TRUMBULL WAS IN THE BACKROOM OF HIS OFFICE AND RECEIVED ROSAMONDWITH HIS FINEST MANNERS NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD MUCH SENSIBILITY TOHER CHARMS BUT BECAUSE THE GOODNATURED FIBRE IN HIM WAS STIRRED BYHIS CERTAINTY THAT LYDGATE WAS IN DIFFICULTIES AND THAT THISUNCOMMONLY PRETTY WOMANTHIS YOUNG LADY WITH THE HIGHEST PERSONALATTRACTIONSWAS LIKELY TO FEEL THE PINCH OF TROUBLETO FIND HERSELFINVOLVED IN CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND HER CONTROL. HE BEGGED HER TO DO HIMTHE HONOR TO TAKE A SEAT AND STOOD BEFORE HER TRIMMING AND COMPORTINGHIMSELF WITH AN EAGER SOLICITUDE WHICH WAS CHIEFLY BENEVOLENT.ROSAMONDS FIRST QUESTION WAS WHETHER HER HUSBAND HAD CALLED ON MR.TRUMBULL THAT MORNING TO SPEAK ABOUT DISPOSING OF THEIR HOUSE.YES MAAM YES HE DID HE DID SO SAID THE GOOD AUCTIONEER TRYINGTO THROW SOMETHING SOOTHING INTO HIS ITERATION. I WAS ABOUT TO FULFILHIS ORDER IF POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON. HE WISHED ME NOT TOPROCRASTINATE.I CALLED TO TELL YOU NOT TO GO ANY FURTHER MR. TRUMBULL AND I BEG OFYOU NOT TO MENTION WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ON THE SUBJECT. WILL YOU OBLIGEMECERTAINLY I WILL MRS. LYDGATE CERTAINLY. CONFIDENCE IS SACRED WITHME ON BUSINESS OR ANY OTHER TOPIC. I AM THEN TO CONSIDER THE COMMISSIONWITHDRAWN SAID MR. TRUMBULL ADJUSTING THE LONG ENDS OF HIS BLUECRAVAT WITH BOTH HANDS AND LOOKING AT ROSAMOND DEFERENTIALLY.YES IF YOU PLEASE. I FIND THAT MR. NED PLYMDALE HAS TAKEN A HOUSETHEONE IN ST. PETERS PLACE NEXT TO MR. HACKBUTTS. MR. LYDGATE WOULD BEANNOYED THAT HIS ORDERS SHOULD BE FULFILLED USELESSLY. AND BESIDESTHAT THERE ARE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH RENDER THE PROPOSALUNNECESSARY.VERY GOOD MRS. LYDGATE VERY GOOD. I AM AT YOUR COMMANDS WHENEVERYOU REQUIRE ANY SERVICE OF ME SAID MR. TRUMBULL WHO FELT PLEASURE INCONJECTURING THAT SOME NEW RESOURCES HAD BEEN OPENED. RELY ON ME IBEG. THE AFFAIR SHALL GO NO FURTHER.THAT EVENING LYDGATE WAS A LITTLE COMFORTED BY OBSERVING THAT ROSAMONDWAS MORE LIVELY THAN SHE HAD USUALLY BEEN OF LATE AND EVEN SEEMEDINTERESTED IN DOING WHAT WOULD PLEASE HIM WITHOUT BEING ASKED. HETHOUGHT IF SHE WILL BE HAPPY AND I CAN RUB THROUGH WHAT DOES IT ALLSIGNIFY IT IS ONLY A NARROW SWAMP THAT WE HAVE TO PASS IN A LONGJOURNEY. IF I CAN GET MY MIND CLEAR AGAIN I SHALL DO.HE WAS SO MUCH CHEERED THAT HE BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR AN ACCOUNT OFEXPERIMENTS WHICH HE HAD LONG AGO MEANT TO LOOK UP AND HAD NEGLECTEDOUT OF THAT CREEPING SELFDESPAIR WHICH COMES IN THE TRAIN OF PETTYANXIETIES. HE FELT AGAIN SOME OF THE OLD DELIGHTFUL ABSORPTION IN AFARREACHING INQUIRY WHILE ROSAMOND PLAYED THE QUIET MUSIC WHICH WASAS HELPFUL TO HIS MEDITATION AS THE PLASH OF AN OAR ON THE EVENINGLAKE. IT WAS RATHER LATE HE HAD PUSHED AWAY ALL THE BOOKS AND WASLOOKING AT THE FIRE WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED BEHIND HIS HEAD INFORGETFULNESS OF EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEWCONTROLLING EXPERIMENT WHEN ROSAMOND WHO HAD LEFT THE PIANO AND WASLEANING BACK IN HER CHAIR WATCHING HIM SAIDMR. NED PLYMDALE HAS TAKEN A HOUSE ALREADY.LYDGATE STARTLED AND JARRED LOOKED UP IN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT LIKE AMAN WHO HAS BEEN DISTURBED IN HIS SLEEP. THEN FLUSHING WITH ANUNPLEASANT CONSCIOUSNESS HE ASKEDHOW DO YOU KNOWI CALLED AT MRS. PLYMDALES THIS MORNING AND SHE TOLD ME THAT HE HADTAKEN THE HOUSE IN ST. PETERS PLACE NEXT TO MR. HACKBUTTS.LYDGATE WAS SILENT. HE DREW HIS HANDS FROM BEHIND HIS HEAD AND PRESSEDTHEM AGAINST THE HAIR WHICH WAS HANGING AS IT WAS APT TO DO IN A MASSON HIS FOREHEAD WHILE HE RESTED HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES. HE WASFEELING BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT AS IF HE HAD OPENED A DOOR OUT OF ASUFFOCATING PLACE AND HAD FOUND IT WALLED UP BUT HE ALSO FELT SURETHAT ROSAMOND WAS PLEASED WITH THE CAUSE OF HIS DISAPPOINTMENT. HEPREFERRED NOT LOOKING AT HER AND NOT SPEAKING UNTIL HE HAD GOT OVERTHE FIRST SPASM OF VEXATION. AFTER ALL HE SAID IN HIS BITTERNESS WHATCAN A WOMAN CARE ABOUT SO MUCH AS HOUSE AND FURNITURE A HUSBANDWITHOUT THEM IS AN ABSURDITY. WHEN HE LOOKED UP AND PUSHED HIS HAIRASIDE HIS DARK EYES HAD A MISERABLE BLANK NONEXPECTANCE OF SYMPATHYIN THEM BUT HE ONLY SAID COOLLYPERHAPS SOME ONE ELSE MAY TURN UP. I TOLD TRUMBULL TO BE ON THELOOKOUT IF HE FAILED WITH PLYMDALE.ROSAMOND MADE NO REMARK. SHE TRUSTED TO THE CHANCE THAT NOTHING MOREWOULD PASS BETWEEN HER HUSBAND AND THE AUCTIONEER UNTIL SOME ISSUESHOULD HAVE JUSTIFIED HER INTERFERENCE AT ANY RATE SHE HAD HINDEREDTHE EVENT WHICH SHE IMMEDIATELY DREADED. AFTER A PAUSE SHE SAIDHOW MUCH MONEY IS IT THAT THOSE DISAGREEABLE PEOPLE WANTWHAT DISAGREEABLE PEOPLETHOSE WHO TOOK THE LISTAND THE OTHERS. I MEAN HOW MUCH MONEY WOULDSATISFY THEM SO THAT YOU NEED NOT BE TROUBLED ANY MORELYDGATE SURVEYED HER FOR A MOMENT AS IF HE WERE LOOKING FOR SYMPTOMSAND THEN SAID OH IF I COULD HAVE GOT SIX HUNDRED FROM PLYMDALE FORFURNITURE AND AS PREMIUM I MIGHT HAVE MANAGED. I COULD HAVE PAID OFFDOVER AND GIVEN ENOUGH ON ACCOUNT TO THE OTHERS TO MAKE THEM WAITPATIENTLY IF WE CONTRACTED OUR EXPENSES.BUT I MEAN HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU WANT IF WE STAYED IN THIS HOUSEMORE THAN I AM LIKELY TO GET ANYWHERE SAID LYDGATE WITH RATHER AGRATING SARCASM IN HIS TONE. IT ANGERED HIM TO PERCEIVE THAT ROSAMONDSMIND WAS WANDERING OVER IMPRACTICABLE WISHES INSTEAD OF FACING POSSIBLEEFFORTS.WHY SHOULD YOU NOT MENTION THE SUM SAID ROSAMOND WITH A MILDINDICATION THAT SHE DID NOT LIKE HIS MANNERS.WELL SAID LYDGATE IN A GUESSING TONE IT WOULD TAKE AT LEAST ATHOUSAND TO SET ME AT EASE. BUT HE ADDED INCISIVELY I HAVE TOCONSIDER WHAT I SHALL DO WITHOUT IT NOT WITH IT.ROSAMOND SAID NO MORE.BUT THE NEXT DAY SHE CARRIED OUT HER PLAN OF WRITING TO SIR GODWINLYDGATE. SINCE THE CAPTAINS VISIT SHE HAD RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIMAND ALSO ONE FROM MRS. MENGAN HIS MARRIED SISTER CONDOLING WITH HERON THE LOSS OF HER BABY AND EXPRESSING VAGUELY THE HOPE THAT THEYSHOULD SEE HER AGAIN AT QUALLINGHAM. LYDGATE HAD TOLD HER THAT THISPOLITENESS MEANT NOTHING BUT SHE WAS SECRETLY CONVINCED THAT ANYBACKWARDNESS IN LYDGATES FAMILY TOWARDS HIM WAS DUE TO HIS COLD ANDCONTEMPTUOUS BEHAVIOR AND SHE HAD ANSWERED THE LETTERS IN HER MOSTCHARMING MANNER FEELING SOME CONFIDENCE THAT A SPECIFIC INVITATIONWOULD FOLLOW. BUT THERE HAD BEEN TOTAL SILENCE. THE CAPTAIN EVIDENTLYWAS NOT A GREAT PENMAN AND ROSAMOND REFLECTED THAT THE SISTERS MIGHTHAVE BEEN ABROAD. HOWEVER THE SEASON WAS COME FOR THINKING OF FRIENDSAT HOME AND AT ANY RATE SIR GODWIN WHO HAD CHUCKED HER UNDER THECHIN AND PRONOUNCED HER TO BE LIKE THE CELEBRATED BEAUTY MRS. CROLYWHO HAD MADE A CONQUEST OF HIM IN  WOULD BE TOUCHED BY ANY APPEALFROM HER AND WOULD FIND IT PLEASANT FOR HER SAKE TO BEHAVE AS HE OUGHTTO DO TOWARDS HIS NEPHEW. ROSAMOND WAS NAIVELY CONVINCED OF WHAT AN OLDGENTLEMAN OUGHT TO DO TO PREVENT HER FROM SUFFERING ANNOYANCE. AND SHEWROTE WHAT SHE CONSIDERED THE MOST JUDICIOUS LETTER POSSIBLEONE WHICHWOULD STRIKE SIR GODWIN AS A PROOF OF HER EXCELLENT SENSEPOINTING OUTHOW DESIRABLE IT WAS THAT TERTIUS SHOULD QUIT SUCH A PLACE ASMIDDLEMARCH FOR ONE MORE FITTED TO HIS TALENTS HOW THE UNPLEASANTCHARACTER OF THE INHABITANTS HAD HINDERED HIS PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS ANDHOW IN CONSEQUENCE HE WAS IN MONEY DIFFICULTIES FROM WHICH IT WOULDREQUIRE A THOUSAND POUNDS THOROUGHLY TO EXTRICATE HIM. SHE DID NOT SAYTHAT TERTIUS WAS UNAWARE OF HER INTENTION TO WRITE FOR SHE HAD THEIDEA THAT HIS SUPPOSED SANCTION OF HER LETTER WOULD BE IN ACCORDANCEWITH WHAT SHE DID SAY OF HIS GREAT REGARD FOR HIS UNCLE GODWIN AS THERELATIVE WHO HAD ALWAYS BEEN HIS BEST FRIEND. SUCH WAS THE FORCE OFPOOR ROSAMONDS TACTICS NOW SHE APPLIED THEM TO AFFAIRS.THIS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE THE PARTY ON NEW YEARS DAY AND NO ANSWER HADYET COME FROM SIR GODWIN. BUT ON THE MORNING OF THAT DAY LYDGATE HAD TOLEARN THAT ROSAMOND HAD REVOKED HIS ORDER TO BORTHROP TRUMBULL. FEELINGIT NECESSARY THAT SHE SHOULD BE GRADUALLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE IDEA OFTHEIR QUITTING THE HOUSE IN LOWICK GATE HE OVERCAME HIS RELUCTANCE TOSPEAK TO HER AGAIN ON THE SUBJECT AND WHEN THEY WERE BREAKFASTINGSAIDI SHALL TRY TO SEE TRUMBULL THIS MORNING AND TELL HIM TO ADVERTISETHE HOUSE IN THE PIONEER AND THE TRUMPET. IF THE THING WEREADVERTISED SOME ONE MIGHT BE INCLINED TO TAKE IT WHO WOULD NOTOTHERWISE HAVE THOUGHT OF A CHANGE. IN THESE COUNTRY PLACES MANY PEOPLEGO ON IN THEIR OLD HOUSES WHEN THEIR FAMILIES ARE TOO LARGE FOR THEMFOR WANT OF KNOWING WHERE THEY CAN FIND ANOTHER. AND TRUMBULL SEEMS TOHAVE GOT NO BITE AT ALL.ROSAMOND KNEW THAT THE INEVITABLE MOMENT WAS COME. I ORDERED TRUMBULLNOT TO INQUIRE FURTHER SHE SAID WITH A CAREFUL CALMNESS WHICH WASEVIDENTLY DEFENSIVE.LYDGATE STARED AT HER IN MUTE AMAZEMENT. ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HEHAD BEEN FASTENING UP HER PLAITS FOR HER AND TALKING THE LITTLELANGUAGE OF AFFECTION WHICH ROSAMOND THOUGH NOT RETURNING ITACCEPTED AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A SERENE AND LOVELY IMAGE NOW AND THENMIRACULOUSLY DIMPLING TOWARDS HER VOTARY. WITH SUCH FIBRES STILL ASTIRIN HIM THE SHOCK HE RECEIVED COULD NOT AT ONCE BE DISTINCTLY ANGER ITWAS CONFUSED PAIN. HE LAID DOWN THE KNIFE AND FORK WITH WHICH HE WASCARVING AND THROWING HIMSELF BACK IN HIS CHAIR SAID AT LAST WITH ACOOL IRONY IN HIS TONEMAY I ASK WHEN AND WHY YOU DID SOWHEN I KNEW THAT THE PLYMDALES HAD TAKEN A HOUSE I CALLED TO TELL HIMNOT TO MENTION OURS TO THEM AND AT THE SAME TIME I TOLD HIM NOT TO LETTHE AFFAIR GO ON ANY FURTHER. I KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE VERY INJURIOUS TOYOU IF IT WERE KNOWN THAT YOU WISHED TO PART WITH YOUR HOUSE ANDFURNITURE AND I HAD A VERY STRONG OBJECTION TO IT. I THINK THAT WASREASON ENOUGH.IT WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE THEN THAT I HAD TOLD YOU IMPERATIVE REASONSOF ANOTHER KIND OF NO CONSEQUENCE THAT I HAD COME TO A DIFFERENTCONCLUSION AND GIVEN AN ORDER ACCORDINGLY SAID LYDGATE BITINGLYTHE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING GATHERING ABOUT HIS BROW AND EYES.THE EFFECT OF ANY ONES ANGER ON ROSAMOND HAD ALWAYS BEEN TO MAKE HERSHRINK IN COLD DISLIKE AND TO BECOME ALL THE MORE CALMLY CORRECT INTHE CONVICTION THAT SHE WAS NOT THE PERSON TO MISBEHAVE WHATEVER OTHERSMIGHT DO. SHE REPLIEDI THINK I HAD A PERFECT RIGHT TO SPEAK ON A SUBJECT WHICH CONCERNS MEAT LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU.CLEARLYYOU HAD A RIGHT TO SPEAK BUT ONLY TO ME. YOU HAD NO RIGHT TOCONTRADICT MY ORDERS SECRETLY AND TREAT ME AS IF I WERE A FOOL SAIDLYDGATE IN THE SAME TONE AS BEFORE. THEN WITH SOME ADDED SCORN IS ITPOSSIBLE TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE IS IT OFANY USE FOR ME TO TELL YOU AGAIN WHY WE MUST TRY TO PART WITH THEHOUSEIT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR YOU TO TELL ME AGAIN SAID ROSAMOND IN AVOICE THAT FELL AND TRICKLED LIKE COLD WATERDROPS. I REMEMBERED WHATYOU SAID. YOU SPOKE JUST AS VIOLENTLY AS YOU DO NOW. BUT THAT DOES NOTALTER MY OPINION THAT YOU OUGHT TO TRY EVERY OTHER MEANS RATHER THANTAKE A STEP WHICH IS SO PAINFUL TO ME. AND AS TO ADVERTISING THE HOUSEI THINK IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY DEGRADING TO YOU.AND SUPPOSE I DISREGARD YOUR OPINION AS YOU DISREGARD MINEYOU CAN DO SO OF COURSE. BUT I THINK YOU OUGHT TO HAVE TOLD ME BEFOREWE WERE MARRIED THAT YOU WOULD PLACE ME IN THE WORST POSITION RATHERTHAN GIVE UP YOUR OWN WILL.LYDGATE DID NOT SPEAK BUT TOSSED HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND TWITCHEDTHE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH IN DESPAIR. ROSAMOND SEEING THAT HE WAS NOTLOOKING AT HER ROSE AND SET HIS CUP OF COFFEE BEFORE HIM BUT HE TOOKNO NOTICE OF IT AND WENT ON WITH AN INWARD DRAMA AND ARGUMENTOCCASIONALLY MOVING IN HIS SEAT RESTING ONE ARM ON THE TABLE ANDRUBBING HIS HAND AGAINST HIS HAIR. THERE WAS A CONFLUX OF EMOTIONS ANDTHOUGHTS IN HIM THAT WOULD NOT LET HIM EITHER GIVE THOROUGH WAY TO HISANGER OR PERSEVERE WITH SIMPLE RIGIDITY OF RESOLVE. ROSAMOND TOOKADVANTAGE OF HIS SILENCE.WHEN WE WERE MARRIED EVERYONE FELT THAT YOUR POSITION WAS VERY HIGH. ICOULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED THEN THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO SELL OUR FURNITUREAND TAKE A HOUSE IN BRIDE STREET WHERE THE ROOMS ARE LIKE CAGES. IF WEARE TO LIVE IN THAT WAY LET US AT LEAST LEAVE MIDDLEMARCH.THESE WOULD BE VERY STRONG CONSIDERATIONS SAID LYDGATE HALFIRONICALLYSTILL THERE WAS A WITHERED PALENESS ABOUT HIS LIPS AS HELOOKED AT HIS COFFEE AND DID NOT DRINKTHESE WOULD BE VERY STRONGCONSIDERATIONS IF I DID NOT HAPPEN TO BE IN DEBT.MANY PERSONS MUST HAVE BEEN IN DEBT IN THE SAME WAY BUT IF THEY ARERESPECTABLE PEOPLE TRUST THEM. I AM SURE I HAVE HEARD PAPA SAY THATTHE TORBITS WERE IN DEBT AND THEY WENT ON VERY WELL. IT CANNOT BE GOODTO ACT RASHLY SAID ROSAMOND WITH SERENE WISDOM.LYDGATE SAT PARALYZED BY OPPOSING IMPULSES SINCE NO REASONING HE COULDAPPLY TO ROSAMOND SEEMED LIKELY TO CONQUER HER ASSENT HE WANTED TOSMASH AND GRIND SOME OBJECT ON WHICH HE COULD AT LEAST PRODUCE ANIMPRESSION OR ELSE TO TELL HER BRUTALLY THAT HE WAS MASTER AND SHEMUST OBEY. BUT HE NOT ONLY DREADED THE EFFECT OF SUCH EXTREMITIES ONTHEIR MUTUAL LIFEHE HAD A GROWING DREAD OF ROSAMONDS QUIET ELUSIVEOBSTINACY WHICH WOULD NOT ALLOW ANY ASSERTION OF POWER TO BE FINALAND AGAIN SHE HAD TOUCHED HIM IN A SPOT OF KEENEST FEELING BY IMPLYINGTHAT SHE HAD BEEN DELUDED WITH A FALSE VISION OF HAPPINESS IN MARRYINGHIM. AS TO SAYING THAT HE WAS MASTER IT WAS NOT THE FACT. THE VERYRESOLUTION TO WHICH HE HAD WROUGHT HIMSELF BY DINT OF LOGIC ANDHONORABLE PRIDE WAS BEGINNING TO RELAX UNDER HER TORPEDO CONTACT. HESWALLOWED HALF HIS CUP OF COFFEE AND THEN ROSE TO GO.I MAY AT LEAST REQUEST THAT YOU WILL NOT GO TO TRUMBULL ATPRESENTUNTIL IT HAS BEEN SEEN THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER MEANS SAIDROSAMOND. ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NOT SUBJECT TO MUCH FEAR SHE FELT IT SAFERNOT TO BETRAY THAT SHE HAD WRITTEN TO SIR GODWIN. PROMISE ME THAT YOUWILL NOT GO TO HIM FOR A FEW WEEKS OR WITHOUT TELLING ME.LYDGATE GAVE A SHORT LAUGH. I THINK IT IS I WHO SHOULD EXACT A PROMISETHAT YOU WILL DO NOTHING WITHOUT TELLING ME HE SAID TURNING HIS EYESSHARPLY UPON HER AND THEN MOVING TO THE DOOR.YOU REMEMBER THAT WE ARE GOING TO DINE AT PAPAS SAID ROSAMONDWISHING THAT HE SHOULD TURN AND MAKE A MORE THOROUGH CONCESSION TO HER.BUT HE ONLY SAID OH YES IMPATIENTLY AND WENT AWAY. SHE HELD IT TOBE VERY ODIOUS IN HIM THAT HE DID NOT THINK THE PAINFUL PROPOSITIONS HEHAD HAD TO MAKE TO HER WERE ENOUGH WITHOUT SHOWING SO UNPLEASANT ATEMPER. AND WHEN SHE PUT THE MODERATE REQUEST THAT HE WOULD DEFER GOINGTO TRUMBULL AGAIN IT WAS CRUEL IN HIM NOT TO ASSURE HER OF WHAT HEMEANT TO DO. SHE WAS CONVINCED OF HER HAVING ACTED IN EVERY WAY FOR THEBEST AND EACH GRATING OR ANGRY SPEECH OF LYDGATES SERVED ONLY AS ANADDITION TO THE REGISTER OF OFFENCES IN HER MIND. POOR ROSAMOND FORMONTHS HAD BEGUN TO ASSOCIATE HER HUSBAND WITH FEELINGS OFDISAPPOINTMENT AND THE TERRIBLY INFLEXIBLE RELATION OF MARRIAGE HADLOST ITS CHARM OF ENCOURAGING DELIGHTFUL DREAMS. IT HAD FREED HER FROMTHE DISAGREEABLES OF HER FATHERS HOUSE BUT IT HAD NOT GIVEN HEREVERYTHING THAT SHE HAD WISHED AND HOPED. THE LYDGATE WITH WHOM SHE HADBEEN IN LOVE HAD BEEN A GROUP OF AIRY CONDITIONS FOR HER MOST OF WHICHHAD DISAPPEARED WHILE THEIR PLACE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY EVERYDAY DETAILSWHICH MUST BE LIVED THROUGH SLOWLY FROM HOUR TO HOUR NOT FLOATEDTHROUGH WITH A RAPID SELECTION OF FAVORABLE ASPECTS. THE HABITS OFLYDGATES PROFESSION HIS HOME PREOCCUPATION WITH SCIENTIFIC SUBJECTSWHICH SEEMED TO HER ALMOST LIKE A MORBID VAMPIRES TASTE HIS PECULIARVIEWS OF THINGS WHICH HAD NEVER ENTERED INTO THE DIALOGUE OFCOURTSHIPALL THESE CONTINUALLY ALIENATING INFLUENCES EVEN WITHOUT THEFACT OF HIS HAVING PLACED HIMSELF AT A DISADVANTAGE IN THE TOWN ANDWITHOUT THAT FIRST SHOCK OF REVELATION ABOUT DOVERS DEBT WOULD HAVEMADE HIS PRESENCE DULL TO HER. THERE WAS ANOTHER PRESENCE WHICH EVERSINCE THE EARLY DAYS OF HER MARRIAGE UNTIL FOUR MONTHS AGO HAD BEENAN AGREEABLE EXCITEMENT BUT THAT WAS GONE ROSAMOND WOULD NOT CONFESSTO HERSELF HOW MUCH THE CONSEQUENT BLANK HAD TO DO WITH HER UTTERENNUI AND IT SEEMED TO HER PERHAPS SHE WAS RIGHT THAT AN INVITATIONTO QUALLINGHAM AND AN OPENING FOR LYDGATE TO SETTLE ELSEWHERE THAN INMIDDLEMARCHIN LONDON OR SOMEWHERE LIKELY TO BE FREE FROMUNPLEASANTNESSWOULD SATISFY HER QUITE WELL AND MAKE HER INDIFFERENTTO THE ABSENCE OF WILL LADISLAW TOWARDS WHOM SHE FELT SOME RESENTMENTFOR HIS EXALTATION OF MRS. CASAUBON.THAT WAS THE STATE OF THINGS WITH LYDGATE AND ROSAMOND ON THE NEWYEARS DAY WHEN THEY DINED AT HER FATHERS SHE LOOKING MILDLY NEUTRALTOWARDS HIM IN REMEMBRANCE OF HIS ILLTEMPERED BEHAVIOR AT BREAKFASTAND HE CARRYING A MUCH DEEPER EFFECT FROM THE INWARD CONFLICT IN WHICHTHAT MORNING SCENE WAS ONLY ONE OF MANY EPOCHS. HIS FLUSHED EFFORTWHILE TALKING TO MR. FAREBROTHERHIS EFFORT AFTER THE CYNICAL PRETENCETHAT ALL WAYS OF GETTING MONEY ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AND THATCHANCE HAS AN EMPIRE WHICH REDUCES CHOICE TO A FOOLS ILLUSIONWAS BUTTHE SYMPTOM OF A WAVERING RESOLVE A BENUMBED RESPONSE TO THE OLDSTIMULI OF ENTHUSIASM.WHAT WAS HE TO DO HE SAW EVEN MORE KEENLY THAN ROSAMOND DID THEDREARINESS OF TAKING HER INTO THE SMALL HOUSE IN BRIDE STREET WHERESHE WOULD HAVE SCANTY FURNITURE AROUND HER AND DISCONTENT WITHIN ALIFE OF PRIVATION AND LIFE WITH ROSAMOND WERE TWO IMAGES WHICH HADBECOME MORE AND MORE IRRECONCILABLE EVER SINCE THE THREAT OF PRIVATIONHAD DISCLOSED ITSELF. BUT EVEN IF HIS RESOLVES HAD FORCED THE TWOIMAGES INTO COMBINATION THE USEFUL PRELIMINARIES TO THAT HARD CHANGEWERE NOT VISIBLY WITHIN REACH. AND THOUGH HE HAD NOT GIVEN THE PROMISEWHICH HIS WIFE HAD ASKED FOR HE DID NOT GO AGAIN TO TRUMBULL. HE EVENBEGAN TO THINK OF TAKING A RAPID JOURNEY TO THE NORTH AND SEEING SIRGODWIN. HE HAD ONCE BELIEVED THAT NOTHING WOULD URGE HIM INTO MAKING ANAPPLICATION FOR MONEY TO HIS UNCLE BUT HE HAD NOT THEN KNOWN THE FULLPRESSURE OF ALTERNATIVES YET MORE DISAGREEABLE. HE COULD NOT DEPEND ONTHE EFFECT OF A LETTER IT WAS ONLY IN AN INTERVIEW HOWEVERDISAGREEABLE THIS MIGHT BE TO HIMSELF THAT HE COULD GIVE A THOROUGHEXPLANATION AND COULD TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF KINSHIP. NO SOONER HADLYDGATE BEGUN TO REPRESENT THIS STEP TO HIMSELF AS THE EASIEST THANTHERE WAS A REACTION OF ANGER THAT HEHE WHO HAD LONG AGO DETERMINED TOLIVE ALOOF FROM SUCH ABJECT CALCULATIONS SUCH SELFINTERESTED ANXIETYABOUT THE INCLINATIONS AND THE POCKETS OF MEN WITH WHOM HE HAD BEENPROUD TO HAVE NO AIMS IN COMMONSHOULD HAVE FALLEN NOT SIMPLY TO THEIRLEVEL BUT TO THE LEVEL OF SOLICITING THEM.CHAPTER LXV.ONE OF US TWO MUST BOWEN DOUTELESSAND SITH A MAN IS MORE REASONABLETHAN WOMAN IS YE MEN MOSTE BE SUFFRABLE.CHAUCER CANTERBURY TALES.THE BIAS OF HUMAN NATURE TO BE SLOW IN CORRESPONDENCE TRIUMPHS EVENOVER THE PRESENT QUICKENING IN THE GENERAL PACE OF THINGS WHAT WONDERTHEN THAT IN  OLD SIR GODWIN LYDGATE WAS SLOW TO WRITE A LETTERWHICH WAS OF CONSEQUENCE TO OTHERS RATHER THAN TO HIMSELF NEARLY THREEWEEKS OF THE NEW YEAR WERE GONE AND ROSAMOND AWAITING AN ANSWER TOHER WINNING APPEAL WAS EVERY DAY DISAPPOINTED. LYDGATE IN TOTALIGNORANCE OF HER EXPECTATIONS WAS SEEING THE BILLS COME IN ANDFEELING THAT DOVERS USE OF HIS ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER CREDITORS WASIMMINENT. HE HAD NEVER MENTIONED TO ROSAMOND HIS BROODING PURPOSE OFGOING TO QUALLINGHAM HE DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT WHAT WOULD APPEAR TO HERA CONCESSION TO HER WISHES AFTER INDIGNANT REFUSAL UNTIL THE LASTMOMENT BUT HE WAS REALLY EXPECTING TO SET OFF SOON. A SLICE OF THERAILWAY WOULD ENABLE HIM TO MANAGE THE WHOLE JOURNEY AND BACK IN FOURDAYS.BUT ONE MORNING AFTER LYDGATE HAD GONE OUT A LETTER CAME ADDRESSED TOHIM WHICH ROSAMOND SAW CLEARLY TO BE FROM SIR GODWIN. SHE WAS FULL OFHOPE. PERHAPS THERE MIGHT BE A PARTICULAR NOTE TO HER ENCLOSED BUTLYDGATE WAS NATURALLY ADDRESSED ON THE QUESTION OF MONEY OR OTHER AIDAND THE FACT THAT HE WAS WRITTEN TO NAY THE VERY DELAY IN WRITING ATALL SEEMED TO CERTIFY THAT THE ANSWER WAS THOROUGHLY COMPLIANT. SHEWAS TOO MUCH EXCITED BY THESE THOUGHTS TO DO ANYTHING BUT LIGHTSTITCHING IN A WARM CORNER OF THE DININGROOM WITH THE OUTSIDE OF THISMOMENTOUS LETTER LYING ON THE TABLE BEFORE HER. ABOUT TWELVE SHE HEARDHER HUSBANDS STEP IN THE PASSAGE AND TRIPPING TO OPEN THE DOOR SHESAID IN HER LIGHTEST TONES TERTIUS COME IN HEREHERE IS A LETTER FORYOU.AH HE SAID NOT TAKING OFF HIS HAT BUT JUST TURNING HER ROUNDWITHIN HIS ARM TO WALK TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE THE LETTER LAY. MY UNCLEGODWIN HE EXCLAIMED WHILE ROSAMOND RESEATED HERSELF AND WATCHED HIMAS HE OPENED THE LETTER. SHE HAD EXPECTED HIM TO BE SURPRISED.WHILE LYDGATES EYES GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER THE BRIEF LETTER SHE SAW HISFACE USUALLY OF A PALE BROWN TAKING ON A DRY WHITENESS WITH NOSTRILSAND LIPS QUIVERING HE TOSSED DOWN THE LETTER BEFORE HER AND SAIDVIOLENTLYIT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ENDURE LIFE WITH YOU IF YOU WILL ALWAYS BEACTING SECRETLYACTING IN OPPOSITION TO ME AND HIDING YOUR ACTIONS.HE CHECKED HIS SPEECH AND TURNED HIS BACK ON HERTHEN WHEELED ROUND ANDWALKED ABOUT SAT DOWN AND GOT UP AGAIN RESTLESSLY GRASPING HARD THEOBJECTS DEEP DOWN IN HIS POCKETS. HE WAS AFRAID OF SAYING SOMETHINGIRREMEDIABLY CRUEL.ROSAMOND TOO HAD CHANGED COLOR AS SHE READ. THE LETTER RAN IN THISWAYDEAR TERTIUSDONT SET YOUR WIFE TO WRITE TO ME WHEN YOU HAVEANYTHING TO ASK. IT IS A ROUNDABOUT WHEEDLING SORT OF THING WHICH ISHOULD NOT HAVE CREDITED YOU WITH. I NEVER CHOOSE TO WRITE TO A WOMANON MATTERS OF BUSINESS. AS TO MY SUPPLYING YOU WITH A THOUSAND POUNDSOR ONLY HALF THAT SUM I CAN DO NOTHING OF THE SORT. MY OWN FAMILYDRAINS ME TO THE LAST PENNY. WITH TWO YOUNGER SONS AND THREE DAUGHTERSI AM NOT LIKELY TO HAVE CASH TO SPARE. YOU SEEM TO HAVE GOT THROUGHYOUR OWN MONEY PRETTY QUICKLY AND TO HAVE MADE A MESS WHERE YOU ARETHE SOONER YOU GO SOMEWHERE ELSE THE BETTER. BUT I HAVE NOTHING TO DOWITH MEN OF YOUR PROFESSION AND CANT HELP YOU THERE. I DID THE BEST ICOULD FOR YOU AS GUARDIAN AND LET YOU HAVE YOUR OWN WAY IN TAKING TOMEDICINE. YOU MIGHT HAVE GONE INTO THE ARMY OR THE CHURCH. YOUR MONEYWOULD HAVE HELD OUT FOR THAT AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SURER LADDERBEFORE YOU. YOUR UNCLE CHARLES HAS HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST YOU FOR NOTGOING INTO HIS PROFESSION BUT NOT I. I HAVE ALWAYS WISHED YOU WELLBUT YOU MUST CONSIDER YOURSELF ON YOUR OWN LEGS ENTIRELY NOW.YOUR AFFECTIONATE UNCLEGODWIN LYDGATE.WHEN ROSAMOND HAD FINISHED READING THE LETTER SHE SAT QUITE STILL WITHHER HANDS FOLDED BEFORE HER RESTRAINING ANY SHOW OF HER KEENDISAPPOINTMENT AND INTRENCHING HERSELF IN QUIET PASSIVITY UNDER HERHUSBANDS WRATH. LYDGATE PAUSED IN HIS MOVEMENTS LOOKED AT HER AGAINAND SAID WITH BITING SEVERITYWILL THIS BE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE YOU OF THE HARM YOU MAY DO BY SECRETMEDDLING HAVE YOU SENSE ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE NOW YOUR INCOMPETENCE TOJUDGE AND ACT FOR METO INTERFERE WITH YOUR IGNORANCE IN AFFAIRS WHICHIT BELONGS TO ME TO DECIDE ONTHE WORDS WERE HARD BUT THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT LYDGATE HADBEEN FRUSTRATED BY HER. SHE DID NOT LOOK AT HIM AND MADE NO REPLY.I HAD NEARLY RESOLVED ON GOING TO QUALLINGHAM. IT WOULD HAVE COST MEPAIN ENOUGH TO DO IT YET IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OF SOME USE. BUT IT HASBEEN OF NO USE FOR ME TO THINK OF ANYTHING. YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEENCOUNTERACTING ME SECRETLY. YOU DELUDE ME WITH A FALSE ASSENT AND THENI AM AT THE MERCY OF YOUR DEVICES. IF YOU MEAN TO RESIST EVERY WISH IEXPRESS SAY SO AND DEFY ME. I SHALL AT LEAST KNOW WHAT I AM DOINGTHEN.IT IS A TERRIBLE MOMENT IN YOUNG LIVES WHEN THE CLOSENESS OF LOVESBOND HAS TURNED TO THIS POWER OF GALLING. IN SPITE OF ROSAMONDSSELFCONTROL A TEAR FELL SILENTLY AND ROLLED OVER HER LIPS. SHE STILLSAID NOTHING BUT UNDER THAT QUIETUDE WAS HIDDEN AN INTENSE EFFECT SHEWAS IN SUCH ENTIRE DISGUST WITH HER HUSBAND THAT SHE WISHED SHE HADNEVER SEEN HIM. SIR GODWINS RUDENESS TOWARDS HER AND UTTER WANT OFFEELING RANGED HIM WITH DOVER AND ALL OTHER CREDITORSDISAGREEABLEPEOPLE WHO ONLY THOUGHT OF THEMSELVES AND DID NOT MIND HOW ANNOYINGTHEY WERE TO HER. EVEN HER FATHER WAS UNKIND AND MIGHT HAVE DONE MOREFOR THEM. IN FACT THERE WAS BUT ONE PERSON IN ROSAMONDS WORLD WHOM SHEDID NOT REGARD AS BLAMEWORTHY AND THAT WAS THE GRACEFUL CREATURE WITHBLOND PLAITS AND WITH LITTLE HANDS CROSSED BEFORE HER WHO HAD NEVEREXPRESSED HERSELF UNBECOMINGLY AND HAD ALWAYS ACTED FOR THE BESTTHEBEST NATURALLY BEING WHAT SHE BEST LIKED.LYDGATE PAUSING AND LOOKING AT HER BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HALFMADDENINGSENSE OF HELPLESSNESS WHICH COMES OVER PASSIONATE PEOPLE WHEN THEIRPASSION IS MET BY AN INNOCENTLOOKING SILENCE WHOSE MEEK VICTIMIZED AIRSEEMS TO PUT THEM IN THE WRONG AND AT LAST INFECTS EVEN THE JUSTESTINDIGNATION WITH A DOUBT OF ITS JUSTICE. HE NEEDED TO RECOVER THE FULLSENSE THAT HE WAS IN THE RIGHT BY MODERATING HIS WORDS.CAN YOU NOT SEE ROSAMOND HE BEGAN AGAIN TRYING TO BE SIMPLY GRAVEAND NOT BITTER THAT NOTHING CAN BE SO FATAL AS A WANT OF OPENNESS ANDCONFIDENCE BETWEEN US IT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT I HAVEEXPRESSED A DECIDED WISH AND YOU HAVE SEEMED TO ASSENT YET AFTER THATYOU HAVE SECRETLY DISOBEYED MY WISH. IN THAT WAY I CAN NEVER KNOW WHATI HAVE TO TRUST TO. THERE WOULD BE SOME HOPE FOR US IF YOU WOULD ADMITTHIS. AM I SUCH AN UNREASONABLE FURIOUS BRUTE WHY SHOULD YOU NOT BEOPEN WITH ME STILL SILENCE.WILL YOU ONLY SAY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN AND THAT I MAY DEPENDON YOUR NOT ACTING SECRETLY IN FUTURE SAID LYDGATE URGENTLY BUTWITH SOMETHING OF REQUEST IN HIS TONE WHICH ROSAMOND WAS QUICK TOPERCEIVE. SHE SPOKE WITH COOLNESS.I CANNOT POSSIBLY MAKE ADMISSIONS OR PROMISES IN ANSWER TO SUCH WORDSAS YOU HAVE USED TOWARDS ME. I HAVE NOT BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LANGUAGE OFTHAT KIND. YOU HAVE SPOKEN OF MY SECRET MEDDLING AND MY INTERFERINGIGNORANCE AND MY FALSE ASSENT. I HAVE NEVER EXPRESSED MYSELF INTHAT WAY TO YOU AND I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO APOLOGIZE. YOU SPOKE OFITS BEING IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE WITH ME. CERTAINLY YOU HAVE NOT MADE MYLIFE PLEASANT TO ME OF LATE. I THINK IT WAS TO BE EXPECTED THAT ISHOULD TRY TO AVERT SOME OF THE HARDSHIPS WHICH OUR MARRIAGE HASBROUGHT ON ME. ANOTHER TEAR FELL AS ROSAMOND CEASED SPEAKING AND SHEPRESSED IT AWAY AS QUIETLY AS THE FIRST.LYDGATE FLUNG HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR FEELING CHECKMATED. WHAT PLACE WASTHERE IN HER MIND FOR A REMONSTRANCE TO LODGE IN HE LAID DOWN HIS HATFLUNG AN ARM OVER THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED DOWN FOR SOMEMOMENTS WITHOUT SPEAKING. ROSAMOND HAD THE DOUBLE PURCHASE OVER HIM OFINSENSIBILITY TO THE POINT OF JUSTICE IN HIS REPROACH AND OFSENSIBILITY TO THE UNDENIABLE HARDSHIPS NOW PRESENT IN HER MARRIEDLIFE. ALTHOUGH HER DUPLICITY IN THE AFFAIR OF THE HOUSE HAD EXCEEDEDWHAT HE KNEW AND HAD REALLY HINDERED THE PLYMDALES FROM KNOWING OF ITSHE HAD NO CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HER ACTION COULD RIGHTLY BE CALLED FALSE.WE ARE NOT OBLIGED TO IDENTIFY OUR OWN ACTS ACCORDING TO A STRICTCLASSIFICATION ANY MORE THAN THE MATERIALS OF OUR GROCERY AND CLOTHES.ROSAMOND FELT THAT SHE WAS AGGRIEVED AND THAT THIS WAS WHAT LYDGATEHAD TO RECOGNIZE.AS FOR HIM THE NEED OF ACCOMMODATING HIMSELF TO HER NATURE WHICH WASINFLEXIBLE IN PROPORTION TO ITS NEGATIONS HELD HIM AS WITH PINCERS. HEHAD BEGUN TO HAVE AN ALARMED FORESIGHT OF HER IRREVOCABLE LOSS OF LOVEFOR HIM AND THE CONSEQUENT DREARINESS OF THEIR LIFE. THE READY FULNESSOF HIS EMOTIONS MADE THIS DREAD ALTERNATE QUICKLY WITH THE FIRSTVIOLENT MOVEMENTS OF HIS ANGER. IT WOULD ASSUREDLY HAVE BEEN A VAINBOAST IN HIM TO SAY THAT HE WAS HER MASTER.YOU HAVE NOT MADE MY LIFE PLEASANT TO ME OF LATETHE HARDSHIPS WHICHOUR MARRIAGE HAS BROUGHT ON METHESE WORDS WERE STINGING HISIMAGINATION AS A PAIN MAKES AN EXAGGERATED DREAM. IF HE WERE NOT ONLYTO SINK FROM HIS HIGHEST RESOLVE BUT TO SINK INTO THE HIDEOUSFETTERING OF DOMESTIC HATEROSAMOND HE SAID TURNING HIS EYES ON HER WITH A MELANCHOLY LOOKYOU SHOULD ALLOW FOR A MANS WORDS WHEN HE IS DISAPPOINTED ANDPROVOKED. YOU AND I CANNOT HAVE OPPOSITE INTERESTS. I CANNOT PART MYHAPPINESS FROM YOURS. IF I AM ANGRY WITH YOU IT IS THAT YOU SEEM NOTTO SEE HOW ANY CONCEALMENT DIVIDES US. HOW COULD I WISH TO MAKEANYTHING HARD TO YOU EITHER BY MY WORDS OR CONDUCT WHEN I HURT YOU IHURT PART OF MY OWN LIFE. I SHOULD NEVER BE ANGRY WITH YOU IF YOU WOULDBE QUITE OPEN WITH ME.I HAVE ONLY WISHED TO PREVENT YOU FROM HURRYING US INTO WRETCHEDNESSWITHOUT ANY NECESSITY SAID ROSAMOND THE TEARS COMING AGAIN FROM ASOFTENED FEELING NOW THAT HER HUSBAND HAD SOFTENED. IT IS SO VERY HARDTO BE DISGRACED HERE AMONG ALL THE PEOPLE WE KNOW AND TO LIVE IN SUCHA MISERABLE WAY. I WISH I HAD DIED WITH THE BABY.SHE SPOKE AND WEPT WITH THAT GENTLENESS WHICH MAKES SUCH WORDS ANDTEARS OMNIPOTENT OVER A LOVINGHEARTED MAN. LYDGATE DREW HIS CHAIR NEARTO HERS AND PRESSED HER DELICATE HEAD AGAINST HIS CHEEK WITH HISPOWERFUL TENDER HAND. HE ONLY CARESSED HER HE DID NOT SAY ANYTHINGFOR WHAT WAS THERE TO SAY HE COULD NOT PROMISE TO SHIELD HER FROM THEDREADED WRETCHEDNESS FOR HE COULD SEE NO SURE MEANS OF DOING SO. WHENHE LEFT HER TO GO OUT AGAIN HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IT WAS TEN TIMESHARDER FOR HER THAN FOR HIM HE HAD A LIFE AWAY FROM HOME AND CONSTANTAPPEALS TO HIS ACTIVITY ON BEHALF OF OTHERS. HE WISHED TO EXCUSEEVERYTHING IN HER IF HE COULDBUT IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT IN THATEXCUSING MOOD HE SHOULD THINK OF HER AS IF SHE WERE AN ANIMAL OFANOTHER AND FEEBLER SPECIES. NEVERTHELESS SHE HAD MASTERED HIM.CHAPTER LXVI.TIS ONE THING TO BE TEMPTED ESCALUSANOTHER THING TO FALL.MEASURE FOR MEASURE.LYDGATE CERTAINLY HAD GOOD REASON TO REFLECT ON THE SERVICE HISPRACTICE DID HIM IN COUNTERACTING HIS PERSONAL CARES. HE HAD NO LONGERFREE ENERGY ENOUGH FOR SPONTANEOUS RESEARCH AND SPECULATIVE THINKINGBUT BY THE BEDSIDE OF PATIENTS THE DIRECT EXTERNAL CALLS ON HISJUDGMENT AND SYMPATHIES BROUGHT THE ADDED IMPULSE NEEDED TO DRAW HIMOUT OF HIMSELF. IT WAS NOT SIMPLY THAT BENEFICENT HARNESS OF ROUTINEWHICH ENABLES SILLY MEN TO LIVE RESPECTABLY AND UNHAPPY MEN TO LIVECALMLYIT WAS A PERPETUAL CLAIM ON THE IMMEDIATE FRESH APPLICATION OFTHOUGHT AND ON THE CONSIDERATION OF ANOTHERS NEED AND TRIAL. MANY OFUS LOOKING BACK THROUGH LIFE WOULD SAY THAT THE KINDEST MAN WE HAVEEVER KNOWN HAS BEEN A MEDICAL MAN OR PERHAPS THAT SURGEON WHOSE FINETACT DIRECTED BY DEEPLY INFORMED PERCEPTION HAS COME TO US IN OURNEED WITH A MORE SUBLIME BENEFICENCE THAN THAT OF MIRACLEWORKERS. SOMEOF THAT TWICEBLESSED MERCY WAS ALWAYS WITH LYDGATE IN HIS WORK AT THEHOSPITAL OR IN PRIVATE HOUSES SERVING BETTER THAN ANY OPIATE TO QUIETAND SUSTAIN HIM UNDER HIS ANXIETIES AND HIS SENSE OF MENTAL DEGENERACY.MR. FAREBROTHERS SUSPICION AS TO THE OPIATE WAS TRUE HOWEVER. UNDERTHE FIRST GALLING PRESSURE OF FORESEEN DIFFICULTIES AND THE FIRSTPERCEPTION THAT HIS MARRIAGE IF IT WERE NOT TO BE A YOKED LONELINESSMUST BE A STATE OF EFFORT TO GO ON LOVING WITHOUT TOO MUCH CARE ABOUTBEING LOVED HE HAD ONCE OR TWICE TRIED A DOSE OF OPIUM. BUT HE HAD NOHEREDITARY CONSTITUTIONAL CRAVING AFTER SUCH TRANSIENT ESCAPES FROM THEHAUNTINGS OF MISERY. HE WAS STRONG COULD DRINK A GREAT DEAL OF WINEBUT DID NOT CARE ABOUT IT AND WHEN THE MEN ROUND HIM WERE DRINKINGSPIRITS HE TOOK SUGAR AND WATER HAVING A CONTEMPTUOUS PITY EVEN FORTHE EARLIEST STAGES OF EXCITEMENT FROM DRINK. IT WAS THE SAME WITHGAMBLING. HE HAD LOOKED ON AT A GREAT DEAL OF GAMBLING IN PARISWATCHING IT AS IF IT HAD BEEN A DISEASE. HE WAS NO MORE TEMPTED BY SUCHWINNING THAN HE WAS BY DRINK. HE HAD SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THE ONLYWINNING HE CARED FOR MUST BE ATTAINED BY A CONSCIOUS PROCESS OF HIGHDIFFICULT COMBINATION TENDING TOWARDS A BENEFICENT RESULT. THE POWER HELONGED FOR COULD NOT BE REPRESENTED BY AGITATED FINGERS CLUTCHING AHEAP OF COIN OR BY THE HALFBARBAROUS HALFIDIOTIC TRIUMPH IN THEEYES OF A MAN WHO SWEEPS WITHIN HIS ARMS THE VENTURES OF TWENTYCHAPFALLEN COMPANIONS.BUT JUST AS HE HAD TRIED OPIUM SO HIS THOUGHT NOW BEGAN TO TURN UPONGAMBLINGNOT WITH APPETITE FOR ITS EXCITEMENT BUT WITH A SORT OFWISTFUL INWARD GAZE AFTER THAT EASY WAY OF GETTING MONEY WHICH IMPLIEDNO ASKING AND BROUGHT NO RESPONSIBILITY. IF HE HAD BEEN IN LONDON ORPARIS AT THAT TIME IT IS PROBABLE THAT SUCH THOUGHTS SECONDED BYOPPORTUNITY WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM INTO A GAMBLINGHOUSE NO LONGER TOWATCH THE GAMBLERS BUT TO WATCH WITH THEM IN KINDRED EAGERNESS.REPUGNANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN SURMOUNTED BY THE IMMENSE NEED TO WIN IFCHANCE WOULD BE KIND ENOUGH TO LET HIM. AN INCIDENT WHICH HAPPENED NOTVERY LONG AFTER THAT AIRY NOTION OF GETTING AID FROM HIS UNCLE HAD BEENEXCLUDED WAS A STRONG SIGN OF THE EFFECT THAT MIGHT HAVE FOLLOWED ANYEXTANT OPPORTUNITY OF GAMBLING.THE BILLIARDROOM AT THE GREEN DRAGON WAS THE CONSTANT RESORT OF ACERTAIN SET MOST OF WHOM LIKE OUR ACQUAINTANCE MR. BAMBRIDGE WEREREGARDED AS MEN OF PLEASURE. IT WAS HERE THAT POOR FRED VINCY HAD MADEPART OF HIS MEMORABLE DEBT HAVING LOST MONEY IN BETTING AND BEENOBLIGED TO BORROW OF THAT GAY COMPANION. IT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN INMIDDLEMARCH THAT A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY WAS LOST AND WON IN THIS WAY ANDTHE CONSEQUENT REPUTE OF THE GREEN DRAGON AS A PLACE OF DISSIPATIONNATURALLY HEIGHTENED IN SOME QUARTERS THE TEMPTATION TO GO THERE.PROBABLY ITS REGULAR VISITANTS LIKE THE INITIATES OF FREEMASONRYWISHED THAT THERE WERE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE TREMENDOUS TO KEEP TOTHEMSELVES CONCERNING IT BUT THEY WERE NOT A CLOSED COMMUNITY ANDMANY DECENT SENIORS AS WELL AS JUNIORS OCCASIONALLY TURNED INTO THEBILLIARDROOM TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON. LYDGATE WHO HAD THE MUSCULARAPTITUDE FOR BILLIARDS AND WAS FOND OF THE GAME HAD ONCE OR TWICE INTHE EARLY DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN MIDDLEMARCH TAKEN HIS TURN WITH THECUE AT THE GREEN DRAGON BUT AFTERWARDS HE HAD NO LEISURE FOR THE GAMEAND NO INCLINATION FOR THE SOCIALITIES THERE. ONE EVENING HOWEVER HEHAD OCCASION TO SEEK MR. BAMBRIDGE AT THAT RESORT. THE HORSEDEALER HADENGAGED TO GET HIM A CUSTOMER FOR HIS REMAINING GOOD HORSE FOR WHICHLYDGATE HAD DETERMINED TO SUBSTITUTE A CHEAP HACK HOPING BY THISREDUCTION OF STYLE TO GET PERHAPS TWENTY POUNDS AND HE CARED NOW FOREVERY SMALL SUM AS A HELP TOWARDS FEEDING THE PATIENCE OF HISTRADESMEN. TO RUN UP TO THE BILLIARDROOM AS HE WAS PASSING WOULDSAVE TIME.MR. BAMBRIDGE WAS NOT YET COME BUT WOULD BE SURE TO ARRIVE BYANDBYSAID HIS FRIEND MR. HORROCK AND LYDGATE STAYED PLAYING A GAME FOR THESAKE OF PASSING THE TIME. THAT EVENING HE HAD THE PECULIAR LIGHT IN THEEYES AND THE UNUSUAL VIVACITY WHICH HAD BEEN ONCE NOTICED IN HIM BY MR.FAREBROTHER. THE EXCEPTIONAL FACT OF HIS PRESENCE WAS MUCH NOTICED INTHE ROOM WHERE THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF MIDDLEMARCH COMPANY ANDSEVERAL LOOKERSON AS WELL AS SOME OF THE PLAYERS WERE BETTING WITHANIMATION. LYDGATE WAS PLAYING WELL AND FELT CONFIDENT THE BETS WEREDROPPING ROUND HIM AND WITH A SWIFT GLANCING THOUGHT OF THE PROBABLEGAIN WHICH MIGHT DOUBLE THE SUM HE WAS SAVING FROM HIS HORSE HE BEGANTO BET ON HIS OWN PLAY AND WON AGAIN AND AGAIN. MR. BAMBRIDGE HAD COMEIN BUT LYDGATE DID NOT NOTICE HIM. HE WAS NOT ONLY EXCITED WITH HISPLAY BUT VISIONS WERE GLEAMING ON HIM OF GOING THE NEXT DAY TOBRASSING WHERE THERE WAS GAMBLING ON A GRANDER SCALE TO BE HAD ANDWHERE BY ONE POWERFUL SNATCH AT THE DEVILS BAIT HE MIGHT CARRY ITOFF WITHOUT THE HOOK AND BUY HIS RESCUE FROM HIS DAILY SOLICITINGS.HE WAS STILL WINNING WHEN TWO NEW VISITORS ENTERED. ONE OF THEM WAS AYOUNG HAWLEY JUST COME FROM HIS LAW STUDIES IN TOWN AND THE OTHER WASFRED VINCY WHO HAD SPENT SEVERAL EVENINGS OF LATE AT THIS OLD HAUNT OFHIS. YOUNG HAWLEY AN ACCOMPLISHED BILLIARDPLAYER BROUGHT A COOLFRESH HAND TO THE CUE. BUT FRED VINCY STARTLED AT SEEING LYDGATE ANDASTONISHED TO SEE HIM BETTING WITH AN EXCITED AIR STOOD ASIDE ANDKEPT OUT OF THE CIRCLE ROUND THE TABLE.FRED HAD BEEN REWARDING RESOLUTION BY A LITTLE LAXITY OF LATE. HE HADBEEN WORKING HEARTILY FOR SIX MONTHS AT ALL OUTDOOR OCCUPATIONS UNDERMR. GARTH AND BY DINT OF SEVERE PRACTICE HAD NEARLY MASTERED THEDEFECTS OF HIS HANDWRITING THIS PRACTICE BEING PERHAPS A LITTLE THELESS SEVERE THAT IT WAS OFTEN CARRIED ON IN THE EVENING AT MR. GARTHSUNDER THE EYES OF MARY. BUT THE LAST FORTNIGHT MARY HAD BEEN STAYING ATLOWICK PARSONAGE WITH THE LADIES THERE DURING MR. FAREBROTHERSRESIDENCE IN MIDDLEMARCH WHERE HE WAS CARRYING OUT SOME PAROCHIALPLANS AND FRED NOT SEEING ANYTHING MORE AGREEABLE TO DO HAD TURNEDINTO THE GREEN DRAGON PARTLY TO PLAY AT BILLIARDS PARTLY TO TASTE THEOLD FLAVOR OF DISCOURSE ABOUT HORSES SPORT AND THINGS IN GENERALCONSIDERED FROM A POINT OF VIEW WHICH WAS NOT STRENUOUSLY CORRECT. HEHAD NOT BEEN OUT HUNTING ONCE THIS SEASON HAD HAD NO HORSE OF HIS OWNTO RIDE AND HAD GONE FROM PLACE TO PLACE CHIEFLY WITH MR. GARTH IN HISGIG OR ON THE SOBER COB WHICH MR. GARTH COULD LEND HIM. IT WAS ALITTLE TOO BAD FRED BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE SHOULD BE KEPT IN THETRACES WITH MORE SEVERITY THAN IF HE HAD BEEN A CLERGYMAN. I WILL TELLYOU WHAT MISTRESS MARYIT WILL BE RATHER HARDER WORK TO LEARNSURVEYING AND DRAWING PLANS THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO WRITE SERMONSHE HAD SAID WISHING HER TO APPRECIATE WHAT HE WENT THROUGH FOR HERSAKE AND AS TO HERCULES AND THESEUS THEY WERE NOTHING TO ME. THEYHAD SPORT AND NEVER LEARNED TO WRITE A BOOKKEEPING HAND. AND NOWMARY BEING OUT OF THE WAY FOR A LITTLE WHILE FRED LIKE ANY OTHERSTRONG DOG WHO CANNOT SLIP HIS COLLAR HAD PULLED UP THE STAPLE OF HISCHAIN AND MADE A SMALL ESCAPE NOT OF COURSE MEANING TO GO FAST OR FAR.THERE COULD BE NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD NOT PLAY AT BILLIARDS BUT HEWAS DETERMINED NOT TO BET. AS TO MONEY JUST NOW FRED HAD IN HIS MINDTHE HEROIC PROJECT OF SAVING ALMOST ALL OF THE EIGHTY POUNDS THAT MR.GARTH OFFERED HIM AND RETURNING IT WHICH HE COULD EASILY DO BY GIVINGUP ALL FUTILE MONEYSPENDING SINCE HE HAD A SUPERFLUOUS STOCK OFCLOTHES AND NO EXPENSE IN HIS BOARD. IN THAT WAY HE COULD IN ONEYEAR GO A GOOD WAY TOWARDS REPAYING THE NINETY POUNDS OF WHICH HE HADDEPRIVED MRS. GARTH UNHAPPILY AT A TIME WHEN SHE NEEDED THAT SUM MORETHAN SHE DID NOW. NEVERTHELESS IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ON THISEVENING WHICH WAS THE FIFTH OF HIS RECENT VISITS TO THE BILLIARDROOMFRED HAD NOT IN HIS POCKET BUT IN HIS MIND THE TEN POUNDS WHICH HEMEANT TO RESERVE FOR HIMSELF FROM HIS HALFYEARS SALARY HAVING BEFOREHIM THE PLEASURE OF CARRYING THIRTY TO MRS. GARTH WHEN MARY WAS LIKELYTO BE COME HOME AGAINHE HAD THOSE TEN POUNDS IN HIS MIND AS A FUNDFROM WHICH HE MIGHT RISK SOMETHING IF THERE WERE A CHANCE OF A GOODBET. WHY WELL WHEN SOVEREIGNS WERE FLYING ABOUT WHY SHOULDNT HECATCH A FEW HE WOULD NEVER GO FAR ALONG THAT ROAD AGAIN BUT A MANLIKES TO ASSURE HIMSELF AND MEN OF PLEASURE GENERALLY WHAT HE COULDDO IN THE WAY OF MISCHIEF IF HE CHOSE AND THAT IF HE ABSTAINS FROMMAKING HIMSELF ILL OR BEGGARING HIMSELF OR TALKING WITH THE UTMOSTLOOSENESS WHICH THE NARROW LIMITS OF HUMAN CAPACITY WILL ALLOW IT ISNOT BECAUSE HE IS A SPOONEY. FRED DID NOT ENTER INTO FORMAL REASONSWHICH ARE A VERY ARTIFICIAL INEXACT WAY OF REPRESENTING THE TINGLINGRETURNS OF OLD HABIT AND THE CAPRICES OF YOUNG BLOOD BUT THERE WASLURKING IN HIM A PROPHETIC SENSE THAT EVENING THAT WHEN HE BEGAN TOPLAY HE SHOULD ALSO BEGIN TO BETTHAT HE SHOULD ENJOY SOMEPUNCHDRINKING AND IN GENERAL PREPARE HIMSELF FOR FEELING RATHERSEEDY IN THE MORNING. IT IS IN SUCH INDEFINABLE MOVEMENTS THAT ACTIONOFTEN BEGINS.BUT THE LAST THING LIKELY TO HAVE ENTERED FREDS EXPECTATION WAS THATHE SHOULD SEE HIS BROTHERINLAW LYDGATEOF WHOM HE HAD NEVER QUITEDROPPED THE OLD OPINION THAT HE WAS A PRIG AND TREMENDOUSLY CONSCIOUSOF HIS SUPERIORITYLOOKING EXCITED AND BETTING JUST AS HE HIMSELFMIGHT HAVE DONE. FRED FELT A SHOCK GREATER THAN HE COULD QUITE ACCOUNTFOR BY THE VAGUE KNOWLEDGE THAT LYDGATE WAS IN DEBT AND THAT HISFATHER HAD REFUSED TO HELP HIM AND HIS OWN INCLINATION TO ENTER INTOTHE PLAY WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED. IT WAS A STRANGE REVERSAL OF ATTITUDESFREDS BLOND FACE AND BLUE EYES USUALLY BRIGHT AND CARELESS READY TOGIVE ATTENTION TO ANYTHING THAT HELD OUT A PROMISE OF AMUSEMENTLOOKING INVOLUNTARILY GRAVE AND ALMOST EMBARRASSED AS IF BY THE SIGHTOF SOMETHING UNFITTING WHILE LYDGATE WHO HAD HABITUALLY AN AIR OFSELFPOSSESSED STRENGTH AND A CERTAIN MEDITATIVENESS THAT SEEMED TOLIE BEHIND HIS MOST OBSERVANT ATTENTION WAS ACTING WATCHING SPEAKINGWITH THAT EXCITED NARROW CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH REMINDS ONE OF AN ANIMALWITH FIERCE EYES AND RETRACTILE CLAWS.LYDGATE BY BETTING ON HIS OWN STROKES HAD WON SIXTEEN POUNDS BUTYOUNG HAWLEYS ARRIVAL HAD CHANGED THE POISE OF THINGS. HE MADEFIRSTRATE STROKES HIMSELF AND BEGAN TO BET AGAINST LYDGATES STROKESTHE STRAIN OF WHOSE NERVES WAS THUS CHANGED FROM SIMPLE CONFIDENCE INHIS OWN MOVEMENTS TO DEFYING ANOTHER PERSONS DOUBT IN THEM. THEDEFIANCE WAS MORE EXCITING THAN THE CONFIDENCE BUT IT WAS LESS SURE.HE CONTINUED TO BET ON HIS OWN PLAY BUT BEGAN OFTEN TO FAIL. STILL HEWENT ON FOR HIS MIND WAS AS UTTERLY NARROWED INTO THAT PRECIPITOUSCREVICE OF PLAY AS IF HE HAD BEEN THE MOST IGNORANT LOUNGER THERE. FREDOBSERVED THAT LYDGATE WAS LOSING FAST AND FOUND HIMSELF IN THE NEWSITUATION OF PUZZLING HIS BRAINS TO THINK OF SOME DEVICE BY WHICHWITHOUT BEING OFFENSIVE HE COULD WITHDRAW LYDGATES ATTENTION ANDPERHAPS SUGGEST TO HIM A REASON FOR QUITTING THE ROOM. HE SAW THATOTHERS WERE OBSERVING LYDGATES STRANGE UNLIKENESS TO HIMSELF AND ITOCCURRED TO HIM THAT MERELY TO TOUCH HIS ELBOW AND CALL HIM ASIDE FOR AMOMENT MIGHT ROUSE HIM FROM HIS ABSORPTION. HE COULD THINK OF NOTHINGCLEVERER THAN THE DARING IMPROBABILITY OF SAYING THAT HE WANTED TO SEEROSY AND WISHED TO KNOW IF SHE WERE AT HOME THIS EVENING AND HE WASGOING DESPERATELY TO CARRY OUT THIS WEAK DEVICE WHEN A WAITER CAME UPTO HIM WITH A MESSAGE SAYING THAT MR. FAREBROTHER WAS BELOW ANDBEGGED TO SPEAK WITH HIM.FRED WAS SURPRISED NOT QUITE COMFORTABLY BUT SENDING WORD THAT HEWOULD BE DOWN IMMEDIATELY HE WENT WITH A NEW IMPULSE UP TO LYDGATESAID CAN I SPEAK TO YOU A MOMENT AND DREW HIM ASIDE.FAREBROTHER HAS JUST SENT UP A MESSAGE TO SAY THAT HE WANTS TO SPEAKTO ME. HE IS BELOW. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO KNOW HE WAS THERE IFYOU HAD ANYTHING TO SAY TO HIM.FRED HAD SIMPLY SNATCHED UP THIS PRETEXT FOR SPEAKING BECAUSE HE COULDNOT SAY YOU ARE LOSING CONFOUNDEDLY AND ARE MAKING EVERYBODY STAREAT YOU YOU HAD BETTER COME AWAY. BUT INSPIRATION COULD HARDLY HAVESERVED HIM BETTER. LYDGATE HAD NOT BEFORE SEEN THAT FRED WAS PRESENTAND HIS SUDDEN APPEARANCE WITH AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF MR. FAREBROTHER HADTHE EFFECT OF A SHARP CONCUSSION.NO NO SAID LYDGATE I HAVE NOTHING PARTICULAR TO SAY TO HIM.BUTTHE GAME IS UPI MUST BE GOINGI CAME IN JUST TO SEE BAMBRIDGE.BAMBRIDGE IS OVER THERE BUT HE IS MAKING A ROWI DONT THINK HESREADY FOR BUSINESS. COME DOWN WITH ME TO FAREBROTHER. I EXPECT HE ISGOING TO BLOW ME UP AND YOU WILL SHIELD ME SAID FRED WITH SOMEADROITNESS.LYDGATE FELT SHAME BUT COULD NOT BEAR TO ACT AS IF HE FELT IT BYREFUSING TO SEE MR. FAREBROTHER AND HE WENT DOWN. THEY MERELY SHOOKHANDS HOWEVER AND SPOKE OF THE FROST AND WHEN ALL THREE HAD TURNEDINTO THE STREET THE VICAR SEEMED QUITE WILLING TO SAY GOODBY TOLYDGATE. HIS PRESENT PURPOSE WAS CLEARLY TO TALK WITH FRED ALONE ANDHE SAID KINDLY I DISTURBED YOU YOUNG GENTLEMAN BECAUSE I HAVE SOMEPRESSING BUSINESS WITH YOU. WALK WITH ME TO ST. BOTOLPHS WILL YOUIT WAS A FINE NIGHT THE SKY THICK WITH STARS AND MR. FAREBROTHERPROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE A CIRCUIT TO THE OLD CHURCH BY THELONDON ROAD. THE NEXT THING HE SAID WASI THOUGHT LYDGATE NEVER WENT TO THE GREEN DRAGONSO DID I SAID FRED. BUT HE SAID THAT HE WENT TO SEE BAMBRIDGE.HE WAS NOT PLAYING THENFRED HAD NOT MEANT TO TELL THIS BUT HE WAS OBLIGED NOW TO SAY YESHE WAS. BUT I SUPPOSE IT WAS AN ACCIDENTAL THING. I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIMTHERE BEFORE.YOU HAVE BEEN GOING OFTEN YOURSELF THEN LATELYOH ABOUT FIVE OR SIX TIMES.I THINK YOU HAD SOME GOOD REASON FOR GIVING UP THE HABIT OF GOINGTHEREYES. YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT SAID FRED NOT LIKING TO BE CATECHISED INTHIS WAY. I MADE A CLEAN BREAST TO YOU.I SUPPOSE THAT GIVES ME A WARRANT TO SPEAK ABOUT THE MATTER NOW. IT ISUNDERSTOOD BETWEEN US IS IT NOTTHAT WE ARE ON A FOOTING OF OPENFRIENDSHIP I HAVE LISTENED TO YOU AND YOU WILL BE WILLING TO LISTENTO ME. I MAY TAKE MY TURN IN TALKING A LITTLE ABOUT MYSELFI AM UNDER THE DEEPEST OBLIGATION TO YOU MR. FAREBROTHER SAID FREDIN A STATE OF UNCOMFORTABLE SURMISE.I WILL NOT AFFECT TO DENY THAT YOU ARE UNDER SOME OBLIGATION TO ME.BUT I AM GOING TO CONFESS TO YOU FRED THAT I HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TOREVERSE ALL THAT BY KEEPING SILENCE WITH YOU JUST NOW. WHEN SOMEBODYSAID TO ME YOUNG VINCY HAS TAKEN TO BEING AT THE BILLIARDTABLE EVERYNIGHT AGAINHE WONT BEAR THE CURB LONG I WAS TEMPTED TO DO THEOPPOSITE OF WHAT I AM DOINGTO HOLD MY TONGUE AND WAIT WHILE YOU WENTDOWN THE LADDER AGAIN BETTING FIRST AND THENI HAVE NOT MADE ANY BETS SAID FRED HASTILY.GLAD TO HEAR IT. BUT I SAY MY PROMPTING WAS TO LOOK ON AND SEE YOUTAKE THE WRONG TURNING WEAR OUT GARTHS PATIENCE AND LOSE THE BESTOPPORTUNITY OF YOUR LIFETHE OPPORTUNITY WHICH YOU MADE SOME RATHERDIFFICULT EFFORT TO SECURE. YOU CAN GUESS THE FEELING WHICH RAISED THATTEMPTATION IN MEI AM SURE YOU KNOW IT. I AM SURE YOU KNOW THAT THESATISFACTION OF YOUR AFFECTIONS STANDS IN THE WAY OF MINE.THERE WAS A PAUSE. MR. FAREBROTHER SEEMED TO WAIT FOR A RECOGNITION OFTHE FACT AND THE EMOTION PERCEPTIBLE IN THE TONES OF HIS FINE VOICEGAVE SOLEMNITY TO HIS WORDS. BUT NO FEELING COULD QUELL FREDS ALARM.I COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO GIVE HER UP HE SAID AFTER A MOMENTSHESITATION IT WAS NOT A CASE FOR ANY PRETENCE OF GENEROSITY.CLEARLY NOT WHEN HER AFFECTION MET YOURS. BUT RELATIONS OF THIS SORTEVEN WHEN THEY ARE OF LONG STANDING ARE ALWAYS LIABLE TO CHANGE. I CANEASILY CONCEIVE THAT YOU MIGHT ACT IN A WAY TO LOOSEN THE TIE SHE FEELSTOWARDS YOUIT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT SHE IS ONLY CONDITIONALLY BOUNDTO YOUAND THAT IN THAT CASE ANOTHER MAN WHO MAY FLATTER HIMSELF THATHE HAS A HOLD ON HER REGARD MIGHT SUCCEED IN WINNING THAT FIRM PLACEIN HER LOVE AS WELL AS RESPECT WHICH YOU HAD LET SLIP. I CAN EASILYCONCEIVE SUCH A RESULT REPEATED MR. FAREBROTHER EMPHATICALLY. THEREIS A COMPANIONSHIP OF READY SYMPATHY WHICH MIGHT GET THE ADVANTAGEEVEN OVER THE LONGEST ASSOCIATIONS. IT SEEMED TO FRED THAT IF MR.FAREBROTHER HAD HAD A BEAK AND TALONS INSTEAD OF HIS VERY CAPABLETONGUE HIS MODE OF ATTACK COULD HARDLY BE MORE CRUEL. HE HAD AHORRIBLE CONVICTION THAT BEHIND ALL THIS HYPOTHETIC STATEMENT THERE WASA KNOWLEDGE OF SOME ACTUAL CHANGE IN MARYS FEELING.OF COURSE I KNOW IT MIGHT EASILY BE ALL UP WITH ME HE SAID IN ATROUBLED VOICE. IF SHE IS BEGINNING TO COMPARE HE BROKE OFF NOTLIKING TO BETRAY ALL HE FELT AND THEN SAID BY THE HELP OF A LITTLEBITTERNESS BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE FRIENDLY TO ME.SO I AM THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE. BUT I HAVE HAD A STRONG DISPOSITIONTO BE OTHERWISE. I HAVE SAID TO MYSELF IF THERE IS A LIKELIHOOD OFTHAT YOUNGSTER DOING HIMSELF HARM WHY SHOULD YOU INTERFERE ARENT YOUWORTH AS MUCH AS HE IS AND DONT YOUR SIXTEEN YEARS OVER AND ABOVEHIS IN WHICH YOU HAVE GONE RATHER HUNGRY GIVE YOU MORE RIGHT TOSATISFACTION THAN HE HAS IF THERES A CHANCE OF HIS GOING TO THE DOGSLET HIMPERHAPS YOU COULD NOHOW HINDER ITAND DO YOU TAKE THEBENEFIT.THERE WAS A PAUSE IN WHICH FRED WAS SEIZED BY A MOST UNCOMFORTABLECHILL. WHAT WAS COMING NEXT HE DREADED TO HEAR THAT SOMETHING HAD BEENSAID TO MARYHE FELT AS IF HE WERE LISTENING TO A THREAT RATHER THAN AWARNING. WHEN THE VICAR BEGAN AGAIN THERE WAS A CHANGE IN HIS TONE LIKETHE ENCOURAGING TRANSITION TO A MAJOR KEY.BUT I HAD ONCE MEANT BETTER THAN THAT AND I AM COME BACK TO MY OLDINTENTION. I THOUGHT THAT I COULD HARDLY SECURE MYSELF IN IT BETTERFRED THAN BY TELLING YOU JUST WHAT HAD GONE ON IN ME. AND NOW DO YOUUNDERSTAND ME I WANT YOU TO MAKE THE HAPPINESS OF HER LIFE AND YOUROWN AND IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE THAT A WORD OF WARNING FROM ME MAY TURNASIDE ANY RISK TO THE CONTRARYWELL I HAVE UTTERED IT.THERE WAS A DROP IN THE VICARS VOICE WHEN HE SPOKE THE LAST WORDS. HEPAUSEDTHEY WERE STANDING ON A PATCH OF GREEN WHERE THE ROAD DIVERGEDTOWARDS ST. BOTOLPHS AND HE PUT OUT HIS HAND AS IF TO IMPLY THAT THECONVERSATION WAS CLOSED. FRED WAS MOVED QUITE NEWLY. SOME ONE HIGHLYSUSCEPTIBLE TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF A FINE ACT HAS SAID THAT ITPRODUCES A SORT OF REGENERATING SHUDDER THROUGH THE FRAME AND MAKESONE FEEL READY TO BEGIN A NEW LIFE. A GOOD DEGREE OF THAT EFFECT WASJUST THEN PRESENT IN FRED VINCY.I WILL TRY TO BE WORTHY HE SAID BREAKING OFF BEFORE HE COULD SAYOF YOU AS WELL AS OF HER. AND MEANWHILE MR. FAREBROTHER HAD GATHEREDTHE IMPULSE TO SAY SOMETHING MORE.YOU MUST NOT IMAGINE THAT I BELIEVE THERE IS AT PRESENT ANY DECLINE INHER PREFERENCE OF YOU FRED. SET YOUR HEART AT REST THAT IF YOU KEEPRIGHT OTHER THINGS WILL KEEP RIGHT.I SHALL NEVER FORGET WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FRED ANSWERED. I CANT SAYANYTHING THAT SEEMS WORTH SAYINGONLY I WILL TRY THAT YOUR GOODNESSSHALL NOT BE THROWN AWAY.THATS ENOUGH. GOODBY AND GOD BLESS YOU.IN THAT WAY THEY PARTED. BUT BOTH OF THEM WALKED ABOUT A LONG WHILEBEFORE THEY WENT OUT OF THE STARLIGHT. MUCH OF FREDS RUMINATION MIGHTBE SUMMED UP IN THE WORDS IT CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A FINE THINGFOR HER TO MARRY FAREBROTHERBUT IF SHE LOVES ME BEST AND I AM A GOODHUSBANDPERHAPS MR. FAREBROTHERS MIGHT BE CONCENTRATED INTO A SINGLE SHRUG ANDONE LITTLE SPEECH. TO THINK OF THE PART ONE LITTLE WOMAN CAN PLAY INTHE LIFE OF A MAN SO THAT TO RENOUNCE HER MAY BE A VERY GOOD IMITATIONOF HEROISM AND TO WIN HER MAY BE A DISCIPLINECHAPTER LXVII.NOW IS THERE CIVIL WAR WITHIN THE SOULRESOLVE IS THRUST FROM OFF THE SACRED THRONEBY CLAMOROUS NEEDS AND PRIDE THE GRANDVIZIERMAKES HUMBLE COMPACT PLAYS THE SUPPLE PARTOF ENVOY AND DEFTTONGUED APOLOGISTFOR HUNGRY REBELS.HAPPILY LYDGATE HAD ENDED BY LOSING IN THE BILLIARDROOM AND BROUGHTAWAY NO ENCOURAGEMENT TO MAKE A RAID ON LUCK. ON THE CONTRARY HE FELTUNMIXED DISGUST WITH HIMSELF THE NEXT DAY WHEN HE HAD TO PAY FOUR ORFIVE POUNDS OVER AND ABOVE HIS GAINS AND HE CARRIED ABOUT WITH HIM AMOST UNPLEASANT VISION OF THE FIGURE HE HAD MADE NOT ONLY RUBBINGELBOWS WITH THE MEN AT THE GREEN DRAGON BUT BEHAVING JUST AS THEY DID.A PHILOSOPHER FALLEN TO BETTING IS HARDLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM APHILISTINE UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES THE DIFFERENCE WILL CHIEFLY BEFOUND IN HIS SUBSEQUENT REFLECTIONS AND LYDGATE CHEWED A VERYDISAGREEABLE CUD IN THAT WAY. HIS REASON TOLD HIM HOW THE AFFAIR MIGHTHAVE BEEN MAGNIFIED INTO RUIN BY A SLIGHT CHANGE OF SCENERYIF IT HADBEEN A GAMBLINGHOUSE THAT HE HAD TURNED INTO WHERE CHANCE COULD BECLUTCHED WITH BOTH HANDS INSTEAD OF BEING PICKED UP WITH THUMB ANDFOREFINGER. NEVERTHELESS THOUGH REASON STRANGLED THE DESIRE TOGAMBLE THERE REMAINED THE FEELING THAT WITH AN ASSURANCE OF LUCK TOTHE NEEDFUL AMOUNT HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GAMBLE RATHER THAN TAKE THEALTERNATIVE WHICH WAS BEGINNING TO URGE ITSELF AS INEVITABLE.THAT ALTERNATIVE WAS TO APPLY TO MR. BULSTRODE. LYDGATE HAD SO MANYTIMES BOASTED BOTH TO HIMSELF AND OTHERS THAT HE WAS TOTALLYINDEPENDENT OF BULSTRODE TO WHOSE PLANS HE HAD LENT HIMSELF SOLELYBECAUSE THEY ENABLED HIM TO CARRY OUT HIS OWN IDEAS OF PROFESSIONALWORK AND PUBLIC BENEFITHE HAD SO CONSTANTLY IN THEIR PERSONALINTERCOURSE HAD HIS PRIDE SUSTAINED BY THE SENSE THAT HE WAS MAKING AGOOD SOCIAL USE OF THIS PREDOMINATING BANKER WHOSE OPINIONS HE THOUGHTCONTEMPTIBLE AND WHOSE MOTIVES OFTEN SEEMED TO HIM AN ABSURD MIXTURE OFCONTRADICTORY IMPRESSIONSTHAT HE HAD BEEN CREATING FOR HIMSELF STRONGIDEAL OBSTACLES TO THE PROFFERING OF ANY CONSIDERABLE REQUEST TO HIM ONHIS OWN ACCOUNT.STILL EARLY IN MARCH HIS AFFAIRS WERE AT THAT PASS IN WHICH MEN BEGINTO SAY THAT THEIR OATHS WERE DELIVERED IN IGNORANCE AND TO PERCEIVETHAT THE ACT WHICH THEY HAD CALLED IMPOSSIBLE TO THEM IS BECOMINGMANIFESTLY POSSIBLE. WITH DOVERS UGLY SECURITY SOON TO BE PUT INFORCE WITH THE PROCEEDS OF HIS PRACTICE IMMEDIATELY ABSORBED IN PAYINGBACK DEBTS AND WITH THE CHANCE IF THE WORST WERE KNOWN OF DAILYSUPPLIES BEING REFUSED ON CREDIT ABOVE ALL WITH THE VISION OFROSAMONDS HOPELESS DISCONTENT CONTINUALLY HAUNTING HIM LYDGATE HADBEGUN TO SEE THAT HE SHOULD INEVITABLY BEND HIMSELF TO ASK HELP FROMSOMEBODY OR OTHER. AT FIRST HE HAD CONSIDERED WHETHER HE SHOULD WRITETO MR. VINCY BUT ON QUESTIONING ROSAMOND HE FOUND THAT AS HE HADSUSPECTED SHE HAD ALREADY APPLIED TWICE TO HER FATHER THE LAST TIMEBEING SINCE THE DISAPPOINTMENT FROM SIR GODWIN AND PAPA HAD SAID THATLYDGATE MUST LOOK OUT FOR HIMSELF. PAPA SAID HE HAD COME WITH ONE BADYEAR AFTER ANOTHER TO TRADE MORE AND MORE ON BORROWED CAPITAL AND HADHAD TO GIVE UP MANY INDULGENCES HE COULD NOT SPARE A SINGLE HUNDREDFROM THE CHARGES OF HIS FAMILY. HE SAID LET LYDGATE ASK BULSTRODETHEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HAND AND GLOVE.INDEED LYDGATE HIMSELF HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IF HE MUST ENDBY ASKING FOR A FREE LOAN HIS RELATIONS WITH BULSTRODE MORE AT LEASTTHAN WITH ANY OTHER MAN MIGHT TAKE THE SHAPE OF A CLAIM WHICH WAS NOTPURELY PERSONAL. BULSTRODE HAD INDIRECTLY HELPED TO CAUSE THE FAILUREOF HIS PRACTICE AND HAD ALSO BEEN HIGHLY GRATIFIED BY GETTING AMEDICAL PARTNER IN HIS PLANSBUT WHO AMONG US EVER REDUCED HIMSELF TOTHE SORT OF DEPENDENCE IN WHICH LYDGATE NOW STOOD WITHOUT TRYING TOBELIEVE THAT HE HAD CLAIMS WHICH DIMINISHED THE HUMILIATION OF ASKINGIT WAS TRUE THAT OF LATE THERE HAD SEEMED TO BE A NEW LANGUOR OFINTEREST IN BULSTRODE ABOUT THE HOSPITAL BUT HIS HEALTH HAD GOT WORSEAND SHOWED SIGNS OF A DEEPSEATED NERVOUS AFFECTION. IN OTHER RESPECTSHE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE CHANGED HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HIGHLY POLITE BUTLYDGATE HAD OBSERVED IN HIM FROM THE FIRST A MARKED COLDNESS ABOUT HISMARRIAGE AND OTHER PRIVATE CIRCUMSTANCES A COLDNESS WHICH HE HADHITHERTO PREFERRED TO ANY WARMTH OF FAMILIARITY BETWEEN THEM. HEDEFERRED THE INTENTION FROM DAY TO DAY HIS HABIT OF ACTING ON HISCONCLUSIONS BEING MADE INFIRM BY HIS REPUGNANCE TO EVERY POSSIBLECONCLUSION AND ITS CONSEQUENT ACT. HE SAW MR. BULSTRODE OFTEN BUT HEDID NOT TRY TO USE ANY OCCASION FOR HIS PRIVATE PURPOSE. AT ONE MOMENTHE THOUGHT I WILL WRITE A LETTER I PREFER THAT TO ANY CIRCUITOUSTALK AT ANOTHER HE THOUGHT NO IF I WERE TALKING TO HIM I COULDMAKE A RETREAT BEFORE ANY SIGNS OF DISINCLINATION.STILL THE DAYS PASSED AND NO LETTER WAS WRITTEN NO SPECIAL INTERVIEWSOUGHT. IN HIS SHRINKING FROM THE HUMILIATION OF A DEPENDENT ATTITUDETOWARDS BULSTRODE HE BEGAN TO FAMILIARIZE HIS IMAGINATION WITH ANOTHERSTEP EVEN MORE UNLIKE HIS REMEMBERED SELF. HE BEGAN SPONTANEOUSLY TOCONSIDER WHETHER IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THAT PUERILE NOTIONOF ROSAMONDS WHICH HAD OFTEN MADE HIM ANGRY NAMELY THAT THEY SHOULDQUIT MIDDLEMARCH WITHOUT SEEING ANYTHING BEYOND THAT PREFACE. THEQUESTION CAMEWOULD ANY MAN BUY THE PRACTICE OF ME EVEN NOW FOR ASLITTLE AS IT IS WORTH THEN THE SALE MIGHT HAPPEN AS A NECESSARYPREPARATION FOR GOING AWAY.BUT AGAINST HIS TAKING THIS STEP WHICH HE STILL FELT TO BE ACONTEMPTIBLE RELINQUISHMENT OF PRESENT WORK A GUILTY TURNING ASIDEFROM WHAT WAS A REAL AND MIGHT BE A WIDENING CHANNEL FOR WORTHYACTIVITY TO START AGAIN WITHOUT ANY JUSTIFIED DESTINATION THERE WASTHIS OBSTACLE THAT THE PURCHASER IF PROCURABLE AT ALL MIGHT NOT BEQUICKLY FORTHCOMING. AND AFTERWARDS ROSAMOND IN A POOR LODGING THOUGHIN THE LARGEST CITY OR MOST DISTANT TOWN WOULD NOT FIND THE LIFE THATCOULD SAVE HER FROM GLOOM AND SAVE HIM FROM THE REPROACH OF HAVINGPLUNGED HER INTO IT. FOR WHEN A MAN IS AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL IN HISFORTUNES HE MAY STAY A LONG WHILE THERE IN SPITE OF PROFESSIONALACCOMPLISHMENT. IN THE BRITISH CLIMATE THERE IS NO INCOMPATIBILITYBETWEEN SCIENTIFIC INSIGHT AND FURNISHED LODGINGS THE INCOMPATIBILITYIS CHIEFLY BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC AMBITION AND A WIFE WHO OBJECTS TO THATKIND OF RESIDENCE.BUT IN THE MIDST OF HIS HESITATION OPPORTUNITY CAME TO DECIDE HIM. ANOTE FROM MR. BULSTRODE REQUESTED LYDGATE TO CALL ON HIM AT THE BANK. AHYPOCHONDRIACAL TENDENCY HAD SHOWN ITSELF IN THE BANKERS CONSTITUTIONOF LATE AND A LACK OF SLEEP WHICH WAS REALLY ONLY A SLIGHTEXAGGERATION OF AN HABITUAL DYSPEPTIC SYMPTOM HAD BEEN DWELT ON BY HIMAS A SIGN OF THREATENING INSANITY. HE WANTED TO CONSULT LYDGATE WITHOUTDELAY ON THAT PARTICULAR MORNING ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOTHING TO TELLBEYOND WHAT HE HAD TOLD BEFORE. HE LISTENED EAGERLY TO WHAT LYDGATE HADTO SAY IN DISSIPATION OF HIS FEARS THOUGH THIS TOO WAS ONLYREPETITION AND THIS MOMENT IN WHICH BULSTRODE WAS RECEIVING A MEDICALOPINION WITH A SENSE OF COMFORT SEEMED TO MAKE THE COMMUNICATION OF APERSONAL NEED TO HIM EASIER THAN IT HAD BEEN IN LYDGATES CONTEMPLATIONBEFOREHAND. HE HAD BEEN INSISTING THAT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR MR.BULSTRODE TO RELAX HIS ATTENTION TO BUSINESS.ONE SEES HOW ANY MENTAL STRAIN HOWEVER SLIGHT MAY AFFECT A DELICATEFRAME SAID LYDGATE AT THAT STAGE OF THE CONSULTATION WHEN THE REMARKSTEND TO PASS FROM THE PERSONAL TO THE GENERAL BY THE DEEP STAMP WHICHANXIETY WILL MAKE FOR A TIME EVEN ON THE YOUNG AND VIGOROUS. I AMNATURALLY VERY STRONG YET I HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY SHAKEN LATELY BY ANACCUMULATION OF TROUBLE.I PRESUME THAT A CONSTITUTION IN THE SUSCEPTIBLE STATE IN WHICH MINEAT PRESENT IS WOULD BE ESPECIALLY LIABLE TO FALL A VICTIM TO CHOLERAIF IT VISITED OUR DISTRICT. AND SINCE ITS APPEARANCE NEAR LONDON WEMAY WELL BESIEGE THE MERCYSEAT FOR OUR PROTECTION SAID MR.BULSTRODE NOT INTENDING TO EVADE LYDGATES ALLUSION BUT REALLYPREOCCUPIED WITH ALARMS ABOUT HIMSELF.YOU HAVE AT ALL EVENTS TAKEN YOUR SHARE IN USING GOOD PRACTICALPRECAUTIONS FOR THE TOWN AND THAT IS THE BEST MODE OF ASKING FORPROTECTION SAID LYDGATE WITH A STRONG DISTASTE FOR THE BROKENMETAPHOR AND BAD LOGIC OF THE BANKERS RELIGION SOMEWHAT INCREASED BYTHE APPARENT DEAFNESS OF HIS SYMPATHY. BUT HIS MIND HAD TAKEN UP ITSLONGPREPARED MOVEMENT TOWARDS GETTING HELP AND WAS NOT YET ARRESTED.HE ADDED THE TOWN HAS DONE WELL IN THE WAY OF CLEANSING AND FINDINGAPPLIANCES AND I THINK THAT IF THE CHOLERA SHOULD COME EVEN OURENEMIES WILL ADMIT THAT THE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE HOSPITAL ARE A PUBLICGOOD.TRULY SAID MR. BULSTRODE WITH SOME COLDNESS. WITH REGARD TO WHATYOU SAY MR. LYDGATE ABOUT THE RELAXATION OF MY MENTAL LABOR I HAVEFOR SOME TIME BEEN ENTERTAINING A PURPOSE TO THAT EFFECTA PURPOSE OF AVERY DECIDED CHARACTER. I CONTEMPLATE AT LEAST A TEMPORARY WITHDRAWALFROM THE MANAGEMENT OF MUCH BUSINESS WHETHER BENEVOLENT OR COMMERCIAL.ALSO I THINK OF CHANGING MY RESIDENCE FOR A TIME PROBABLY I SHALLCLOSE OR LET THE SHRUBS AND TAKE SOME PLACE NEAR THE COASTUNDERADVICE OF COURSE AS TO SALUBRITY. THAT WOULD BE A MEASURE WHICH YOUWOULD RECOMMENDOH YES SAID LYDGATE FALLING BACKWARD IN HIS CHAIR WITHILLREPRESSED IMPATIENCE UNDER THE BANKERS PALE EARNEST EYES ANDINTENSE PREOCCUPATION WITH HIMSELF.I HAVE FOR SOME TIME FELT THAT I SHOULD OPEN THIS SUBJECT WITH YOU INRELATION TO OUR HOSPITAL CONTINUED BULSTRODE. UNDER THECIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE INDICATED OF COURSE I MUST CEASE TO HAVE ANYPERSONAL SHARE IN THE MANAGEMENT AND IT IS CONTRARY TO MY VIEWS OFRESPONSIBILITY TO CONTINUE A LARGE APPLICATION OF MEANS TO ANINSTITUTION WHICH I CANNOT WATCH OVER AND TO SOME EXTENT REGULATE. ISHALL THEREFORE IN CASE OF MY ULTIMATE DECISION TO LEAVE MIDDLEMARCHCONSIDER THAT I WITHDRAW OTHER SUPPORT TO THE NEW HOSPITAL THAN THATWHICH WILL SUBSIST IN THE FACT THAT I CHIEFLY SUPPLIED THE EXPENSES OFBUILDING IT AND HAVE CONTRIBUTED FURTHER LARGE SUMS TO ITS SUCCESSFULWORKING.LYDGATES THOUGHT WHEN BULSTRODE PAUSED ACCORDING TO HIS WONT WASHE HAS PERHAPS BEEN LOSING A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY. THIS WAS THE MOSTPLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION OF A SPEECH WHICH HAD CAUSED RATHER A STARTLINGCHANGE IN HIS EXPECTATIONS. HE SAID IN REPLYTHE LOSS TO THE HOSPITAL CAN HARDLY BE MADE UP I FEAR.HARDLY RETURNED BULSTRODE IN THE SAME DELIBERATE SILVERY TONEEXCEPT BY SOME CHANGES OF PLAN. THE ONLY PERSON WHO MAY BE CERTAINLYCOUNTED ON AS WILLING TO INCREASE HER CONTRIBUTIONS IS MRS. CASAUBON. IHAVE HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH HER ON THE SUBJECT AND I HAVE POINTED OUTTO HER AS I AM ABOUT TO DO TO YOU THAT IT WILL BE DESIRABLE TO WIN AMORE GENERAL SUPPORT TO THE NEW HOSPITAL BY A CHANGE OF SYSTEM.ANOTHER PAUSE BUT LYDGATE DID NOT SPEAK.THE CHANGE I MEAN IS AN AMALGAMATION WITH THE INFIRMARY SO THAT THENEW HOSPITAL SHALL BE REGARDED AS A SPECIAL ADDITION TO THE ELDERINSTITUTION HAVING THE SAME DIRECTING BOARD. IT WILL BE NECESSARYALSO THAT THE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF THE TWO SHALL BE COMBINED. IN THISWAY ANY DIFFICULTY AS TO THE ADEQUATE MAINTENANCE OF OUR NEWESTABLISHMENT WILL BE REMOVED THE BENEVOLENT INTERESTS OF THE TOWNWILL CEASE TO BE DIVIDED.MR. BULSTRODE HAD LOWERED HIS EYES FROM LYDGATES FACE TO THE BUTTONSOF HIS COAT AS HE AGAIN PAUSED.NO DOUBT THAT IS A GOOD DEVICE AS TO WAYS AND MEANS SAID LYDGATEWITH AN EDGE OF IRONY IN HIS TONE. BUT I CANT BE EXPECTED TO REJOICEIN IT AT ONCE SINCE ONE OF THE FIRST RESULTS WILL BE THAT THE OTHERMEDICAL MEN WILL UPSET OR INTERRUPT MY METHODS IF IT WERE ONLY BECAUSETHEY ARE MINE.I MYSELF AS YOU KNOW MR. LYDGATE HIGHLY VALUED THE OPPORTUNITY OFNEW AND INDEPENDENT PROCEDURE WHICH YOU HAVE DILIGENTLY EMPLOYED THEORIGINAL PLAN I CONFESS WAS ONE WHICH I HAD MUCH AT HEART UNDERSUBMISSION TO THE DIVINE WILL. BUT SINCE PROVIDENTIAL INDICATIONSDEMAND A RENUNCIATION FROM ME I RENOUNCE.BULSTRODE SHOWED A RATHER EXASPERATING ABILITY IN THIS CONVERSATION.THE BROKEN METAPHOR AND BAD LOGIC OF MOTIVE WHICH HAD STIRRED HISHEARERS CONTEMPT WERE QUITE CONSISTENT WITH A MODE OF PUTTING THEFACTS WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR LYDGATE TO VENT HIS OWN INDIGNATIONAND DISAPPOINTMENT. AFTER SOME RAPID REFLECTION HE ONLY ASKEDWHAT DID MRS. CASAUBON SAYTHAT WAS THE FURTHER STATEMENT WHICH I WISHED TO MAKE TO YOU SAIDBULSTRODE WHO HAD THOROUGHLY PREPARED HIS MINISTERIAL EXPLANATION.SHE IS YOU ARE AWARE A WOMAN OF MOST MUNIFICENT DISPOSITION ANDHAPPILY IN POSSESSIONNOT I PRESUME OF GREAT WEALTH BUT OF FUNDS WHICHSHE CAN WELL SPARE. SHE HAS INFORMED ME THAT THOUGH SHE HAS DESTINEDTHE CHIEF PART OF THOSE FUNDS TO ANOTHER PURPOSE SHE IS WILLING TOCONSIDER WHETHER SHE CANNOT FULLY TAKE MY PLACE IN RELATION TO THEHOSPITAL. BUT SHE WISHES FOR AMPLE TIME TO MATURE HER THOUGHTS ON THESUBJECT AND I HAVE TOLD HER THAT THERE IS NO NEED FOR HASTETHAT INFACT MY OWN PLANS ARE NOT YET ABSOLUTE.LYDGATE WAS READY TO SAY IF MRS. CASAUBON WOULD TAKE YOUR PLACETHERE WOULD BE GAIN INSTEAD OF LOSS. BUT THERE WAS STILL A WEIGHT ONHIS MIND WHICH ARRESTED THIS CHEERFUL CANDOR. HE REPLIED I SUPPOSETHEN THAT I MAY ENTER INTO THE SUBJECT WITH MRS. CASAUBON.PRECISELY THAT IS WHAT SHE EXPRESSLY DESIRES. HER DECISION SHE SAYSWILL MUCH DEPEND ON WHAT YOU CAN TELL HER. BUT NOT AT PRESENT SHE ISI BELIEVE JUST SETTING OUT ON A JOURNEY. I HAVE HER LETTER HERE SAIDMR. BULSTRODE DRAWING IT OUT AND READING FROM IT. I AM IMMEDIATELYOTHERWISE ENGAGED SHE SAYS. I AM GOING INTO YORKSHIRE WITH SIR JAMESAND LADY CHETTAM AND THE CONCLUSIONS I COME TO ABOUT SOME LAND WHICH IAM TO SEE THERE MAY AFFECT MY POWER OF CONTRIBUTING TO THE HOSPITAL.THUS MR. LYDGATE THERE IS NO HASTE NECESSARY IN THIS MATTER BUT IWISHED TO APPRISE YOU BEFOREHAND OF WHAT MAY POSSIBLY OCCUR.MR. BULSTRODE RETURNED THE LETTER TO HIS SIDEPOCKET AND CHANGED HISATTITUDE AS IF HIS BUSINESS WERE CLOSED. LYDGATE WHOSE RENEWED HOPEABOUT THE HOSPITAL ONLY MADE HIM MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE FACTS WHICHPOISONED HIS HOPE FELT THAT HIS EFFORT AFTER HELP IF MADE AT ALLMUST BE MADE NOW AND VIGOROUSLY.I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR GIVING ME FULL NOTICE HE SAID WITH AFIRM INTENTION IN HIS TONE YET WITH AN INTERRUPTEDNESS IN HIS DELIVERYWHICH SHOWED THAT HE SPOKE UNWILLINGLY. THE HIGHEST OBJECT TO ME IS MYPROFESSION AND I HAD IDENTIFIED THE HOSPITAL WITH THE BEST USE I CANAT PRESENT MAKE OF MY PROFESSION. BUT THE BEST USE IS NOT ALWAYS THESAME WITH MONETARY SUCCESS. EVERYTHING WHICH HAS MADE THE HOSPITALUNPOPULAR HAS HELPED WITH OTHER CAUSESI THINK THEY ARE ALL CONNECTEDWITH MY PROFESSIONAL ZEALTO MAKE ME UNPOPULAR AS A PRACTITIONER. I GETCHIEFLY PATIENTS WHO CANT PAY ME. I SHOULD LIKE THEM BEST IF I HADNOBODY TO PAY ON MY OWN SIDE. LYDGATE WAITED A LITTLE BUT BULSTRODEONLY BOWED LOOKING AT HIM FIXEDLY AND HE WENT ON WITH THE SAMEINTERRUPTED ENUNCIATIONAS IF HE WERE BITING AN OBJECTIONAL LEEK.I HAVE SLIPPED INTO MONEY DIFFICULTIES WHICH I CAN SEE NO WAY OUT OFUNLESS SOME ONE WHO TRUSTS ME AND MY FUTURE WILL ADVANCE ME A SUMWITHOUT OTHER SECURITY. I HAD VERY LITTLE FORTUNE LEFT WHEN I CAMEHERE. I HAVE NO PROSPECTS OF MONEY FROM MY OWN FAMILY. MY EXPENSES INCONSEQUENCE OF MY MARRIAGE HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH GREATER THAN I HADEXPECTED. THE RESULT AT THIS MOMENT IS THAT IT WOULD TAKE A THOUSANDPOUNDS TO CLEAR ME. I MEAN TO FREE ME FROM THE RISK OF HAVING ALL MYGOODS SOLD IN SECURITY OF MY LARGEST DEBTAS WELL AS TO PAY MY OTHERDEBTSAND LEAVE ANYTHING TO KEEP US A LITTLE BEFOREHAND WITH OUR SMALLINCOME. I FIND THAT IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT MY WIFES FATHERSHOULD MAKE SUCH AN ADVANCE. THAT IS WHY I MENTION MY POSITION TOTOTHE ONLY OTHER MAN WHO MAY BE HELD TO HAVE SOME PERSONAL CONNECTIONWITH MY PROSPERITY OR RUIN.LYDGATE HATED TO HEAR HIMSELF. BUT HE HAD SPOKEN NOW AND HAD SPOKENWITH UNMISTAKABLE DIRECTNESS. MR. BULSTRODE REPLIED WITHOUT HASTE BUTALSO WITHOUT HESITATION.I AM GRIEVED THOUGH I CONFESS NOT SURPRISED BY THIS INFORMATIONMR. LYDGATE. FOR MY OWN PART I REGRETTED YOUR ALLIANCE WITH MYBROTHERINLAWS FAMILY WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN OF PRODIGAL HABITS ANDWHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN MUCH INDEBTED TO ME FOR SUSTAINMENT IN ITSPRESENT POSITION. MY ADVICE TO YOU MR. LYDGATE WOULD BE THAT INSTEADOF INVOLVING YOURSELF IN FURTHER OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINUING A DOUBTFULSTRUGGLE YOU SHOULD SIMPLY BECOME A BANKRUPT.THAT WOULD NOT IMPROVE MY PROSPECT SAID LYDGATE RISING AND SPEAKINGBITTERLY EVEN IF IT WERE A MORE AGREEABLE THING IN ITSELF.IT IS ALWAYS A TRIAL SAID MR. BULSTRODE BUT TRIAL MY DEAR SIR ISOUR PORTION HERE AND IS A NEEDED CORRECTIVE. I RECOMMEND YOU TO WEIGHTHE ADVICE I HAVE GIVEN.THANK YOU SAID LYDGATE NOT QUITE KNOWING WHAT HE SAID. I HAVEOCCUPIED YOU TOO LONG. GOODDAY.CHAPTER LXVIII.WHAT SUIT OF GRACE HATH VIRTUE TO PUT ONIF VICE SHALL WEAR AS GOOD AND DO AS WELLIF WRONG IF CRAFT IF INDISCRETIONACT AS FAIR PARTS WITH ENDS AS LAUDABLEWHICH ALL THIS MIGHTY VOLUME OF EVENTSTHE WORLD THE UNIVERSAL MAP OF DEEDSSTRONGLY CONTROLS AND PROVES FROM ALL DESCENTSTHAT THE DIRECTEST COURSE STILL BEST SUCCEEDS.FOR SHOULD NOT GRAVE AND LEARND EXPERIENCETHAT LOOKS WITH THE EYES OF ALL THE WORLD BESIDEAND WITH ALL AGES HOLDS INTELLIGENCEGO SAFER THAN DECEIT WITHOUT A GUIDEDANIEL MUSOPHILUS.THAT CHANGE OF PLAN AND SHIFTING OF INTEREST WHICH BULSTRODE STATED ORBETRAYED IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH LYDGATE HAD BEEN DETERMINED IN HIMBY SOME SEVERE EXPERIENCE WHICH HE HAD GONE THROUGH SINCE THE EPOCH OFMR. LARCHERS SALE WHEN RAFFLES HAD RECOGNIZED WILL LADISLAW AND WHENTHE BANKER HAD IN VAIN ATTEMPTED AN ACT OF RESTITUTION WHICH MIGHT MOVEDIVINE PROVIDENCE TO ARREST PAINFUL CONSEQUENCES.HIS CERTAINTY THAT RAFFLES UNLESS HE WERE DEAD WOULD RETURN TOMIDDLEMARCH BEFORE LONG HAD BEEN JUSTIFIED. ON CHRISTMAS EVE HE HADREAPPEARED AT THE SHRUBS. BULSTRODE WAS AT HOME TO RECEIVE HIM ANDHINDER HIS COMMUNICATION WITH THE REST OF THE FAMILY BUT HE COULD NOTALTOGETHER HINDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE VISIT FROM COMPROMISINGHIMSELF AND ALARMING HIS WIFE. RAFFLES PROVED MORE UNMANAGEABLE THAN HEHAD SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE IN HIS FORMER APPEARANCES HIS CHRONIC STATE OFMENTAL RESTLESSNESS THE GROWING EFFECT OF HABITUAL INTEMPERANCEQUICKLY SHAKING OFF EVERY IMPRESSION FROM WHAT WAS SAID TO HIM. HEINSISTED ON STAYING IN THE HOUSE AND BULSTRODE WEIGHING TWO SETS OFEVILS FELT THAT THIS WAS AT LEAST NOT A WORSE ALTERNATIVE THAN HISGOING INTO THE TOWN. HE KEPT HIM IN HIS OWN ROOM FOR THE EVENING ANDSAW HIM TO BED RAFFLES ALL THE WHILE AMUSING HIMSELF WITH THEANNOYANCE HE WAS CAUSING THIS DECENT AND HIGHLY PROSPEROUSFELLOWSINNER AN AMUSEMENT WHICH HE FACETIOUSLY EXPRESSED AS SYMPATHYWITH HIS FRIENDS PLEASURE IN ENTERTAINING A MAN WHO HAD BEENSERVICEABLE TO HIM AND WHO HAD NOT HAD ALL HIS EARNINGS. THERE WAS ACUNNING CALCULATION UNDER THIS NOISY JOKINGA COOL RESOLVE TO EXTRACTSOMETHING THE HANDSOMER FROM BULSTRODE AS PAYMENT FOR RELEASE FROM THISNEW APPLICATION OF TORTURE. BUT HIS CUNNING HAD A LITTLE OVERCAST ITSMARK.BULSTRODE WAS INDEED MORE TORTURED THAN THE COARSE FIBRE OF RAFFLESCOULD ENABLE HIM TO IMAGINE. HE HAD TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE WAS SIMPLYTAKING CARE OF THIS WRETCHED CREATURE THE VICTIM OF VICE WHO MIGHTOTHERWISE INJURE HIMSELF HE IMPLIED WITHOUT THE DIRECT FORM OFFALSEHOOD THAT THERE WAS A FAMILY TIE WHICH BOUND HIM TO THIS CAREAND THAT THERE WERE SIGNS OF MENTAL ALIENATION IN RAFFLES WHICH URGEDCAUTION. HE WOULD HIMSELF DRIVE THE UNFORTUNATE BEING AWAY THE NEXTMORNING. IN THESE HINTS HE FELT THAT HE WAS SUPPLYING MRS. BULSTRODEWITH PRECAUTIONARY INFORMATION FOR HIS DAUGHTERS AND SERVANTS ANDACCOUNTING FOR HIS ALLOWING NO ONE BUT HIMSELF TO ENTER THE ROOM EVENWITH FOOD AND DRINK. BUT HE SAT IN AN AGONY OF FEAR LEST RAFFLES SHOULDBE OVERHEARD IN HIS LOUD AND PLAIN REFERENCES TO PAST FACTSLEST MRS.BULSTRODE SHOULD BE EVEN TEMPTED TO LISTEN AT THE DOOR. HOW COULD HEHINDER HER HOW BETRAY HIS TERROR BY OPENING THE DOOR TO DETECT HERSHE WAS A WOMAN OF HONEST DIRECT HABITS AND LITTLE LIKELY TO TAKE SOLOW A COURSE IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT PAINFUL KNOWLEDGE BUT FEAR WASSTRONGER THAN THE CALCULATION OF PROBABILITIES.IN THIS WAY RAFFLES HAD PUSHED THE TORTURE TOO FAR AND PRODUCED ANEFFECT WHICH HAD NOT BEEN IN HIS PLAN. BY SHOWING HIMSELF HOPELESSLYUNMANAGEABLE HE HAD MADE BULSTRODE FEEL THAT A STRONG DEFIANCE WAS THEONLY RESOURCE LEFT. AFTER TAKING RAFFLES TO BED THAT NIGHT THE BANKERORDERED HIS CLOSED CARRIAGE TO BE READY AT HALFPAST SEVEN THE NEXTMORNING. AT SIX OCLOCK HE HAD ALREADY BEEN LONG DRESSED AND HAD SPENTSOME OF HIS WRETCHEDNESS IN PRAYER PLEADING HIS MOTIVES FOR AVERTINGTHE WORST EVIL IF IN ANYTHING HE HAD USED FALSITY AND SPOKEN WHAT WASNOT TRUE BEFORE GOD. FOR BULSTRODE SHRANK FROM A DIRECT LIE WITH ANINTENSITY DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE NUMBER OF HIS MORE INDIRECT MISDEEDS.BUT MANY OF THESE MISDEEDS WERE LIKE THE SUBTLE MUSCULAR MOVEMENTSWHICH ARE NOT TAKEN ACCOUNT OF IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS THOUGH THEY BRINGABOUT THE END THAT WE FIX OUR MIND ON AND DESIRE. AND IT IS ONLY WHATWE ARE VIVIDLY CONSCIOUS OF THAT WE CAN VIVIDLY IMAGINE TO BE SEEN BYOMNISCIENCE.BULSTRODE CARRIED HIS CANDLE TO THE BEDSIDE OF RAFFLES WHO WASAPPARENTLY IN A PAINFUL DREAM. HE STOOD SILENT HOPING THAT THEPRESENCE OF THE LIGHT WOULD SERVE TO WAKEN THE SLEEPER GRADUALLY ANDGENTLY FOR HE FEARED SOME NOISE AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF A TOO SUDDENAWAKENING. HE HAD WATCHED FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES OR MORE THESHUDDERINGS AND PANTINGS WHICH SEEMED LIKELY TO END IN WAKING WHENRAFFLES WITH A LONG HALFSTIFLED MOAN STARTED UP AND STARED ROUND HIMIN TERROR TREMBLING AND GASPING. BUT HE MADE NO FURTHER NOISE ANDBULSTRODE SETTING DOWN THE CANDLE AWAITED HIS RECOVERY.IT WAS A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER BEFORE BULSTRODE WITH A COLDPEREMPTORINESS OF MANNER WHICH HE HAD NOT BEFORE SHOWN SAID I CAMETO CALL YOU THUS EARLY MR. RAFFLES BECAUSE I HAVE ORDERED THECARRIAGE TO BE READY AT HALFPAST SEVEN AND INTEND MYSELF TO CONDUCTYOU AS FAR AS ILSELY WHERE YOU CAN EITHER TAKE THE RAILWAY OR AWAIT ACOACH. RAFFLES WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK BUT BULSTRODE ANTICIPATED HIMIMPERIOUSLY WITH THE WORDS BE SILENT SIR AND HEAR WHAT I HAVE TOSAY. I SHALL SUPPLY YOU WITH MONEY NOW AND I WILL FURNISH YOU WITH AREASONABLE SUM FROM TIME TO TIME ON YOUR APPLICATION TO ME BY LETTERBUT IF YOU CHOOSE TO PRESENT YOURSELF HERE AGAIN IF YOU RETURN TOMIDDLEMARCH IF YOU USE YOUR TONGUE IN A MANNER INJURIOUS TO ME YOUWILL HAVE TO LIVE ON SUCH FRUITS AS YOUR MALICE CAN BRING YOU WITHOUTHELP FROM ME. NOBODY WILL PAY YOU WELL FOR BLASTING MY NAME I KNOW THEWORST YOU CAN DO AGAINST ME AND I SHALL BRAVE IT IF YOU DARE TO THRUSTYOURSELF UPON ME AGAIN. GET UP SIR AND DO AS I ORDER YOU WITHOUTNOISE OR I WILL SEND FOR A POLICEMAN TO TAKE YOU OFF MY PREMISES ANDYOU MAY CARRY YOUR STORIES INTO EVERY POTHOUSE IN THE TOWN BUT YOUSHALL HAVE NO SIXPENCE FROM ME TO PAY YOUR EXPENSES THERE.BULSTRODE HAD RARELY IN HIS LIFE SPOKEN WITH SUCH NERVOUS ENERGY HEHAD BEEN DELIBERATING ON THIS SPEECH AND ITS PROBABLE EFFECTS THROUGH ALARGE PART OF THE NIGHT AND THOUGH HE DID NOT TRUST TO ITS ULTIMATELYSAVING HIM FROM ANY RETURN OF RAFFLES HE HAD CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS THEBEST THROW HE COULD MAKE. IT SUCCEEDED IN ENFORCING SUBMISSION FROM THEJADED MAN THIS MORNING HIS EMPOISONED SYSTEM AT THIS MOMENT QUAILEDBEFORE BULSTRODES COLD RESOLUTE BEARING AND HE WAS TAKEN OFF QUIETLYIN THE CARRIAGE BEFORE THE FAMILY BREAKFAST TIME. THE SERVANTS IMAGINEDHIM TO BE A POOR RELATION AND WERE NOT SURPRISED THAT A STRICT MANLIKE THEIR MASTER WHO HELD HIS HEAD HIGH IN THE WORLD SHOULD BEASHAMED OF SUCH A COUSIN AND WANT TO GET RID OF HIM. THE BANKERS DRIVEOF TEN MILES WITH HIS HATED COMPANION WAS A DREARY BEGINNING OF THECHRISTMAS DAY BUT AT THE END OF THE DRIVE RAFFLES HAD RECOVERED HISSPIRITS AND PARTED IN A CONTENTMENT FOR WHICH THERE WAS THE GOODREASON THAT THE BANKER HAD GIVEN HIM A HUNDRED POUNDS. VARIOUS MOTIVESURGED BULSTRODE TO THIS OPENHANDEDNESS BUT HE DID NOT HIMSELF INQUIRECLOSELY INTO ALL OF THEM. AS HE HAD STOOD WATCHING RAFFLES IN HISUNEASY SLEEP IT HAD CERTAINLY ENTERED HIS MIND THAT THE MAN HAD BEENMUCH SHATTERED SINCE THE FIRST GIFT OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS.HE HAD TAKEN CARE TO REPEAT THE INCISIVE STATEMENT OF HIS RESOLVE NOTTO BE PLAYED ON ANY MORE AND HAD TRIED TO PENETRATE RAFFLES WITH THEFACT THAT HE HAD SHOWN THE RISKS OF BRIBING HIM TO BE QUITE EQUAL TOTHE RISKS OF DEFYING HIM. BUT WHEN FREED FROM HIS REPULSIVE PRESENCEBULSTRODE RETURNED TO HIS QUIET HOME HE BROUGHT WITH HIM NO CONFIDENCETHAT HE HAD SECURED MORE THAN A RESPITE. IT WAS AS IF HE HAD HAD ALOATHSOME DREAM AND COULD NOT SHAKE OFF ITS IMAGES WITH THEIR HATEFULKINDRED OF SENSATIONSAS IF ON ALL THE PLEASANT SURROUNDINGS OF HISLIFE A DANGEROUS REPTILE HAD LEFT HIS SLIMY TRACES.WHO CAN KNOW HOW MUCH OF HIS MOST INWARD LIFE IS MADE UP OF THETHOUGHTS HE BELIEVES OTHER MEN TO HAVE ABOUT HIM UNTIL THAT FABRIC OFOPINION IS THREATENED WITH RUINBULSTRODE WAS ONLY THE MORE CONSCIOUS THAT THERE WAS A DEPOSIT OFUNEASY PRESENTIMENT IN HIS WIFES MIND BECAUSE SHE CAREFULLY AVOIDEDANY ALLUSION TO IT. HE HAD BEEN USED EVERY DAY TO TASTE THE FLAVOR OFSUPREMACY AND THE TRIBUTE OF COMPLETE DEFERENCE AND THE CERTAINTY THATHE WAS WATCHED OR MEASURED WITH A HIDDEN SUSPICION OF HIS HAVING SOMEDISCREDITABLE SECRET MADE HIS VOICE TOTTER WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING TOEDIFICATION. FORESEEING TO MEN OF BULSTRODES ANXIOUS TEMPERAMENT ISOFTEN WORSE THAN SEEING AND HIS IMAGINATION CONTINUALLY HEIGHTENED THEANGUISH OF AN IMMINENT DISGRACE. YES IMMINENT FOR IF HIS DEFIANCE OFRAFFLES DID NOT KEEP THE MAN AWAYAND THOUGH HE PRAYED FOR THIS RESULTHE HARDLY HOPED FOR ITTHE DISGRACE WAS CERTAIN. IN VAIN HE SAID TOHIMSELF THAT IF PERMITTED IT WOULD BE A DIVINE VISITATION ACHASTISEMENT A PREPARATION HE RECOILED FROM THE IMAGINED BURNING ANDHE JUDGED THAT IT MUST BE MORE FOR THE DIVINE GLORY THAT HE SHOULDESCAPE DISHONOR. THAT RECOIL HAD AT LAST URGED HIM TO MAKE PREPARATIONSFOR QUITTING MIDDLEMARCH. IF EVIL TRUTH MUST BE REPORTED OF HIM HEWOULD THEN BE AT A LESS SCORCHING DISTANCE FROM THE CONTEMPT OF HIS OLDNEIGHBORS AND IN A NEW SCENE WHERE HIS LIFE WOULD NOT HAVE GATHEREDTHE SAME WIDE SENSIBILITY THE TORMENTOR IF HE PURSUED HIM WOULD BELESS FORMIDABLE. TO LEAVE THE PLACE FINALLY WOULD HE KNEW BEEXTREMELY PAINFUL TO HIS WIFE AND ON OTHER GROUNDS HE WOULD HAVEPREFERRED TO STAY WHERE HE HAD STRUCK ROOT. HENCE HE MADE HISPREPARATIONS AT FIRST IN A CONDITIONAL WAY WISHING TO LEAVE ON ALLSIDES AN OPENING FOR HIS RETURN AFTER BRIEF ABSENCE IF ANY FAVORABLEINTERVENTION OF PROVIDENCE SHOULD DISSIPATE HIS FEARS. HE WAS PREPARINGTO TRANSFER HIS MANAGEMENT OF THE BANK AND TO GIVE UP ANY ACTIVECONTROL OF OTHER COMMERCIAL AFFAIRS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE GROUNDOF HIS FAILING HEALTH BUT WITHOUT EXCLUDING HIS FUTURE RESUMPTION OFSUCH WORK. THE MEASURE WOULD CAUSE HIM SOME ADDED EXPENSE AND SOMEDIMINUTION OF INCOME BEYOND WHAT HE HAD ALREADY UNDERGONE FROM THEGENERAL DEPRESSION OF TRADE AND THE HOSPITAL PRESENTED ITSELF AS APRINCIPAL OBJECT OF OUTLAY ON WHICH HE COULD FAIRLY ECONOMIZE.THIS WAS THE EXPERIENCE WHICH HAD DETERMINED HIS CONVERSATION WITHLYDGATE. BUT AT THIS TIME HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD MOST OF THEM GONE NOFARTHER THAN A STAGE AT WHICH HE COULD RECALL THEM IF THEY PROVED TO BEUNNECESSARY. HE CONTINUALLY DEFERRED THE FINAL STEPS IN THE MIDST OFHIS FEARS LIKE MANY A MAN WHO IS IN DANGER OF SHIPWRECK OR OF BEINGDASHED FROM HIS CARRIAGE BY RUNAWAY HORSES HE HAD A CLINGINGIMPRESSION THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO HINDER THE WORST AND THAT TOSPOIL HIS LIFE BY A LATE TRANSPLANTATION MIGHT BE OVERHASTYESPECIALLYSINCE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT SATISFACTORILY TO HIS WIFE FOR THEPROJECT OF THEIR INDEFINITE EXILE FROM THE ONLY PLACE WHERE SHE WOULDLIKE TO LIVE.AMONG THE AFFAIRS BULSTRODE HAD TO CARE FOR WAS THE MANAGEMENT OF THEFARM AT STONE COURT IN CASE OF HIS ABSENCE AND ON THIS AS WELL AS ONALL OTHER MATTERS CONNECTED WITH ANY HOUSES AND LAND HE POSSESSED IN ORABOUT MIDDLEMARCH HE HAD CONSULTED CALEB GARTH. LIKE EVERY ONE ELSEWHO HAD BUSINESS OF THAT SORT HE WANTED TO GET THE AGENT WHO WAS MOREANXIOUS FOR HIS EMPLOYERS INTERESTS THAN HIS OWN. WITH REGARD TO STONECOURT SINCE BULSTRODE WISHED TO RETAIN HIS HOLD ON THE STOCK AND TOHAVE AN ARRANGEMENT BY WHICH HE HIMSELF COULD IF HE CHOSE RESUME HISFAVORITE RECREATION OF SUPERINTENDENCE CALEB HAD ADVISED HIM NOT TOTRUST TO A MERE BAILIFF BUT TO LET THE LAND STOCK AND IMPLEMENTSYEARLY AND TAKE A PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE PROCEEDS.MAY I TRUST TO YOU TO FIND ME A TENANT ON THESE TERMS MR. GARTHSAID BULSTRODE. AND WILL YOU MENTION TO ME THE YEARLY SUM WHICH WOULDREPAY YOU FOR MANAGING THESE AFFAIRS WHICH WE HAVE DISCUSSED TOGETHERILL THINK ABOUT IT SAID CALEB IN HIS BLUNT WAY. ILL SEE HOW ICAN MAKE IT OUT.IF IT HAD NOT BEEN THAT HE HAD TO CONSIDER FRED VINCYS FUTURE MR.GARTH WOULD NOT PROBABLY HAVE BEEN GLAD OF ANY ADDITION TO HIS WORK OFWHICH HIS WIFE WAS ALWAYS FEARING AN EXCESS FOR HIM AS HE GREW OLDER.BUT ON QUITTING BULSTRODE AFTER THAT CONVERSATION A VERY ALLURING IDEAOCCURRED TO HIM ABOUT THIS SAID LETTING OF STONE COURT. WHAT IFBULSTRODE WOULD AGREE TO HIS PLACING FRED VINCY THERE ON THEUNDERSTANDING THAT HE CALEB GARTH SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEMANAGEMENT IT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT SCHOOLING FOR FRED HE MIGHT MAKEA MODEST INCOME THERE AND STILL HAVE TIME LEFT TO GET KNOWLEDGE BYHELPING IN OTHER BUSINESS. HE MENTIONED HIS NOTION TO MRS. GARTH WITHSUCH EVIDENT DELIGHT THAT SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO CHILL HIS PLEASURE BYEXPRESSING HER CONSTANT FEAR OF HIS UNDERTAKING TOO MUCH.THE LAD WOULD BE AS HAPPY AS TWO HE SAID THROWING HIMSELF BACK INHIS CHAIR AND LOOKING RADIANT IF I COULD TELL HIM IT WAS ALLSETTLED. THINK SUSAN HIS MIND HAD BEEN RUNNING ON THAT PLACE FORYEARS BEFORE OLD FEATHERSTONE DIED. AND IT WOULD BE AS PRETTY A TURN OFTHINGS AS COULD BE THAT HE SHOULD HOLD THE PLACE IN A GOOD INDUSTRIOUSWAY AFTER ALLBY HIS TAKING TO BUSINESS. FOR ITS LIKELY ENOUGHBULSTRODE MIGHT LET HIM GO ON AND GRADUALLY BUY THE STOCK. HE HASNTMADE UP HIS MIND I CAN SEE WHETHER OR NOT HE SHALL SETTLE SOMEWHEREELSE AS A LASTING THING. I NEVER WAS BETTER PLEASED WITH A NOTION IN MYLIFE. AND THEN THE CHILDREN MIGHT BE MARRIED BYANDBY SUSAN.YOU WILL NOT GIVE ANY HINT OF THE PLAN TO FRED UNTIL YOU ARE SURETHAT BULSTRODE WOULD AGREE TO THE PLAN SAID MRS. GARTH IN A TONE OFGENTLE CAUTION. AND AS TO MARRIAGE CALEB WE OLD PEOPLE NEED NOT HELPTO HASTEN IT.OH I DONT KNOW SAID CALEB SWINGING HIS HEAD ASIDE. MARRIAGE IS ATAMING THING. FRED WOULD WANT LESS OF MY BIT AND BRIDLE. HOWEVER ISHALL SAY NOTHING TILL I KNOW THE GROUND IM TREADING ON. I SHALL SPEAKTO BULSTRODE AGAIN.HE TOOK HIS EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO. BULSTRODE HAD ANYTHINGBUT A WARM INTEREST IN HIS NEPHEW FRED VINCY BUT HE HAD A STRONG WISHTO SECURE MR. GARTHS SERVICES ON MANY SCATTERED POINTS OF BUSINESS ATWHICH HE WAS SURE TO BE A CONSIDERABLE LOSER IF THEY WERE UNDER LESSCONSCIENTIOUS MANAGEMENT. ON THAT GROUND HE MADE NO OBJECTION TO MR.GARTHS PROPOSAL AND THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER REASON WHY HE WAS NOTSORRY TO GIVE A CONSENT WHICH WAS TO BENEFIT ONE OF THE VINCY FAMILY.IT WAS THAT MRS. BULSTRODE HAVING HEARD OF LYDGATES DEBTS HAD BEENANXIOUS TO KNOW WHETHER HER HUSBAND COULD NOT DO SOMETHING FOR POORROSAMOND AND HAD BEEN MUCH TROUBLED ON LEARNING FROM HIM THATLYDGATES AFFAIRS WERE NOT EASILY REMEDIABLE AND THAT THE WISEST PLANWAS TO LET THEM TAKE THEIR COURSE. MRS. BULSTRODE HAD THEN SAID FORTHE FIRST TIME I THINK YOU ARE ALWAYS A LITTLE HARD TOWARDS MYFAMILY NICHOLAS. AND I AM SURE I HAVE NO REASON TO DENY ANY OF MYRELATIVES. TOO WORLDLY THEY MAY BE BUT NO ONE EVER HAD TO SAY THATTHEY WERE NOT RESPECTABLE.MY DEAR HARRIET SAID MR. BULSTRODE WINCING UNDER HIS WIFES EYESWHICH WERE FILLING WITH TEARS I HAVE SUPPLIED YOUR BROTHER WITH AGREAT DEAL OF CAPITAL. I CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO TAKE CARE OF HIS MARRIEDCHILDREN.THAT SEEMED TO BE TRUE AND MRS. BULSTRODES REMONSTRANCE SUBSIDED INTOPITY FOR POOR ROSAMOND WHOSE EXTRAVAGANT EDUCATION SHE HAD ALWAYSFORESEEN THE FRUITS OF.BUT REMEMBERING THAT DIALOGUE MR. BULSTRODE FELT THAT WHEN HE HAD TOTALK TO HIS WIFE FULLY ABOUT HIS PLAN OF QUITTING MIDDLEMARCH HESHOULD BE GLAD TO TELL HER THAT HE HAD MADE AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH MIGHTBE FOR THE GOOD OF HER NEPHEW FRED. AT PRESENT HE HAD MERELY MENTIONEDTO HER THAT HE THOUGHT OF SHUTTING UP THE SHRUBS FOR A FEW MONTHS ANDTAKING A HOUSE ON THE SOUTHERN COAST.HENCE MR. GARTH GOT THE ASSURANCE HE DESIRED NAMELY THAT IN CASE OFBULSTRODES DEPARTURE FROM MIDDLEMARCH FOR AN INDEFINITE TIME FREDVINCY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HAVE THE TENANCY OF STONE COURT ON THE TERMSPROPOSED.CALEB WAS SO ELATED WITH HIS HOPE OF THIS NEAT TURN BEING GIVEN TOTHINGS THAT IF HIS SELFCONTROL HAD NOT BEEN BRACED BY A LITTLEAFFECTIONATE WIFELY SCOLDING HE WOULD HAVE BETRAYED EVERYTHING TOMARY WANTING TO GIVE THE CHILD COMFORT. HOWEVER HE RESTRAINEDHIMSELF AND KEPT IN STRICT PRIVACY FROM FRED CERTAIN VISITS WHICH HEWAS MAKING TO STONE COURT IN ORDER TO LOOK MORE THOROUGHLY INTO THESTATE OF THE LAND AND STOCK AND TAKE A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE. HE WASCERTAINLY MORE EAGER IN THESE VISITS THAN THE PROBABLE SPEED OF EVENTSREQUIRED HIM TO BE BUT HE WAS STIMULATED BY A FATHERLY DELIGHT INOCCUPYING HIS MIND WITH THIS BIT OF PROBABLE HAPPINESS WHICH HE HELD INSTORE LIKE A HIDDEN BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR FRED AND MARY.BUT SUPPOSE THE WHOLE SCHEME SHOULD TURN OUT TO BE A CASTLE IN THEAIR SAID MRS. GARTH.WELL WELL REPLIED CALEB THE CASTLE WILL TUMBLE ABOUT NOBODYSHEAD.CHAPTER LXIX.IF THOU HAST HEARD A WORD LET IT DIE WITH THEE.ECCLESIASTICUS.MR. BULSTRODE WAS STILL SEATED IN HIS MANAGERS ROOM AT THE BANK ABOUTTHREE OCLOCK OF THE SAME DAY ON WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED LYDGATE THEREWHEN THE CLERK ENTERED TO SAY THAT HIS HORSE WAS WAITING AND ALSO THATMR. GARTH WAS OUTSIDE AND BEGGED TO SPEAK WITH HIM.BY ALL MEANS SAID BULSTRODE AND CALEB ENTERED. PRAY SIT DOWN MR.GARTH CONTINUED THE BANKER IN HIS SUAVEST TONE.I AM GLAD THAT YOU ARRIVED JUST IN TIME TO FIND ME HERE. I KNOW YOUCOUNT YOUR MINUTES.OH SAID CALEB GENTLY WITH A SLOW SWING OF HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE ASHE SEATED HIMSELF AND LAID HIS HAT ON THE FLOOR.HE LOOKED AT THE GROUND LEANING FORWARD AND LETTING HIS LONG FINGERSDROOP BETWEEN HIS LEGS WHILE EACH FINGER MOVED IN SUCCESSION AS IF ITWERE SHARING SOME THOUGHT WHICH FILLED HIS LARGE QUIET BROW.MR. BULSTRODE LIKE EVERY ONE ELSE WHO KNEW CALEB WAS USED TO HISSLOWNESS IN BEGINNING TO SPEAK ON ANY TOPIC WHICH HE FELT TO BEIMPORTANT AND RATHER EXPECTED THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO RECUR TO THE BUYINGOF SOME HOUSES IN BLINDMANS COURT FOR THE SAKE OF PULLING THEM DOWNAS A SACRIFICE OF PROPERTY WHICH WOULD BE WELL REPAID BY THE INFLUX OFAIR AND LIGHT ON THAT SPOT. IT WAS BY PROPOSITIONS OF THIS KIND THATCALEB WAS SOMETIMES TROUBLESOME TO HIS EMPLOYERS BUT HE HAD USUALLYFOUND BULSTRODE READY TO MEET HIM IN PROJECTS OF IMPROVEMENT AND THEYHAD GOT ON WELL TOGETHER. WHEN HE SPOKE AGAIN HOWEVER IT WAS TO SAYIN RATHER A SUBDUED VOICEI HAVE JUST COME AWAY FROM STONE COURT MR. BULSTRODE.YOU FOUND NOTHING WRONG THERE I HOPE SAID THE BANKER I WAS THEREMYSELF YESTERDAY. ABEL HAS DONE WELL WITH THE LAMBS THIS YEAR.WHY YES SAID CALEB LOOKING UP GRAVELY THERE IS SOMETHING WRONGASTRANGER WHO IS VERY ILL I THINK. HE WANTS A DOCTOR AND I CAME TOTELL YOU OF THAT. HIS NAME IS RAFFLES.HE SAW THE SHOCK OF HIS WORDS PASSING THROUGH BULSTRODES FRAME. ONTHIS SUBJECT THE BANKER HAD THOUGHT THAT HIS FEARS WERE TOO CONSTANTLYON THE WATCH TO BE TAKEN BY SURPRISE BUT HE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN.POOR WRETCH HE SAID IN A COMPASSIONATE TONE THOUGH HIS LIPSTREMBLED A LITTLE. DO YOU KNOW HOW HE CAME THEREI TOOK HIM MYSELF SAID CALEB QUIETLYTOOK HIM UP IN MY GIG. HE HADGOT DOWN FROM THE COACH AND WAS WALKING A LITTLE BEYOND THE TURNINGFROM THE TOLLHOUSE AND I OVERTOOK HIM. HE REMEMBERED SEEING ME WITHYOU ONCE BEFORE AT STONE COURT AND HE ASKED ME TO TAKE HIM ON. I SAWHE WAS ILL IT SEEMED TO ME THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO CARRY HIM UNDERSHELTER. AND NOW I THINK YOU SHOULD LOSE NO TIME IN GETTING ADVICE FORHIM. CALEB TOOK UP HIS HAT FROM THE FLOOR AS HE ENDED AND ROSE SLOWLYFROM HIS SEAT.CERTAINLY SAID BULSTRODE WHOSE MIND WAS VERY ACTIVE AT THIS MOMENT.PERHAPS YOU WILL YOURSELF OBLIGE ME MR. GARTH BY CALLING AT MR.LYDGATES AS YOU PASSOR STAY HE MAY AT THIS HOUR PROBABLY BE AT THEHOSPITAL. I WILL FIRST SEND MY MAN ON THE HORSE THERE WITH A NOTE THISINSTANT AND THEN I WILL MYSELF RIDE TO STONE COURT.BULSTRODE QUICKLY WROTE A NOTE AND WENT OUT HIMSELF TO GIVE THECOMMISSION TO HIS MAN. WHEN HE RETURNED CALEB WAS STANDING AS BEFOREWITH ONE HAND ON THE BACK OF THE CHAIR HOLDING HIS HAT WITH THE OTHER.IN BULSTRODES MIND THE DOMINANT THOUGHT WAS PERHAPS RAFFLES ONLYSPOKE TO GARTH OF HIS ILLNESS. GARTH MAY WONDER AS HE MUST HAVE DONEBEFORE AT THIS DISREPUTABLE FELLOWS CLAIMING INTIMACY WITH ME BUT HEWILL KNOW NOTHING. AND HE IS FRIENDLY TO MEI CAN BE OF USE TO HIM.HE LONGED FOR SOME CONFIRMATION OF THIS HOPEFUL CONJECTURE BUT TO HAVEASKED ANY QUESTION AS TO WHAT RAFFLES HAD SAID OR DONE WOULD HAVE BEENTO BETRAY FEAR.I AM EXCEEDINGLY OBLIGED TO YOU MR. GARTH HE SAID IN HIS USUALTONE OF POLITENESS. MY SERVANT WILL BE BACK IN A FEW MINUTES AND ISHALL THEN GO MYSELF TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN.PERHAPS YOU HAD SOME OTHER BUSINESS WITH ME IF SO PRAY BE SEATED.THANK YOU SAID CALEB MAKING A SLIGHT GESTURE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND TOWAIVE THE INVITATION. I WISH TO SAY MR. BULSTRODE THAT I MUSTREQUEST YOU TO PUT YOUR BUSINESS INTO SOME OTHER HANDS THAN MINE. I AMOBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR HANDSOME WAY OF MEETING MEABOUT THE LETTING OFSTONE COURT AND ALL OTHER BUSINESS. BUT I MUST GIVE IT UP. A SHARPCERTAINTY ENTERED LIKE A STAB INTO BULSTRODES SOUL.THIS IS SUDDEN MR. GARTH WAS ALL HE COULD SAY AT FIRST.IT IS SAID CALEB BUT IT IS QUITE FIXED. I MUST GIVE IT UP.HE SPOKE WITH A FIRMNESS WHICH WAS VERY GENTLE AND YET HE COULD SEETHAT BULSTRODE SEEMED TO COWER UNDER THAT GENTLENESS HIS FACE LOOKINGDRIED AND HIS EYES SWERVING AWAY FROM THE GLANCE WHICH RESTED ON HIM.CALEB FELT A DEEP PITY FOR HIM BUT HE COULD HAVE USED NO PRETEXTS TOACCOUNT FOR HIS RESOLVE EVEN IF THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN OF ANY USE.YOU HAVE BEEN LED TO THIS I APPREHEND BY SOME SLANDERS CONCERNING MEUTTERED BY THAT UNHAPPY CREATURE SAID BULSTRODE ANXIOUS NOW TO KNOWTHE UTMOST.THAT IS TRUE. I CANT DENY THAT I ACT UPON WHAT I HEARD FROM HIM.YOU ARE A CONSCIENTIOUS MAN MR. GARTHA MAN I TRUST WHO FEELSHIMSELF ACCOUNTABLE TO GOD. YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO INJURE ME BY BEINGTOO READY TO BELIEVE A SLANDER SAID BULSTRODE CASTING ABOUT FORPLEAS THAT MIGHT BE ADAPTED TO HIS HEARERS MIND. THAT IS A POORREASON FOR GIVING UP A CONNECTION WHICH I THINK I MAY SAY WILL BEMUTUALLY BENEFICIAL.I WOULD INJURE NO MAN IF I COULD HELP IT SAID CALEB EVEN IF ITHOUGHT GOD WINKED AT IT. I HOPE I SHOULD HAVE A FEELING FOR MYFELLOWCREATURE. BUT SIRI AM OBLIGED TO BELIEVE THAT THIS RAFFLES HASTOLD ME THE TRUTH. AND I CANT BE HAPPY IN WORKING WITH YOU ORPROFITING BY YOU. IT HURTS MY MIND. I MUST BEG YOU TO SEEK ANOTHERAGENT.VERY WELL MR. GARTH. BUT I MUST AT LEAST CLAIM TO KNOW THE WORST THATHE HAS TOLD YOU. I MUST KNOW WHAT IS THE FOUL SPEECH THAT I AM LIABLETO BE THE VICTIM OF SAID BULSTRODE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ANGERBEGINNING TO MINGLE WITH HIS HUMILIATION BEFORE THIS QUIET MAN WHORENOUNCED HIS BENEFITS.THATS NEEDLESS SAID CALEB WAVING HIS HAND BOWING HIS HEADSLIGHTLY AND NOT SWERVING FROM THE TONE WHICH HAD IN IT THE MERCIFULINTENTION TO SPARE THIS PITIABLE MAN. WHAT HE HAS SAID TO ME WILLNEVER PASS FROM MY LIPS UNLESS SOMETHING NOW UNKNOWN FORCES IT FROMME. IF YOU LED A HARMFUL LIFE FOR GAIN AND KEPT OTHERS OUT OF THEIRRIGHTS BY DECEIT TO GET THE MORE FOR YOURSELF I DARE SAY YOUREPENTYOU WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK AND CANT THAT MUST BE A BITTERTHINGCALEB PAUSED A MOMENT AND SHOOK HIS HEADIT IS NOT FOR ME TOMAKE YOUR LIFE HARDER TO YOU.BUT YOU DOYOU DO MAKE IT HARDER TO ME SAID BULSTRODE CONSTRAINEDINTO A GENUINE PLEADING CRY. YOU MAKE IT HARDER TO ME BY TURNING YOURBACK ON ME.THAT IM FORCED TO DO SAID CALEB STILL MORE GENTLY LIFTING UP HISHAND. I AM SORRY. I DONT JUDGE YOU AND SAY HE IS WICKED AND I AMRIGHTEOUS.

BUT I HAVE THAT FEELING INSIDE ME THAT I CANT GO ON WORKING WITHYOU. THATS ALL MR. BULSTRODE. EVERYTHING ELSE IS BURIED SO FAR AS MYWILL GOES. AND I WISH YOU GOODDAY.ONE MOMENT MR. GARTH SAID BULSTRODE HURRIEDLY. I MAY TRUST THENTO YOUR SOLEMN ASSURANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT REPEAT EITHER TO MAN ORWOMAN WHATEVEN IF IT HAVE ANY DEGREE OF TRUTH IN ITIS YET A MALICIOUSREPRESENTATION CALEBS WRATH WAS STIRRED AND HE SAID INDIGNANTLYWHY SHOULD I HAVE SAID IT IF I DIDNT MEAN IT I AM IN NO FEAR OF YOU.SUCH TALES AS THAT WILL NEVER TEMPT MY TONGUE.EXCUSE MEI AM AGITATEDI AM THE VICTIM OF THIS ABANDONED MAN.STOP A BIT YOU HAVE GOT TO CONSIDER WHETHER YOU DIDNT HELP TO MAKEHIM WORSE WHEN YOU PROFITED BY HIS VICES.YOU ARE WRONGING ME BY TOO READILY BELIEVING HIM SAID BULSTRODEOPPRESSED AS BY A NIGHTMARE WITH THE INABILITY TO DENY FLATLY WHATRAFFLES MIGHT HAVE SAID AND YET FEELING IT AN ESCAPE THAT CALEB HADNOT SO STATED IT TO HIM AS TO ASK FOR THAT FLAT DENIAL.NO SAID CALEB LIFTING HIS HAND DEPRECATINGLY I AM READY TOBELIEVE BETTER WHEN BETTER IS PROVED. I ROB YOU OF NO GOOD CHANCE. ASTO SPEAKING I HOLD IT A CRIME TO EXPOSE A MANS SIN UNLESS IM CLEARIT MUST BE DONE TO SAVE THE INNOCENT. THAT IS MY WAY OF THINKING MR.BULSTRODE AND WHAT I SAY IVE NO NEED TO SWEAR. I WISH YOU GOODDAY.SOME HOURS LATER WHEN HE WAS AT HOME CALEB SAID TO HIS WIFEINCIDENTALLY THAT HE HAD HAD SOME LITTLE DIFFERENCES WITH BULSTRODEAND THAT IN CONSEQUENCE HE HAD GIVEN UP ALL NOTION OF TAKING STONECOURT AND INDEED HAD RESIGNED DOING FURTHER BUSINESS FOR HIM.HE WAS DISPOSED TO INTERFERE TOO MUCH WAS HE SAID MRS. GARTHIMAGINING THAT HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN TOUCHED ON HIS SENSITIVE POINT ANDNOT BEEN ALLOWED TO DO WHAT HE THOUGHT RIGHT AS TO MATERIALS AND MODESOF WORK.OH SAID CALEB BOWING HIS HEAD AND WAVING HIS HAND GRAVELY. AND MRS.GARTH KNEW THAT THIS WAS A SIGN OF HIS NOT INTENDING TO SPEAK FURTHERON THE SUBJECT.AS FOR BULSTRODE HE HAD ALMOST IMMEDIATELY MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND SETOFF FOR STONE COURT BEING ANXIOUS TO ARRIVE THERE BEFORE LYDGATE.HIS MIND WAS CROWDED WITH IMAGES AND CONJECTURES WHICH WERE A LANGUAGETO HIS HOPES AND FEARS JUST AS WE HEAR TONES FROM THE VIBRATIONS WHICHSHAKE OUR WHOLE SYSTEM. THE DEEP HUMILIATION WITH WHICH HE HAD WINCEDUNDER CALEB GARTHS KNOWLEDGE OF HIS PAST AND REJECTION OF HISPATRONAGE ALTERNATED WITH AND ALMOST GAVE WAY TO THE SENSE OF SAFETYIN THE FACT THAT GARTH AND NO OTHER HAD BEEN THE MAN TO WHOM RAFFLESHAD SPOKEN. IT SEEMED TO HIM A SORT OF EARNEST THAT PROVIDENCE INTENDEDHIS RESCUE FROM WORSE CONSEQUENCES THE WAY BEING THUS LEFT OPEN FORTHE HOPE OF SECRECY. THAT RAFFLES SHOULD BE AFFLICTED WITH ILLNESSTHAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LED TO STONE COURT RATHER THANELSEWHEREBULSTRODES HEART FLUTTERED AT THE VISION OF PROBABILITIESWHICH THESE EVENTS CONJURED UP. IF IT SHOULD TURN OUT THAT HE WAS FREEDFROM ALL DANGER OF DISGRACEIF HE COULD BREATHE IN PERFECT LIBERTYHISLIFE SHOULD BE MORE CONSECRATED THAN IT HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE. HEMENTALLY LIFTED UP THIS VOW AS IF IT WOULD URGE THE RESULT HE LONGEDFORHE TRIED TO BELIEVE IN THE POTENCY OF THAT PRAYERFUL RESOLUTIONITSPOTENCY TO DETERMINE DEATH. HE KNEW THAT HE OUGHT TO SAY THY WILL BEDONE AND HE SAID IT OFTEN. BUT THE INTENSE DESIRE REMAINED THAT THEWILL OF GOD MIGHT BE THE DEATH OF THAT HATED MAN.YET WHEN HE ARRIVED AT STONE COURT HE COULD NOT SEE THE CHANGE INRAFFLES WITHOUT A SHOCK. BUT FOR HIS PALLOR AND FEEBLENESS BULSTRODEWOULD HAVE CALLED THE CHANGE IN HIM ENTIRELY MENTAL. INSTEAD OF HISLOUD TORMENTING MOOD HE SHOWED AN INTENSE VAGUE TERROR AND SEEMED TODEPRECATE BULSTRODES ANGER BECAUSE THE MONEY WAS ALL GONEHE HAD BEENROBBEDIT HAD HALF OF IT BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM. HE HAD ONLY COME HEREBECAUSE HE WAS ILL AND SOMEBODY WAS HUNTING HIMSOMEBODY WAS AFTER HIMHE HAD TOLD NOBODY ANYTHING HE HAD KEPT HIS MOUTH SHUT. BULSTRODE NOTKNOWING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE SYMPTOMS INTERPRETED THIS NEWNERVOUS SUSCEPTIBILITY INTO A MEANS OF ALARMING RAFFLES INTO TRUECONFESSIONS AND TAXED HIM WITH FALSEHOOD IN SAYING THAT HE HAD NOTTOLD ANYTHING SINCE HE HAD JUST TOLD THE MAN WHO TOOK HIM UP IN HISGIG AND BROUGHT HIM TO STONE COURT. RAFFLES DENIED THIS WITH SOLEMNADJURATIONS THE FACT BEING THAT THE LINKS OF CONSCIOUSNESS WEREINTERRUPTED IN HIM AND THAT HIS MINUTE TERRORSTRICKEN NARRATIVE TOCALEB GARTH HAD BEEN DELIVERED UNDER A SET OF VISIONARY IMPULSES WHICHHAD DROPPED BACK INTO DARKNESS.BULSTRODES HEART SANK AGAIN AT THIS SIGN THAT HE COULD GET NO GRASPOVER THE WRETCHED MANS MIND AND THAT NO WORD OF RAFFLES COULD BETRUSTED AS TO THE FACT WHICH HE MOST WANTED TO KNOW NAMELY WHETHER ORNOT HE HAD REALLY KEPT SILENCE TO EVERY ONE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD EXCEPTCALEB GARTH. THE HOUSEKEEPER HAD TOLD HIM WITHOUT THE LEAST CONSTRAINTOF MANNER THAT SINCE MR. GARTH LEFT RAFFLES HAD ASKED HER FOR BEERAND AFTER THAT HAD NOT SPOKEN SEEMING VERY ILL. ON THAT SIDE IT MIGHTBE CONCLUDED THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO BETRAYAL. MRS. ABEL THOUGHT LIKETHE SERVANTS AT THE SHRUBS THAT THE STRANGE MAN BELONGED TO THEUNPLEASANT KIN WHO ARE AMONG THE TROUBLES OF THE RICH SHE HAD ATFIRST REFERRED THE KINSHIP TO MR. RIGG AND WHERE THERE WAS PROPERTYLEFT THE BUZZING PRESENCE OF SUCH LARGE BLUEBOTTLES SEEMED NATURALENOUGH. HOW HE COULD BE KIN TO BULSTRODE AS WELL WAS NOT SO CLEARBUT MRS. ABEL AGREED WITH HER HUSBAND THAT THERE WAS NO KNOWING APROPOSITION WHICH HAD A GREAT DEAL OF MENTAL FOOD FOR HER SO THAT SHESHOOK HER HEAD OVER IT WITHOUT FURTHER SPECULATION.IN LESS THAN AN HOUR LYDGATE ARRIVED. BULSTRODE MET HIM OUTSIDE THEWAINSCOTED PARLOR WHERE RAFFLES WAS AND SAIDI HAVE CALLED YOU IN MR. LYDGATE TO AN UNFORTUNATE MAN WHO WAS ONCEIN MY EMPLOYMENT MANY YEARS AGO. AFTERWARDS HE WENT TO AMERICA ANDRETURNED I FEAR TO AN IDLE DISSOLUTE LIFE. BEING DESTITUTE HE HAS ACLAIM ON ME. HE WAS SLIGHTLY CONNECTED WITH RIGG THE FORMER OWNER OFTHIS PLACE AND IN CONSEQUENCE FOUND HIS WAY HERE. I BELIEVE HE ISSERIOUSLY ILL APPARENTLY HIS MIND IS AFFECTED. I FEEL BOUND TO DO THEUTMOST FOR HIM.LYDGATE WHO HAD THE REMEMBRANCE OF HIS LAST CONVERSATION WITHBULSTRODE STRONGLY UPON HIM WAS NOT DISPOSED TO SAY AN UNNECESSARYWORD TO HIM AND BOWED SLIGHTLY IN ANSWER TO THIS ACCOUNT BUT JUSTBEFORE ENTERING THE ROOM HE TURNED AUTOMATICALLY AND SAID WHAT IS HISNAMETO KNOW NAMES BEING AS MUCH A PART OF THE MEDICAL MANSACCOMPLISHMENT AS OF THE PRACTICAL POLITICIANS.RAFFLES JOHN RAFFLES SAID BULSTRODE WHO HOPED THAT WHATEVER BECAMEOF RAFFLES LYDGATE WOULD NEVER KNOW ANY MORE OF HIM.WHEN HE HAD THOROUGHLY EXAMINED AND CONSIDERED THE PATIENT LYDGATEORDERED THAT HE SHOULD GO TO BED AND BE KEPT THERE IN AS COMPLETEQUIET AS POSSIBLE AND THEN WENT WITH BULSTRODE INTO ANOTHER ROOM.IT IS A SERIOUS CASE I APPREHEND SAID THE BANKER BEFORE LYDGATEBEGAN TO SPEAK.NOAND YES SAID LYDGATE HALF DUBIOUSLY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO DECIDEAS TO THE POSSIBLE EFFECT OF LONGSTANDING COMPLICATIONS BUT THE MANHAD A ROBUST CONSTITUTION TO BEGIN WITH. I SHOULD NOT EXPECT THISATTACK TO BE FATAL THOUGH OF COURSE THE SYSTEM IS IN A TICKLISH STATE.HE SHOULD BE WELL WATCHED AND ATTENDED TO.I WILL REMAIN HERE MYSELF SAID BULSTRODE. MRS. ABEL AND HER HUSBANDARE INEXPERIENCED. I CAN EASILY REMAIN HERE FOR THE NIGHT IF YOU WILLOBLIGE ME BY TAKING A NOTE FOR MRS. BULSTRODE.I SHOULD THINK THAT IS HARDLY NECESSARY SAID LYDGATE. HE SEEMS TAMEAND TERRIFIED ENOUGH. HE MIGHT BECOME MORE UNMANAGEABLE. BUT THERE IS AMAN HEREIS THERE NOTI HAVE MORE THAN ONCE STAYED HERE A FEW NIGHTS FOR THE SAKE OFSECLUSION SAID BULSTRODE INDIFFERENTLY I AM QUITE DISPOSED TO DOSO NOW. MRS. ABEL AND HER HUSBAND CAN RELIEVE OR AID ME IF NECESSARY.VERY WELL. THEN I NEED GIVE MY DIRECTIONS ONLY TO YOU SAID LYDGATENOT FEELING SURPRISED AT A LITTLE PECULIARITY IN BULSTRODE.YOU THINK THEN THAT THE CASE IS HOPEFUL SAID BULSTRODE WHENLYDGATE HAD ENDED GIVING HIS ORDERS.UNLESS THERE TURN OUT TO BE FURTHER COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS I HAVE NOTAT PRESENT DETECTEDYES SAID LYDGATE. HE MAY PASS ON TO A WORSESTAGE BUT I SHOULD NOT WONDER IF HE GOT BETTER IN A FEW DAYS BYADHERING TO THE TREATMENT I HAVE PRESCRIBED. THERE MUST BE FIRMNESS.REMEMBER IF HE CALLS FOR LIQUORS OF ANY SORT NOT TO GIVE THEM TO HIM.IN MY OPINION MEN IN HIS CONDITION ARE OFTENER KILLED BY TREATMENTTHAN BY THE DISEASE. STILL NEW SYMPTOMS MAY ARISE. I SHALL COME AGAINTOMORROW MORNING.AFTER WAITING FOR THE NOTE TO BE CARRIED TO MRS. BULSTRODE LYDGATERODE AWAY FORMING NO CONJECTURES IN THE FIRST INSTANCE ABOUT THEHISTORY OF RAFFLES BUT REHEARSING THE WHOLE ARGUMENT WHICH HAD LATELYBEEN MUCH STIRRED BY THE PUBLICATION OF DR. WARES ABUNDANT EXPERIENCEIN AMERICA AS TO THE RIGHT WAY OF TREATING CASES OF ALCOHOLICPOISONING SUCH AS THIS. LYDGATE WHEN ABROAD HAD ALREADY BEENINTERESTED IN THIS QUESTION HE WAS STRONGLY CONVINCED AGAINST THEPREVALENT PRACTICE OF ALLOWING ALCOHOL AND PERSISTENTLY ADMINISTERINGLARGE DOSES OF OPIUM AND HE HAD REPEATEDLY ACTED ON THIS CONVICTIONWITH A FAVORABLE RESULT.THE MAN IS IN A DISEASED STATE HE THOUGHT BUT THERES A GOOD DEALOF WEAR IN HIM STILL. I SUPPOSE HE IS AN OBJECT OF CHARITY TOBULSTRODE. IT IS CURIOUS WHAT PATCHES OF HARDNESS AND TENDERNESS LIESIDE BY SIDE IN MENS DISPOSITIONS. BULSTRODE SEEMS THE MOSTUNSYMPATHETIC FELLOW I EVER SAW ABOUT SOME PEOPLE AND YET HE HAS TAKENNO END OF TROUBLE AND SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY ON BENEVOLENTOBJECTS. I SUPPOSE HE HAS SOME TEST BY WHICH HE FINDS OUT WHOM HEAVENCARES FORHE HAS MADE UP HIS MIND THAT IT DOESNT CARE FOR ME.THIS STREAK OF BITTERNESS CAME FROM A PLENTEOUS SOURCE AND KEPTWIDENING IN THE CURRENT OF HIS THOUGHT AS HE NEARED LOWICK GATE. HE HADNOT BEEN THERE SINCE HIS FIRST INTERVIEW WITH BULSTRODE IN THE MORNINGHAVING BEEN FOUND AT THE HOSPITAL BY THE BANKERS MESSENGER AND FORTHE FIRST TIME HE WAS RETURNING TO HIS HOME WITHOUT THE VISION OF ANYEXPEDIENT IN THE BACKGROUND WHICH LEFT HIM A HOPE OF RAISING MONEYENOUGH TO DELIVER HIM FROM THE COMING DESTITUTION OF EVERYTHING WHICHMADE HIS MARRIED LIFE TOLERABLEEVERYTHING WHICH SAVED HIM AND ROSAMONDFROM THAT BARE ISOLATION IN WHICH THEY WOULD BE FORCED TO RECOGNIZE HOWLITTLE OF A COMFORT THEY COULD BE TO EACH OTHER. IT WAS MORE BEARABLETO DO WITHOUT TENDERNESS FOR HIMSELF THAN TO SEE THAT HIS OWNTENDERNESS COULD MAKE NO AMENDS FOR THE LACK OF OTHER THINGS TO HER.THE SUFFERINGS OF HIS OWN PRIDE FROM HUMILIATIONS PAST AND TO COME WEREKEEN ENOUGH YET THEY WERE HARDLY DISTINGUISHABLE TO HIMSELF FROM THATMORE ACUTE PAIN WHICH DOMINATED THEMTHE PAIN OF FORESEEING THATROSAMOND WOULD COME TO REGARD HIM CHIEFLY AS THE CAUSE OFDISAPPOINTMENT AND UNHAPPINESS TO HER. HE HAD NEVER LIKED THEMAKESHIFTS OF POVERTY AND THEY HAD NEVER BEFORE ENTERED INTO HISPROSPECTS FOR HIMSELF BUT HE WAS BEGINNING NOW TO IMAGINE HOW TWOCREATURES WHO LOVED EACH OTHER AND HAD A STOCK OF THOUGHTS IN COMMONMIGHT LAUGH OVER THEIR SHABBY FURNITURE AND THEIR CALCULATIONS HOW FARTHEY COULD AFFORD BUTTER AND EGGS. BUT THE GLIMPSE OF THAT POETRYSEEMED AS FAR OFF FROM HIM AS THE CARELESSNESS OF THE GOLDEN AGE INPOOR ROSAMONDS MIND THERE WAS NOT ROOM ENOUGH FOR LUXURIES TO LOOKSMALL IN. HE GOT DOWN FROM HIS HORSE IN A VERY SAD MOOD AND WENT INTOTHE HOUSE NOT EXPECTING TO BE CHEERED EXCEPT BY HIS DINNER ANDREFLECTING THAT BEFORE THE EVENING CLOSED IT WOULD BE WISE TO TELLROSAMOND OF HIS APPLICATION TO BULSTRODE AND ITS FAILURE. IT WOULD BEWELL NOT TO LOSE TIME IN PREPARING HER FOR THE WORST.BUT HIS DINNER WAITED LONG FOR HIM BEFORE HE WAS ABLE TO EAT IT. FOR ONENTERING HE FOUND THAT DOVERS AGENT HAD ALREADY PUT A MAN IN THEHOUSE AND WHEN HE ASKED WHERE MRS. LYDGATE WAS HE WAS TOLD THAT SHEWAS IN HER BEDROOM. HE WENT UP AND FOUND HER STRETCHED ON THE BED PALEAND SILENT WITHOUT AN ANSWER EVEN IN HER FACE TO ANY WORD OR LOOK OFHIS. HE SAT DOWN BY THE BED AND LEANING OVER HER SAID WITH ALMOST A CRYOF PRAYERFORGIVE ME FOR THIS MISERY MY POOR ROSAMOND LET US ONLY LOVE ONEANOTHER.SHE LOOKED AT HIM SILENTLY STILL WITH THE BLANK DESPAIR ON HER FACEBUT THEN THE TEARS BEGAN TO FILL HER BLUE EYES AND HER LIP TREMBLED.THE STRONG MAN HAD HAD TOO MUCH TO BEAR THAT DAY. HE LET HIS HEAD FALLBESIDE HERS AND SOBBED.HE DID NOT HINDER HER FROM GOING TO HER FATHER EARLY IN THE MORNINGITSEEMED NOW THAT HE OUGHT NOT TO HINDER HER FROM DOING AS SHE PLEASED.IN HALF AN HOUR SHE CAME BACK AND SAID THAT PAPA AND MAMMA WISHED HERTO GO AND STAY WITH THEM WHILE THINGS WERE IN THIS MISERABLE STATE.PAPA SAID HE COULD DO NOTHING ABOUT THE DEBTIF HE PAID THIS THEREWOULD BE HALFADOZEN MORE. SHE HAD BETTER COME BACK HOME AGAIN TILLLYDGATE HAD GOT A COMFORTABLE HOME FOR HER. DO YOU OBJECT TERTIUSDO AS YOU LIKE SAID LYDGATE. BUT THINGS ARE NOT COMING TO A CRISISIMMEDIATELY. THERE IS NO HURRY.I SHOULD NOT GO TILL TOMORROW SAID ROSAMOND I SHALL WANT TO PACKMY CLOTHES.OH I WOULD WAIT A LITTLE LONGER THAN TOMORROWTHERE IS NO KNOWINGWHAT MAY HAPPEN SAID LYDGATE WITH BITTER IRONY. I MAY GET MY NECKBROKEN AND THAT MAY MAKE THINGS EASIER TO YOU.IT WAS LYDGATES MISFORTUNE AND ROSAMONDS TOO THAT HIS TENDERNESSTOWARDS HER WHICH WAS BOTH AN EMOTIONAL PROMPTING AND AWELLCONSIDERED RESOLVE WAS INEVITABLY INTERRUPTED BY THESE OUTBURSTSOF INDIGNATION EITHER IRONICAL OR REMONSTRANT. SHE THOUGHT THEM TOTALLYUNWARRANTED AND THE REPULSION WHICH THIS EXCEPTIONAL SEVERITY EXCITEDIN HER WAS IN DANGER OF MAKING THE MORE PERSISTENT TENDERNESSUNACCEPTABLE.I SEE YOU DO NOT WISH ME TO GO SHE SAID WITH CHILL MILDNESS WHYCAN YOU NOT SAY SO WITHOUT THAT KIND OF VIOLENCE I SHALL STAY UNTILYOU REQUEST ME TO DO OTHERWISE.LYDGATE SAID NO MORE BUT WENT OUT ON HIS ROUNDS. HE FELT BRUISED ANDSHATTERED AND THERE WAS A DARK LINE UNDER HIS EYES WHICH ROSAMOND HADNOT SEEN BEFORE. SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO LOOK AT HIM. TERTIUS HAD A WAYOF TAKING THINGS WHICH MADE THEM A GREAT DEAL WORSE FOR HER.CHAPTER LXX.OUR DEEDS STILL TRAVEL WITH US FROM AFARAND WHAT WE HAVE BEEN MAKES US WHAT WE ARE.BULSTRODES FIRST OBJECT AFTER LYDGATE HAD LEFT STONE COURT WAS TOEXAMINE RAFFLESS POCKETS WHICH HE IMAGINED WERE SURE TO CARRY SIGNSIN THE SHAPE OF HOTELBILLS OF THE PLACES HE HAD STOPPED IN IF HE HADNOT TOLD THE TRUTH IN SAYING THAT HE HAD COME STRAIGHT FROM LIVERPOOLBECAUSE HE WAS ILL AND HAD NO MONEY. THERE WERE VARIOUS BILLS CRAMMEDINTO HIS POCKETBOOK BUT NONE OF A LATER DATE THAN CHRISTMAS AT ANYOTHER PLACE EXCEPT ONE WHICH BORE DATE THAT MORNING. THIS WASCRUMPLED UP WITH A HANDBILL ABOUT A HORSEFAIR IN ONE OF HISTAILPOCKETS AND REPRESENTED THE COST OF THREE DAYS STAY AT AN INN ATBILKLEY WHERE THE FAIR WAS HELDA TOWN AT LEAST FORTY MILES FROMMIDDLEMARCH. THE BILL WAS HEAVY AND SINCE RAFFLES HAD NO LUGGAGE WITHHIM IT SEEMED PROBABLE THAT HE HAD LEFT HIS PORTMANTEAU BEHIND INPAYMENT IN ORDER TO SAVE MONEY FOR HIS TRAVELLING FARE FOR HIS PURSEWAS EMPTY AND HE HAD ONLY A COUPLE OF SIXPENCES AND SOME LOOSE PENCEIN HIS POCKETS.BULSTRODE GATHERED A SENSE OF SAFETY FROM THESE INDICATIONS THATRAFFLES HAD REALLY KEPT AT A DISTANCE FROM MIDDLEMARCH SINCE HISMEMORABLE VISIT AT CHRISTMAS. AT A DISTANCE AND AMONG PEOPLE WHO WERESTRANGERS TO BULSTRODE WHAT SATISFACTION COULD THERE BE TO RAFFLESSTORMENTING SELFMAGNIFYING VEIN IN TELLING OLD SCANDALOUS STORIESABOUT A MIDDLEMARCH BANKER AND WHAT HARM IF HE DID TALK THE CHIEFPOINT NOW WAS TO KEEP WATCH OVER HIM AS LONG AS THERE WAS ANY DANGER OFTHAT INTELLIGIBLE RAVING THAT UNACCOUNTABLE IMPULSE TO TELL WHICHSEEMED TO HAVE ACTED TOWARDS CALEB GARTH AND BULSTRODE FELT MUCHANXIETY LEST SOME SUCH IMPULSE SHOULD COME OVER HIM AT THE SIGHT OFLYDGATE. HE SAT UP ALONE WITH HIM THROUGH THE NIGHT ONLY ORDERING THEHOUSEKEEPER TO LIE DOWN IN HER CLOTHES SO AS TO BE READY WHEN HECALLED HER ALLEGING HIS OWN INDISPOSITION TO SLEEP AND HIS ANXIETY TOCARRY OUT THE DOCTORS ORDERS. HE DID CARRY THEM OUT FAITHFULLYALTHOUGH RAFFLES WAS INCESSANTLY ASKING FOR BRANDY AND DECLARING THATHE WAS SINKING AWAYTHAT THE EARTH WAS SINKING AWAY FROM UNDER HIM. HEWAS RESTLESS AND SLEEPLESS BUT STILL QUAILING AND MANAGEABLE. ON THEOFFER OF THE FOOD ORDERED BY LYDGATE WHICH HE REFUSED AND THE DENIALOF OTHER THINGS WHICH HE DEMANDED HE SEEMED TO CONCENTRATE ALL HISTERROR ON BULSTRODE IMPLORINGLY DEPRECATING HIS ANGER HIS REVENGE ONHIM BY STARVATION AND DECLARING WITH STRONG OATHS THAT HE HAD NEVERTOLD ANY MORTAL A WORD AGAINST HIM. EVEN THIS BULSTRODE FELT THAT HEWOULD NOT HAVE LIKED LYDGATE TO HEAR BUT A MORE ALARMING SIGN OFFITFUL ALTERNATION IN HIS DELIRIUM WAS THAT INTHE MORNING TWILIGHTRAFFLES SUDDENLY SEEMED TO IMAGINE A DOCTOR PRESENT ADDRESSING HIM ANDDECLARING THAT BULSTRODE WANTED TO STARVE HIM TO DEATH OUT OF REVENGEFOR TELLING WHEN HE NEVER HAD TOLD.BULSTRODES NATIVE IMPERIOUSNESS AND STRENGTH OF DETERMINATION SERVEDHIM WELL. THIS DELICATELOOKING MAN HIMSELF NERVOUSLY PERTURBED FOUNDTHE NEEDED STIMULUS IN HIS STRENUOUS CIRCUMSTANCES AND THROUGH THATDIFFICULT NIGHT AND MORNING WHILE HE HAD THE AIR OF AN ANIMATED CORPSERETURNED TO MOVEMENT WITHOUT WARMTH HOLDING THE MASTERY BY ITS CHILLIMPASSIBILITY HIS MIND WAS INTENSELY AT WORK THINKING OF WHAT HE HADTO GUARD AGAINST AND WHAT WOULD WIN HIM SECURITY. WHATEVER PRAYERS HEMIGHT LIFT UP WHATEVER STATEMENTS HE MIGHT INWARDLY MAKE OF THIS MANSWRETCHED SPIRITUAL CONDITION AND THE DUTY HE HIMSELF WAS UNDER TOSUBMIT TO THE PUNISHMENT DIVINELY APPOINTED FOR HIM RATHER THAN TO WISHFOR EVIL TO ANOTHERTHROUGH ALL THIS EFFORT TO CONDENSE WORDS INTO ASOLID MENTAL STATE THERE PIERCED AND SPREAD WITH IRRESISTIBLEVIVIDNESS THE IMAGES OF THE EVENTS HE DESIRED. AND IN THE TRAIN OFTHOSE IMAGES CAME THEIR APOLOGY. HE COULD NOT BUT SEE THE DEATH OFRAFFLES AND SEE IN IT HIS OWN DELIVERANCE. WHAT WAS THE REMOVAL OFTHIS WRETCHED CREATURE HE WAS IMPENITENTBUT WERE NOT PUBLIC CRIMINALSIMPENITENTYET THE LAW DECIDED ON THEIR FATE. SHOULD PROVIDENCE INTHIS CASE AWARD DEATH THERE WAS NO SIN IN CONTEMPLATING DEATH AS THEDESIRABLE ISSUEIF HE KEPT HIS HANDS FROM HASTENING ITIF HESCRUPULOUSLY DID WHAT WAS PRESCRIBED. EVEN HERE THERE MIGHT BE AMISTAKE HUMAN PRESCRIPTIONS WERE FALLIBLE THINGS LYDGATE HAD SAIDTHAT TREATMENT HAD HASTENED DEATHWHY NOT HIS OWN METHOD OF TREATMENTBUT OF COURSE INTENTION WAS EVERYTHING IN THE QUESTION OF RIGHT ANDWRONG.AND BULSTRODE SET HIMSELF TO KEEP HIS INTENTION SEPARATE FROM HISDESIRE. HE INWARDLY DECLARED THAT HE INTENDED TO OBEY ORDERS. WHYSHOULD HE HAVE GOT INTO ANY ARGUMENT ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF THESEORDERS IT WAS ONLY THE COMMON TRICK OF DESIREWHICH AVAILS ITSELF OFANY IRRELEVANT SCEPTICISM FINDING LARGER ROOM FOR ITSELF IN ALLUNCERTAINTY ABOUT EFFECTS IN EVERY OBSCURITY THAT LOOKS LIKE THEABSENCE OF LAW. STILL HE DID OBEY THE ORDERS.HIS ANXIETIES CONTINUALLY GLANCED TOWARDS LYDGATE AND HIS REMEMBRANCEOF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THEM THE MORNING BEFORE WAS ACCOMPANIEDWITH SENSIBILITIES WHICH HAD NOT BEEN ROUSED AT ALL DURING THE ACTUALSCENE. HE HAD THEN CARED BUT LITTLE ABOUT LYDGATES PAINFUL IMPRESSIONSWITH REGARD TO THE SUGGESTED CHANGE IN THE HOSPITAL OR ABOUT THEDISPOSITION TOWARDS HIMSELF WHICH WHAT HE HELD TO BE HIS JUSTIFIABLEREFUSAL OF A RATHER EXORBITANT REQUEST MIGHT CALL FORTH. HE RECURRED TOTHE SCENE NOW WITH A PERCEPTION THAT HE HAD PROBABLY MADE LYDGATE HISENEMY AND WITH AN AWAKENED DESIRE TO PROPITIATE HIM OR RATHER TOCREATE IN HIM A STRONG SENSE OF PERSONAL OBLIGATION. HE REGRETTED THATHE HAD NOT AT ONCE MADE EVEN AN UNREASONABLE MONEYSACRIFICE. FOR INCASE OF UNPLEASANT SUSPICIONS OR EVEN KNOWLEDGE GATHERED FROM THERAVING OF RAFFLES BULSTRODE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT HE HAD A DEFENCE INLYDGATES MIND BY HAVING CONFERRED A MOMENTOUS BENEFIT ON HIM. BUT THEREGRET HAD PERHAPS COME TOO LATE.STRANGE PITEOUS CONFLICT IN THE SOUL OF THIS UNHAPPY MAN WHO HADLONGED FOR YEARS TO BE BETTER THAN HE WASWHO HAD TAKEN HIS SELFISHPASSIONS INTO DISCIPLINE AND CLAD THEM IN SEVERE ROBES SO THAT HE HADWALKED WITH THEM AS A DEVOUT CHOIR TILL NOW THAT A TERROR HAD RISENAMONG THEM AND THEY COULD CHANT NO LONGER BUT THREW OUT THEIR COMMONCRIES FOR SAFETY.IT WAS NEARLY THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY BEFORE LYDGATE ARRIVED HE HADMEANT TO COME EARLIER BUT HAD BEEN DETAINED HE SAID AND HISSHATTERED LOOKS WERE NOTICED BY BALSTRODE. BUT HE IMMEDIATELY THREWHIMSELF INTO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE PATIENT AND INQUIRED STRICTLYINTO ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED. RAFFLES WAS WORSE WOULD TAKE HARDLY ANYFOOD WAS PERSISTENTLY WAKEFUL AND RESTLESSLY RAVING BUT STILL NOTVIOLENT. CONTRARY TO BULSTRODES ALARMED EXPECTATION HE TOOK LITTLENOTICE OF LYDGATES PRESENCE AND CONTINUED TO TALK OR MURMURINCOHERENTLY.WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM SAID BULSTRODE IN PRIVATE.THE SYMPTOMS ARE WORSE.YOU ARE LESS HOPEFULNO I STILL THINK HE MAY COME ROUND. ARE YOU GOING TO STAY HEREYOURSELF SAID LYDGATE LOOKING AT BULSTRODE WITH AN ABRUPT QUESTIONWHICH MADE HIM UNEASY THOUGH IN REALITY IT WAS NOT DUE TO ANYSUSPICIOUS CONJECTURE.YES I THINK SO SAID BULSTRODE GOVERNING HIMSELF AND SPEAKING WITHDELIBERATION. MRS. BULSTRODE IS ADVISED OF THE REASONS WHICH DETAINME. MRS. ABEL AND HER HUSBAND ARE NOT EXPERIENCED ENOUGH TO BE LEFTQUITE ALONE AND THIS KIND OF RESPONSIBILITY IS SCARCELY INCLUDED INTHEIR SERVICE OF ME. YOU HAVE SOME FRESH INSTRUCTIONS I PRESUME.THE CHIEF NEW INSTRUCTION THAT LYDGATE HAD TO GIVE WAS ON THEADMINISTRATION OF EXTREMELY MODERATE DOSES OF OPIUM IN CASE OF THESLEEPLESSNESS CONTINUING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. HE HAD TAKEN THEPRECAUTION OF BRINGING OPIUM IN HIS POCKET AND HE GAVE MINUTEDIRECTIONS TO BULSTRODE AS TO THE DOSES AND THE POINT AT WHICH THEYSHOULD CEASE. HE INSISTED ON THE RISK OF NOT CEASING AND REPEATED HISORDER THAT NO ALCOHOL SHOULD BE GIVEN.FROM WHAT I SEE OF THE CASE HE ENDED NARCOTISM IS THE ONLY THING ISHOULD BE MUCH AFRAID OF. HE MAY WEAR THROUGH EVEN WITHOUT MUCH FOOD.THERES A GOOD DEAL OF STRENGTH IN HIM.YOU LOOK ILL YOURSELF MR. LYDGATEA MOST UNUSUAL I MAY SAYUNPRECEDENTED THING IN MY KNOWLEDGE OF YOU SAID BULSTRODE SHOWING ASOLICITUDE AS UNLIKE HIS INDIFFERENCE THE DAY BEFORE AS HIS PRESENTRECKLESSNESS ABOUT HIS OWN FATIGUE WAS UNLIKE HIS HABITUALSELFCHERISHING ANXIETY. I FEAR YOU ARE HARASSED.YES I AM SAID LYDGATE BRUSQUELY HOLDING HIS HAT AND READY TO GO.SOMETHING NEW I FEAR SAID BULSTRODE INQUIRINGLY. PRAY BE SEATED.NO THANK YOU SAID LYDGATE WITH SOME HAUTEUR. I MENTIONED TO YOUYESTERDAY WHAT WAS THE STATE OF MY AFFAIRS. THERE IS NOTHING TO ADDEXCEPT THAT THE EXECUTION HAS SINCE THEN BEEN ACTUALLY PUT INTO MYHOUSE. ONE CAN TELL A GOOD DEAL OF TROUBLE IN A SHORT SENTENCE. I WILLSAY GOOD MORNING.STAY MR. LYDGATE STAY SAID BULSTRODE I HAVE BEEN RECONSIDERINGTHIS SUBJECT. I WAS YESTERDAY TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND SAW ITSUPERFICIALLY. MRS. BULSTRODE IS ANXIOUS FOR HER NIECE AND I MYSELFSHOULD GRIEVE AT A CALAMITOUS CHANGE IN YOUR POSITION. CLAIMS ON ME ARENUMEROUS BUT ON RECONSIDERATION I ESTEEM IT RIGHT THAT I SHOULD INCURA SMALL SACRIFICE RATHER THAN LEAVE YOU UNAIDED. YOU SAID I THINKTHAT A THOUSAND POUNDS WOULD SUFFICE ENTIRELY TO FREE YOU FROM YOURBURTHENS AND ENABLE YOU TO RECOVER A FIRM STANDYES SAID LYDGATE A GREAT LEAP OF JOY WITHIN HIM SURMOUNTING EVERYOTHER FEELING THAT WOULD PAY ALL MY DEBTS AND LEAVE ME A LITTLE ONHAND. I COULD SET ABOUT ECONOMIZING IN OUR WAY OF LIVING. AND BYANDBYMY PRACTICE MIGHT LOOK UP.IF YOU WILL WAIT A MOMENT MR. LYDGATE I WILL DRAW A CHECK TO THATAMOUNT. I AM AWARE THAT HELP TO BE EFFECTUAL IN THESE CASES SHOULD BETHOROUGH.WHILE BULSTRODE WROTE LYDGATE TURNED TO THE WINDOW THINKING OF HISHOMETHINKING OF HIS LIFE WITH ITS GOOD START SAVED FROM FRUSTRATIONITS GOOD PURPOSES STILL UNBROKEN.YOU CAN GIVE ME A NOTE OF HAND FOR THIS MR. LYDGATE SAID THEBANKER ADVANCING TOWARDS HIM WITH THE CHECK. AND BYANDBY I HOPEYOU MAY BE IN CIRCUMSTANCES GRADUALLY TO REPAY ME. MEANWHILE I HAVEPLEASURE IN THINKING THAT YOU WILL BE RELEASED FROM FURTHERDIFFICULTY.I AM DEEPLY OBLIGED TO YOU SAID LYDGATE. YOU HAVE RESTORED TO METHE PROSPECT OF WORKING WITH SOME HAPPINESS AND SOME CHANCE OF GOOD.IT APPEARED TO HIM A VERY NATURAL MOVEMENT IN BULSTRODE THAT HE SHOULDHAVE RECONSIDERED HIS REFUSAL IT CORRESPONDED WITH THE MORE MUNIFICENTSIDE OF HIS CHARACTER. BUT AS HE PUT HIS HACK INTO A CANTER THAT HEMIGHT GET THE SOONER HOME AND TELL THE GOOD NEWS TO ROSAMOND AND GETCASH AT THE BANK TO PAY OVER TO DOVERS AGENT THERE CROSSED HIS MINDWITH AN UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION AS FROM A DARKWINGED FLIGHT OF EVILAUGURY ACROSS HIS VISION THE THOUGHT OF THAT CONTRAST IN HIMSELF WHICHA FEW MONTHS HAD BROUGHTTHAT HE SHOULD BE OVERJOYED AT BEING UNDER ASTRONG PERSONAL OBLIGATIONTHAT HE SHOULD BE OVERJOYED AT GETTING MONEYFOR HIMSELF FROM BULSTRODE.THE BANKER FELT THAT HE HAD DONE SOMETHING TO NULLIFY ONE CAUSE OFUNEASINESS AND YET HE WAS SCARCELY THE EASIER. HE DID NOT MEASURE THEQUANTITY OF DISEASED MOTIVE WHICH HAD MADE HIM WISH FOR LYDGATESGOODWILL BUT THE QUANTITY WAS NONE THE LESS ACTIVELY THERE LIKE ANIRRITATING AGENT IN HIS BLOOD. A MAN VOWS AND YET WILL NOT CAST AWAYTHE MEANS OF BREAKING HIS VOW. IS IT THAT HE DISTINCTLY MEANS TO BREAKIT NOT AT ALL BUT THE DESIRES WHICH TEND TO BREAK IT ARE AT WORK INHIM DIMLY AND MAKE THEIR WAY INTO HIS IMAGINATION AND RELAX HISMUSCLES IN THE VERY MOMENTS WHEN HE IS TELLING HIMSELF OVER AGAIN THEREASONS FOR HIS VOW. RAFFLES RECOVERING QUICKLY RETURNING TO THE FREEUSE OF HIS ODIOUS POWERSHOW COULD BULSTRODE WISH FOR THAT RAFFLESDEAD WAS THE IMAGE THAT BROUGHT RELEASE AND INDIRECTLY HE PRAYED FORTHAT WAY OF RELEASE BESEECHING THAT IF IT WERE POSSIBLE THE REST OFHIS DAYS HERE BELOW MIGHT BE FREED FROM THE THREAT OF AN IGNOMINY WHICHWOULD BREAK HIM UTTERLY AS AN INSTRUMENT OF GODS SERVICE. LYDGATESOPINION WAS NOT ON THE SIDE OF PROMISE THAT THIS PRAYER WOULD BEFULFILLED AND AS THE DAY ADVANCED BULSTRODE FELT HIMSELF GETTINGIRRITATED AT THE PERSISTENT LIFE IN THIS MAN WHOM HE WOULD FAIN HAVESEEN SINKING INTO THE SILENCE OF DEATH IMPERIOUS WILL STIRREDMURDEROUS IMPULSES TOWARDS THIS BRUTE LIFE OVER WHICH WILL BY ITSELFHAD NO POWER. HE SAID INWARDLY THAT HE WAS GETTING TOO MUCH WORN HEWOULD NOT SIT UP WITH THE PATIENT TONIGHT BUT LEAVE HIM TO MRS. ABELWHO IF NECESSARY COULD CALL HER HUSBAND.AT SIX OCLOCK RAFFLES HAVING HAD ONLY FITFUL PERTURBED SNATCHES OFSLEEP FROM WHICH HE WAKED WITH FRESH RESTLESSNESS AND PERPETUAL CRIESTHAT HE WAS SINKING AWAY BULSTRODE BEGAN TO ADMINISTER THE OPIUMACCORDING TO LYDGATES DIRECTIONS. AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR OR MOREHE CALLED MRS. ABEL AND TOLD HER THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF UNFIT FORFURTHER WATCHING. HE MUST NOW CONSIGN THE PATIENT TO HER CARE AND HEPROCEEDED TO REPEAT TO HER LYDGATES DIRECTIONS AS TO THE QUANTITY OFEACH DOSE. MRS. ABEL HAD NOT BEFORE KNOWN ANYTHING OF LYDGATESPRESCRIPTIONS SHE HAD SIMPLY PREPARED AND BROUGHT WHATEVER BULSTRODEORDERED AND HAD DONE WHAT HE POINTED OUT TO HER. SHE BEGAN NOW TO ASKWHAT ELSE SHE SHOULD DO BESIDES ADMINISTERING THE OPIUM.NOTHING AT PRESENT EXCEPT THE OFFER OF THE SOUP OR THE SODAWATERYOU CAN COME TO ME FOR FURTHER DIRECTIONS. UNLESS THERE IS ANYIMPORTANT CHANGE I SHALL NOT COME INTO THE ROOM AGAIN TONIGHT. YOUWILL ASK YOUR HUSBAND FOR HELP IF NECESSARY. I MUST GO TO BED EARLY.YOUVE MUCH NEED SIR IM SURE SAID MRS. ABEL AND TO TAKESOMETHING MORE STRENGTHENING THAN WHAT YOUVE DONE.BULSTRODE WENT AWAY NOW WITHOUT ANXIETY AS TO WHAT RAFFLES MIGHT SAY INHIS RAVING WHICH HAD TAKEN ON A MUTTERING INCOHERENCE NOT LIKELY TOCREATE ANY DANGEROUS BELIEF. AT ANY RATE HE MUST RISK THIS. HE WENTDOWN INTO THE WAINSCOTED PARLOR FIRST AND BEGAN TO CONSIDER WHETHER HEWOULD NOT HAVE HIS HORSE SADDLED AND GO HOME BY THE MOONLIGHT AND GIVEUP CARING FOR EARTHLY CONSEQUENCES. THEN HE WISHED THAT HE HAD BEGGEDLYDGATE TO COME AGAIN THAT EVENING. PERHAPS HE MIGHT DELIVER ADIFFERENT OPINION AND THINK THAT RAFFLES WAS GETTING INTO A LESSHOPEFUL STATE. SHOULD HE SEND FOR LYDGATE IF RAFFLES WERE REALLYGETTING WORSE AND SLOWLY DYING BULSTRODE FELT THAT HE COULD GO TO BEDAND SLEEP IN GRATITUDE TO PROVIDENCE. BUT WAS HE WORSE LYDGATE MIGHTCOME AND SIMPLY SAY THAT HE WAS GOING ON AS HE EXPECTED AND PREDICTTHAT HE WOULD BYANDBY FALL INTO A GOOD SLEEP AND GET WELL. WHAT WASTHE USE OF SENDING FOR HIM BULSTRODE SHRANK FROM THAT RESULT. NO IDEASOR OPINIONS COULD HINDER HIM FROM SEEING THE ONE PROBABILITY TO BETHAT RAFFLES RECOVERED WOULD BE JUST THE SAME MAN AS BEFORE WITH HISSTRENGTH AS A TORMENTOR RENEWED OBLIGING HIM TO DRAG AWAY HIS WIFE TOSPEND HER YEARS APART FROM HER FRIENDS AND NATIVE PLACE CARRYING ANALIENATING SUSPICION AGAINST HIM IN HER HEART.HE HAD SAT AN HOUR AND A HALF IN THIS CONFLICT BY THE FIRELIGHT ONLYWHEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT MADE HIM RISE AND LIGHT THE BEDCANDLE WHICH HEHAD BROUGHT DOWN WITH HIM. THE THOUGHT WAS THAT HE HAD NOT TOLD MRS.ABEL WHEN THE DOSES OF OPIUM MUST CEASE.HE TOOK HOLD OF THE CANDLESTICK BUT STOOD MOTIONLESS FOR A LONG WHILE.SHE MIGHT ALREADY HAVE GIVEN HIM MORE THAN LYDGATE HAD PRESCRIBED. BUTIT WAS EXCUSABLE IN HIM THAT HE SHOULD FORGET PART OF AN ORDER IN HISPRESENT WEARIED CONDITION. HE WALKED UPSTAIRS CANDLE IN HAND NOTKNOWING WHETHER HE SHOULD STRAIGHTWAY ENTER HIS OWN ROOM AND GO TO BEDOR TURN TO THE PATIENTS ROOM AND RECTIFY HIS OMISSION. HE PAUSED INTHE PASSAGE WITH HIS FACE TURNED TOWARDS RAFFLESS ROOM AND HE COULDHEAR HIM MOANING AND MURMURING. HE WAS NOT ASLEEP THEN. WHO COULD KNOWTHAT LYDGATES PRESCRIPTION WOULD NOT BE BETTER DISOBEYED THANFOLLOWED SINCE THERE WAS STILL NO SLEEPHE TURNED INTO HIS OWN ROOM. BEFORE HE HAD QUITE UNDRESSED MRS. ABELRAPPED AT THE DOOR HE OPENED IT AN INCH SO THAT HE COULD HEAR HERSPEAK LOW.IF YOU PLEASE SIR SHOULD I HAVE NO BRANDY NOR NOTHING TO GIVE THEPOOR CREETUR HE FEELS SINKING AWAY AND NOTHING ELSE WILL HESWALLERAND BUT LITTLE STRENGTH IN IT IF HE DIDONLY THE OPIUM. AND HESAYS MORE AND MORE HES SINKING DOWN THROUGH THE EARTH.TO HER SURPRISE MR. BULSTRODE DID NOT ANSWER. A STRUGGLE WAS GOING ONWITHIN HIM.I THINK HE MUST DIE FOR WANT O SUPPORT IF HE GOES ON IN THAT WAY.WHEN I NURSED MY POOR MASTER MR. ROBISSON I HAD TO GIVE HIM PORTWINEAND BRANDY CONSTANT AND A BIG GLASS AT A TIME ADDED MRS. ABEL WITHA TOUCH OF REMONSTRANCE IN HER TONE.BUT AGAIN MR. BULSTRODE DID NOT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY AND SHE CONTINUEDITS NOT A TIME TO SPARE WHEN PEOPLE ARE AT DEATHS DOOR NOR WOULDYOU WISH IT SIR IM SURE. ELSE I SHOULD GIVE HIM OUR OWN BOTTLE ORUM AS WE KEEP BY US. BUT A SITTERUP SO AS YOUVE BEEN AND DOINGEVERYTHING AS LAID IN YOUR POWERHERE A KEY WAS THRUST THROUGH THE INCH OF DOORWAY AND MR. BULSTRODESAID HUSKILY THAT IS THE KEY OF THE WINECOOLER. YOU WILL FIND PLENTYOF BRANDY THERE.EARLY IN THE MORNINGABOUT SIXMR. BULSTRODE ROSE AND SPENT SOME TIMEIN PRAYER. DOES ANY ONE SUPPOSE THAT PRIVATE PRAYER IS NECESSARILYCANDIDNECESSARILY GOES TO THE ROOTS OF ACTION PRIVATE PRAYER ISINAUDIBLE SPEECH AND SPEECH IS REPRESENTATIVE WHO CAN REPRESENTHIMSELF JUST AS HE IS EVEN IN HIS OWN REFLECTIONS BULSTRODE HAD NOTYET UNRAVELLED IN HIS THOUGHT THE CONFUSED PROMPTINGS OF THE LASTFOURANDTWENTY HOURS.HE LISTENED IN THE PASSAGE AND COULD HEAR HARD STERTOROUS BREATHING.THEN HE WALKED OUT IN THE GARDEN AND LOOKED AT THE EARLY RIME ON THEGRASS AND FRESH SPRING LEAVES. WHEN HE REENTERED THE HOUSE HE FELTSTARTLED AT THE SIGHT OF MRS. ABEL.HOW IS YOUR PATIENTASLEEP I THINK HE SAID WITH AN ATTEMPT ATCHEERFULNESS IN HIS TONE.HES GONE VERY DEEP SIR SAID MRS. ABEL. HE WENT OFF GRADUALBETWEEN THREE AND FOUR OCLOCK. WOULD YOU PLEASE TO GO AND LOOK AT HIMI THOUGHT IT NO HARM TO LEAVE HIM. MY MANS GONE AFIELD AND THE LITTLEGIRLS SEEING TO THE KETTLES.BULSTRODE WENT UP. AT A GLANCE HE KNEW THAT RAFFLES WAS NOT IN THESLEEP WHICH BRINGS REVIVAL BUT IN THE SLEEP WHICH STREAMS DEEPER ANDDEEPER INTO THE GULF OF DEATH.HE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM AND SAW A BOTTLE WITH SOME BRANDY IN IT ANDTHE ALMOST EMPTY OPIUM PHIAL. HE PUT THE PHIAL OUT OF SIGHT ANDCARRIED THE BRANDYBOTTLE DOWNSTAIRS WITH HIM LOCKING IT AGAIN IN THEWINECOOLER.WHILE BREAKFASTING HE CONSIDERED WHETHER HE SHOULD RIDE TO MIDDLEMARCHAT ONCE OR WAIT FOR LYDGATES ARRIVAL. HE DECIDED TO WAIT AND TOLDMRS. ABEL THAT SHE MIGHT GO ABOUT HER WORKHE COULD WATCH IN THEBEDCHAMBER.AS HE SAT THERE AND BEHELD THE ENEMY OF HIS PEACE GOING IRREVOCABLYINTO SILENCE HE FELT MORE AT REST THAN HE HAD DONE FOR MANY MONTHS.HIS CONSCIENCE WAS SOOTHED BY THE ENFOLDING WING OF SECRECY WHICHSEEMED JUST THEN LIKE AN ANGEL SENT DOWN FOR HIS RELIEF. HE DREW OUTHIS POCKETBOOK TO REVIEW VARIOUS MEMORANDA THERE AS TO THEARRANGEMENTS HE HAD PROJECTED AND PARTLY CARRIED OUT IN THE PROSPECT OFQUITTING MIDDLEMARCH AND CONSIDERED HOW FAR HE WOULD LET THEM STAND ORRECALL THEM NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE WOULD BE BRIEF. SOME ECONOMIES WHICHHE FELT DESIRABLE MIGHT STILL FIND A SUITABLE OCCASION IN HIS TEMPORARYWITHDRAWAL FROM MANAGEMENT AND HE HOPED STILL THAT MRS. CASAUBON WOULDTAKE A LARGE SHARE IN THE EXPENSES OF THE HOSPITAL. IN THAT WAY THEMOMENTS PASSED UNTIL A CHANGE IN THE STERTOROUS BREATHING WAS MARKEDENOUGH TO DRAW HIS ATTENTION WHOLLY TO THE BED AND FORCED HIM TO THINKOF THE DEPARTING LIFE WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN SUBSERVIENT TO HIS OWNWHICHHE HAD ONCE BEEN GLAD TO FIND BASE ENOUGH FOR HIM TO ACT ON AS HEWOULD. IT WAS HIS GLADNESS THEN WHICH IMPELLED HIM NOW TO BE GLAD THATTHE LIFE WAS AT AN END.AND WHO COULD SAY THAT THE DEATH OF RAFFLES HAD BEEN HASTENED WHO KNEWWHAT WOULD HAVE SAVED HIMLYDGATE ARRIVED AT HALFPAST TEN IN TIME TO WITNESS THE FINAL PAUSE OFTHE BREATH. WHEN HE ENTERED THE ROOM BULSTRODE OBSERVED A SUDDENEXPRESSION IN HIS FACE WHICH WAS NOT SO MUCH SURPRISE AS A RECOGNITIONTHAT HE HAD NOT JUDGED CORRECTLY. HE STOOD BY THE BED IN SILENCE FORSOME TIME WITH HIS EYES TURNED ON THE DYING MAN BUT WITH THAT SUBDUEDACTIVITY OF EXPRESSION WHICH SHOWED THAT HE WAS CARRYING ON AN INWARDDEBATE.WHEN DID THIS CHANGE BEGIN SAID HE LOOKING AT BULSTRODE.I DID NOT WATCH BY HIM LAST NIGHT SAID BULSTRODE. I WAS OVERWORNAND LEFT HIM UNDER MRS. ABELS CARE. SHE SAID THAT HE SANK INTO SLEEPBETWEEN THREE AND FOUR OCLOCK. WHEN I CAME IN BEFORE EIGHT HE WASNEARLY IN THIS CONDITION.LYDGATE DID NOT ASK ANOTHER QUESTION BUT WATCHED IN SILENCE UNTIL HESAID ITS ALL OVER.THIS MORNING LYDGATE WAS IN A STATE OF RECOVERED HOPE AND FREEDOM. HEHAD SET OUT ON HIS WORK WITH ALL HIS OLD ANIMATION AND FELT HIMSELFSTRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR ALL THE DEFICIENCIES OF HIS MARRIED LIFE. AND HEWAS CONSCIOUS THAT BULSTRODE HAD BEEN A BENEFACTOR TO HIM. BUT HE WASUNEASY ABOUT THIS CASE. HE HAD NOT EXPECTED IT TO TERMINATE AS IT HADDONE. YET HE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO PUT A QUESTION ON THE SUBJECT TOBULSTRODE WITHOUT APPEARING TO INSULT HIM AND IF HE EXAMINED THEHOUSEKEEPERWHY THE MAN WAS DEAD. THERE SEEMED TO BE NO USE INIMPLYING THAT SOMEBODYS IGNORANCE OR IMPRUDENCE HAD KILLED HIM. ANDAFTER ALL HE HIMSELF MIGHT BE WRONG.HE AND BULSTRODE RODE BACK TO MIDDLEMARCH TOGETHER TALKING OF MANYTHINGSCHIEFLY CHOLERA AND THE CHANCES OF THE REFORM BILL IN THE HOUSEOF LORDS AND THE FIRM RESOLVE OF THE POLITICAL UNIONS. NOTHING WASSAID ABOUT RAFFLES EXCEPT THAT BULSTRODE MENTIONED THE NECESSITY OFHAVING A GRAVE FOR HIM IN LOWICK CHURCHYARD AND OBSERVED THAT SO FARAS HE KNEW THE POOR MAN HAD NO CONNECTIONS EXCEPT RIGG WHOM HE HADSTATED TO BE UNFRIENDLY TOWARDS HIM.ON RETURNING HOME LYDGATE HAD A VISIT FROM MR. FAREBROTHER. THE VICARHAD NOT BEEN IN THE TOWN THE DAY BEFORE BUT THE NEWS THAT THERE WAS ANEXECUTION IN LYDGATES HOUSE HAD GOT TO LOWICK BY THE EVENING HAVINGBEEN CARRIED BY MR. SPICER SHOEMAKER AND PARISHCLERK WHO HAD IT FROMHIS BROTHER THE RESPECTABLE BELLHANGER IN LOWICK GATE. SINCE THATEVENING WHEN LYDGATE HAD COME DOWN FROM THE BILLIARD ROOM WITH FREDVINCY MR. FAREBROTHERS THOUGHTS ABOUT HIM HAD BEEN RATHER GLOOMY.PLAYING AT THE GREEN DRAGON ONCE OR OFTENER MIGHT HAVE BEEN A TRIFLE INANOTHER MAN BUT IN LYDGATE IT WAS ONE OF SEVERAL SIGNS THAT HE WASGETTING UNLIKE HIS FORMER SELF. HE WAS BEGINNING TO DO THINGS FOR WHICHHE HAD FORMERLY EVEN AN EXCESSIVE SCORN. WHATEVER CERTAINDISSATISFACTIONS IN MARRIAGE WHICH SOME SILLY TINKLINGS OF GOSSIP HADGIVEN HIM HINTS OF MIGHT HAVE TO DO WITH THIS CHANGE MR. FAREBROTHERFELT SURE THAT IT WAS CHIEFLY CONNECTED WITH THE DEBTS WHICH WERE BEINGMORE AND MORE DISTINCTLY REPORTED AND HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT ANY NOTIONOF LYDGATES HAVING RESOURCES OR FRIENDS IN THE BACKGROUND MUST BEQUITE ILLUSORY. THE REBUFF HE HAD MET WITH IN HIS FIRST ATTEMPT TO WINLYDGATES CONFIDENCE DISINCLINED HIM TO A SECOND BUT THIS NEWS OF THEEXECUTION BEING ACTUALLY IN THE HOUSE DETERMINED THE VICAR TO OVERCOMEHIS RELUCTANCE.LYDGATE HAD JUST DISMISSED A POOR PATIENT IN WHOM HE WAS MUCHINTERESTED AND HE CAME FORWARD TO PUT OUT HIS HANDWITH AN OPENCHEERFULNESS WHICH SURPRISED MR. FAREBROTHER. COULD THIS TOO BE A PROUDREJECTION OF SYMPATHY AND HELP NEVER MIND THE SYMPATHY AND HELPSHOULD BE OFFERED.HOW ARE YOU LYDGATE I CAME TO SEE YOU BECAUSE I HAD HEARD SOMETHINGWHICH MADE ME ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU SAID THE VICAR IN THE TONE OF A GOODBROTHER ONLY THAT THERE WAS NO REPROACH IN IT. THEY WERE BOTH SEATEDBY THIS TIME AND LYDGATE ANSWERED IMMEDIATELYI THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. YOU HAD HEARD THAT THERE WAS ANEXECUTION IN THE HOUSEYES IS IT TRUEIT WAS TRUE SAID LYDGATE WITH AN AIR OF FREEDOM AS IF HE DID NOTMIND TALKING ABOUT THE AFFAIR NOW. BUT THE DANGER IS OVER THE DEBT ISPAID. I AM OUT OF MY DIFFICULTIES NOW I SHALL BE FREED FROM DEBTS ANDABLE I HOPE TO START AFRESH ON A BETTER PLAN.I AM VERY THANKFUL TO HEAR IT SAID THE VICAR FALLING BACK IN HISCHAIR AND SPEAKING WITH THAT LOWTONED QUICKNESS WHICH OFTEN FOLLOWSTHE REMOVAL OF A LOAD. I LIKE THAT BETTER THAN ALL THE NEWS IN THETIMES. I CONFESS I CAME TO YOU WITH A HEAVY HEART.THANK YOU FOR COMING SAID LYDGATE CORDIALLY. I CAN ENJOY THEKINDNESS ALL THE MORE BECAUSE I AM HAPPIER. I HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN AGOOD DEAL CRUSHED. IM AFRAID I SHALL FIND THE BRUISES STILL PAINFULBYAND BY HE ADDED SMILING RATHER SADLY BUT JUST NOW I CAN ONLYFEEL THAT THE TORTURESCREW IS OFF.MR. FAREBROTHER WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID EARNESTLY MYDEAR FELLOW LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION. FORGIVE ME IF I TAKE ALIBERTY.I DONT BELIEVE YOU WILL ASK ANYTHING THAT OUGHT TO OFFEND ME.THENTHIS IS NECESSARY TO SET MY HEART QUITE AT RESTYOU HAVE NOTHAVEYOUIN ORDER TO PAY YOUR DEBTS INCURRED ANOTHER DEBT WHICH MAY HARASSYOU WORSE HEREAFTERNO SAID LYDGATE COLORING SLIGHTLY. THERE IS NO REASON WHY I SHOULDNOT TELL YOUSINCE THE FACT IS SOTHAT THE PERSON TO WHOM I AM INDEBTEDIS BULSTRODE. HE HAS MADE ME A VERY HANDSOME ADVANCEA THOUSANDPOUNDSAND HE CAN AFFORD TO WAIT FOR REPAYMENT.WELL THAT IS GENEROUS SAID MR. FAREBROTHER COMPELLING HIMSELF TOAPPROVE OF THE MAN WHOM HE DISLIKED. HIS DELICATE FEELING SHRANK FROMDWELLING EVEN IN HIS THOUGHT ON THE FACT THAT HE HAD ALWAYS URGEDLYDGATE TO AVOID ANY PERSONAL ENTANGLEMENT WITH BULSTRODE. HE ADDEDIMMEDIATELY AND BULSTRODE MUST NATURALLY FEEL AN INTEREST IN YOURWELFARE AFTER YOU HAVE WORKED WITH HIM IN A WAY WHICH HAS PROBABLYREDUCED YOUR INCOME INSTEAD OF ADDING TO IT. I AM GLAD TO THINK THAT HEHAS ACTED ACCORDINGLY.LYDGATE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE UNDER THESE KINDLY SUPPOSITIONS. THEY MADEMORE DISTINCT WITHIN HIM THE UNEASY CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH HAD SHOWN ITSFIRST DIM STIRRINGS ONLY A FEW HOURS BEFORE THAT BULSTRODES MOTIVESFOR HIS SUDDEN BENEFICENCE FOLLOWING CLOSE UPON THE CHILLESTINDIFFERENCE MIGHT BE MERELY SELFISH. HE LET THE KINDLY SUPPOSITIONSPASS. HE COULD NOT TELL THE HISTORY OF THE LOAN BUT IT WAS MOREVIVIDLY PRESENT WITH HIM THAN EVER AS WELL AS THE FACT WHICH THE VICARDELICATELY IGNOREDTHAT THIS RELATION OF PERSONAL INDEBTEDNESS TOBULSTRODE WAS WHAT HE HAD ONCE BEEN MOST RESOLVED TO AVOID.HE BEGAN INSTEAD OF ANSWERING TO SPEAK OF HIS PROJECTED ECONOMIESAND OF HIS HAVING COME TO LOOK AT HIS LIFE FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OFVIEW.I SHALL SET UP A SURGERY HE SAID. I REALLY THINK I MADE A MISTAKENEFFORT IN THAT RESPECT. AND IF ROSAMOND WILL NOT MIND I SHALL TAKE ANAPPRENTICE. I DONT LIKE THESE THINGS BUT IF ONE CARRIES THEM OUTFAITHFULLY THEY ARE NOT REALLY LOWERING. I HAVE HAD A SEVERE GALLING TOBEGIN WITH THAT WILL MAKE THE SMALL RUBS SEEM EASY.POOR LYDGATE THE IF ROSAMOND WILL NOT MIND WHICH HAD FALLEN FROMHIM INVOLUNTARILY AS PART OF HIS THOUGHT WAS A SIGNIFICANT MARK OF THEYOKE HE BORE. BUT MR. FAREBROTHER WHOSE HOPES ENTERED STRONGLY INTOTHE SAME CURRENT WITH LYDGATES AND WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HIM THATCOULD NOW RAISE A MELANCHOLY PRESENTIMENT LEFT HIM WITH AFFECTIONATECONGRATULATION.CHAPTER LXXI.CLOWN. . . . TWAS IN THE BUNCH OF GRAPES WHERE INDEEDYOU HAVE A DELIGHT TO SIT HAVE YOU NOTFROTH. I HAVE SO BECAUSE IT IS AN OPEN ROOM AND GOOD FOR WINTER.CLO. WHY VERY WELL THEN I HOPE HERE BE TRUTHS.MEASURE FOR MEASURE.FIVE DAYS AFTER THE DEATH OF RAFFLES MR. BAMBRIDGE WAS STANDING AT HISLEISURE UNDER THE LARGE ARCHWAY LEADING INTO THE YARD OF THE GREENDRAGON. HE WAS NOT FOND OF SOLITARY CONTEMPLATION BUT HE HAD ONLY JUSTCOME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND ANY HUMAN FIGURE STANDING AT EASE UNDER THEARCHWAY IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON WAS AS CERTAIN TO ATTRACT COMPANIONSHIPAS A PIGEON WHICH HAS FOUND SOMETHING WORTH PECKING AT. IN THIS CASETHERE WAS NO MATERIAL OBJECT TO FEED UPON BUT THE EYE OF REASON SAW APROBABILITY OF MENTAL SUSTENANCE IN THE SHAPE OF GOSSIP. MR. HOPKINSTHE MEEKMANNERED DRAPER OPPOSITE WAS THE FIRST TO ACT ON THIS INWARDVISION BEING THE MORE AMBITIOUS OF A LITTLE MASCULINE TALK BECAUSE HISCUSTOMERS WERE CHIEFLY WOMEN. MR. BAMBRIDGE WAS RATHER CURT TO THEDRAPER FEELING THAT HOPKINS WAS OF COURSE GLAD TO TALK TO HIM BUTTHAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO WASTE MUCH OF HIS TALK ON HOPKINS. SOONHOWEVER THERE WAS A SMALL CLUSTER OF MORE IMPORTANT LISTENERS WHOWERE EITHER DEPOSITED FROM THE PASSERSBY OR HAD SAUNTERED TO THE SPOTEXPRESSLY TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANYTHING GOING ON AT THE GREEN DRAGONAND MR. BAMBRIDGE WAS FINDING IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO SAY MANY IMPRESSIVETHINGS ABOUT THE FINE STUDS HE HAD BEEN SEEING AND THE PURCHASES HE HADMADE ON A JOURNEY IN THE NORTH FROM WHICH HE HAD JUST RETURNED.GENTLEMEN PRESENT WERE ASSURED THAT WHEN THEY COULD SHOW HIM ANYTHINGTO CUT OUT A BLOOD MARE A BAY RISING FOUR WHICH WAS TO BE SEEN ATDONCASTER IF THEY CHOSE TO GO AND LOOK AT IT MR. BAMBRIDGE WOULDGRATIFY THEM BY BEING SHOT FROM HERE TO HEREFORD. ALSO A PAIR OFBLACKS WHICH HE WAS GOING TO PUT INTO THE BREAK RECALLED VIVIDLY TO HISMIND A PAIR WHICH HE HAD SOLD TO FAULKNER IN  FOR A HUNDREDGUINEAS AND WHICH FAULKNER HAD SOLD FOR A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MONTHSLATERANY GENT WHO COULD DISPROVE THIS STATEMENT BEING OFFERED THEPRIVILEGE OF CALLING MR. BAMBRIDGE BY A VERY UGLY NAME UNTIL THEEXERCISE MADE HIS THROAT DRY.WHEN THE DISCOURSE WAS AT THIS POINT OF ANIMATION CAME UP MR. FRANKHAWLEY. HE WAS NOT A MAN TO COMPROMISE HIS DIGNITY BY LOUNGING AT THEGREEN DRAGON BUT HAPPENING TO PASS ALONG THE HIGH STREET AND SEEINGBAMBRIDGE ON THE OTHER SIDE HE TOOK SOME OF HIS LONG STRIDES ACROSS TOASK THE HORSEDEALER WHETHER HE HAD FOUND THE FIRSTRATE GIGHORSE WHICHHE HAD ENGAGED TO LOOK FOR. MR. HAWLEY WAS REQUESTED TO WAIT UNTIL HEHAD SEEN A GRAY SELECTED AT BILKLEY IF THAT DID NOT MEET HIS WISHES TOA HAIR BAMBRIDGE DID NOT KNOW A HORSE WHEN HE SAW IT WHICH SEEMED TOBE THE HIGHEST CONCEIVABLE UNLIKELIHOOD. MR. HAWLEY STANDING WITH HISBACK TO THE STREET WAS FIXING A TIME FOR LOOKING AT THE GRAY ANDSEEING IT TRIED WHEN A HORSEMAN PASSED SLOWLY BY.BULSTRODE SAID TWO OR THREE VOICES AT ONCE IN A LOW TONE ONE OFTHEM WHICH WAS THE DRAPERS RESPECTFULLY PREFIXING THE MR. BUTNOBODY HAVING MORE INTENTION IN THIS INTERJECTURAL NAMING THAN IF THEYHAD SAID THE RIVERSTON COACH WHEN THAT VEHICLE APPEARED IN THEDISTANCE. MR. HAWLEY GAVE A CARELESS GLANCE ROUND AT BULSTRODES BACKBUT AS BAMBRIDGES EYES FOLLOWED IT HE MADE A SARCASTIC GRIMACE.BY JINGO THAT REMINDS ME HE BEGAN LOWERING HIS VOICE A LITTLE IPICKED UP SOMETHING ELSE AT BILKLEY BESIDES YOUR GIGHORSE MR. HAWLEY.I PICKED UP A FINE STORY ABOUT BULSTRODE. DO YOU KNOW HOW HE CAME BYHIS FORTUNE ANY GENTLEMAN WANTING A BIT OF CURIOUS INFORMATION I CANGIVE IT HIM FREE OF EXPENSE. IF EVERYBODY GOT THEIR DESERTS BULSTRODEMIGHT HAVE HAD TO SAY HIS PRAYERS AT BOTANY BAY.WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID MR. HAWLEY THRUSTING HIS HANDS INTO HISPOCKETS AND PUSHING A LITTLE FORWARD UNDER THE ARCHWAY. IF BULSTRODESHOULD TURN OUT TO BE A RASCAL FRANK HAWLEY HAD A PROPHETIC SOUL.I HAD IT FROM A PARTY WHO WAS AN OLD CHUM OF BULSTRODES. ILL TELLYOU WHERE I FIRST PICKED HIM UP SAID BAMBRIDGE WITH A SUDDEN GESTUREOF HIS FOREFINGER. HE WAS AT LARCHERS SALE BUT I KNEW NOTHING OFHIM THENHE SLIPPED THROUGH MY FINGERSWAS AFTER BULSTRODE NO DOUBT.HE TELLS ME HE CAN TAP BULSTRODE TO ANY AMOUNT KNOWS ALL HIS SECRETS.HOWEVER HE BLABBED TO ME AT BILKLEY HE TAKES A STIFF GLASS. DAMME IFI THINK HE MEANT TO TURN KINGS EVIDENCE BUT HES THAT SORT OFBRAGGING FELLOW THE BRAGGING RUNS OVER HEDGE AND DITCH WITH HIM TILLHED BRAG OF A SPAVIN AS IF IT UD FETCH MONEY. A MAN SHOULD KNOW WHENTO PULL UP. MR. BAMBRIDGE MADE THIS REMARK WITH AN AIR OF DISGUSTSATISFIED THAT HIS OWN BRAGGING SHOWED A FINE SENSE OF THE MARKETABLE.WHATS THE MANS NAME WHERE CAN HE BE FOUND SAID MR. HAWLEY.AS TO WHERE HE IS TO BE FOUND I LEFT HIM TO IT AT THE SARACENS HEADBUT HIS NAME IS RAFFLES.RAFFLES EXCLAIMED MR. HOPKINS. I FURNISHED HIS FUNERAL YESTERDAY.HE WAS BURIED AT LOWICK. MR. BULSTRODE FOLLOWED HIM. A VERY DECENTFUNERAL. THERE WAS A STRONG SENSATION AMONG THE LISTENERS. MR.BAMBRIDGE GAVE AN EJACULATION IN WHICH BRIMSTONE WAS THE MILDESTWORD AND MR. HAWLEY KNITTING HIS BROWS AND BENDING HIS HEAD FORWARDEXCLAIMED WHATWHERE DID THE MAN DIEAT STONE COURT SAID THE DRAPER. THE HOUSEKEEPER SAID HE WAS ARELATION OF THE MASTERS. HE CAME THERE ILL ON FRIDAY.WHY IT WAS ON WEDNESDAY I TOOK A GLASS WITH HIM INTERPOSEDBAMBRIDGE.DID ANY DOCTOR ATTEND HIM SAID MR. HAWLEYYES. MR. LYDGATE. MR. BULSTRODE SAT UP WITH HIM ONE NIGHT. HE DIED THETHIRD MORNING.GO ON BAMBRIDGE SAID MR. HAWLEY INSISTENTLY. WHAT DID THIS FELLOWSAY ABOUT BULSTRODETHE GROUP HAD ALREADY BECOME LARGER THE TOWNCLERKS PRESENCE BEING AGUARANTEE THAT SOMETHING WORTH LISTENING TO WAS GOING ON THERE AND MR.BAMBRIDGE DELIVERED HIS NARRATIVE IN THE HEARING OF SEVEN. IT WASMAINLY WHAT WE KNOW INCLUDING THE FACT ABOUT WILL LADISLAW WITH SOMELOCAL COLOR AND CIRCUMSTANCE ADDED IT WAS WHAT BULSTRODE HAD DREADEDTHE BETRAYAL OFAND HOPED TO HAVE BURIED FOREVER WITH THE CORPSE OFRAFFLESIT WAS THAT HAUNTING GHOST OF HIS EARLIER LIFE WHICH AS HE RODEPAST THE ARCHWAY OF THE GREEN DRAGON HE WAS TRUSTING THAT PROVIDENCEHAD DELIVERED HIM FROM. YES PROVIDENCE. HE HAD NOT CONFESSED TOHIMSELF YET THAT HE HAD DONE ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF CONTRIVANCE TO THISEND HE HAD ACCEPTED WHAT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN OFFERED. IT WASIMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE THAT HE HAD DONE ANYTHING WHICH HASTENED THEDEPARTURE OF THAT MANS SOUL.BUT THIS GOSSIP ABOUT BULSTRODE SPREAD THROUGH MIDDLEMARCH LIKE THESMELL OF FIRE. MR. FRANK HAWLEY FOLLOWED UP HIS INFORMATION BY SENDINGA CLERK WHOM HE COULD TRUST TO STONE COURT ON A PRETEXT OF INQUIRINGABOUT HAY BUT REALLY TO GATHER ALL THAT COULD BE LEARNED ABOUT RAFFLESAND HIS ILLNESS FROM MRS. ABEL. IN THIS WAY IT CAME TO HIS KNOWLEDGETHAT MR. GARTH HAD CARRIED THE MAN TO STONE COURT IN HIS GIG AND MR.HAWLEY IN CONSEQUENCE TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING CALEB CALLING ATHIS OFFICE TO ASK WHETHER HE HAD TIME TO UNDERTAKE AN ARBITRATION IF ITWERE REQUIRED AND THEN ASKING HIM INCIDENTALLY ABOUT RAFFLES. CALEBWAS BETRAYED INTO NO WORD INJURIOUS TO BULSTRODE BEYOND THE FACT WHICHHE WAS FORCED TO ADMIT THAT HE HAD GIVEN UP ACTING FOR HIM WITHIN THELAST WEEK. MR HAWLEY DREW HIS INFERENCES AND FEELING CONVINCED THATRAFFLES HAD TOLD HIS STORY TO GARTH AND THAT GARTH HAD GIVEN UPBULSTRODES AFFAIRS IN CONSEQUENCE SAID SO A FEW HOURS LATER TO MR.TOLLER. THE STATEMENT WAS PASSED ON UNTIL IT HAD QUITE LOST THE STAMPOF AN INFERENCE AND WAS TAKEN AS INFORMATION COMING STRAIGHT FROMGARTH SO THAT EVEN A DILIGENT HISTORIAN MIGHT HAVE CONCLUDED CALEB TOBE THE CHIEF PUBLISHER OF BULSTRODES MISDEMEANORS.MR. HAWLEY WAS NOT SLOW TO PERCEIVE THAT THERE WAS NO HANDLE FOR THELAW EITHER IN THE REVELATIONS MADE BY RAFFLES OR IN THE CIRCUMSTANCESOF HIS DEATH. HE HAD HIMSELF RIDDEN TO LOWICK VILLAGE THAT HE MIGHTLOOK AT THE REGISTER AND TALK OVER THE WHOLE MATTER WITH MR.FAREBROTHER WHO WAS NOT MORE SURPRISED THAN THE LAWYER THAT AN UGLYSECRET SHOULD HAVE COME TO LIGHT ABOUT BULSTRODE THOUGH HE HAD ALWAYSHAD JUSTICE ENOUGH IN HIM TO HINDER HIS ANTIPATHY FROM TURNING INTOCONCLUSIONS. BUT WHILE THEY WERE TALKING ANOTHER COMBINATION WASSILENTLY GOING FORWARD IN MR. FAREBROTHERS MIND WHICH FORESHADOWEDWHAT WAS SOON TO BE LOUDLY SPOKEN OF IN MIDDLEMARCH AS A NECESSARYPUTTING OF TWO AND TWO TOGETHER. WITH THE REASONS WHICH KEPTBULSTRODE IN DREAD OF RAFFLES THERE FLASHED THE THOUGHT THAT THE DREADMIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH HIS MUNIFICENCE TOWARDS HIS MEDICALMAN AND THOUGH HE RESISTED THE SUGGESTION THAT IT HAD BEEN CONSCIOUSLYACCEPTED IN ANY WAY AS A BRIBE HE HAD A FOREBODING THAT THISCOMPLICATION OF THINGS MIGHT BE OF MALIGNANT EFFECT ON LYDGATESREPUTATION. HE PERCEIVED THAT MR. HAWLEY KNEW NOTHING AT PRESENT OF THESUDDEN RELIEF FROM DEBT AND HE HIMSELF WAS CAREFUL TO GLIDE AWAY FROMALL APPROACHES TOWARDS THE SUBJECT.WELL HE SAID WITH A DEEP BREATH WANTING TO WIND UP THE ILLIMITABLEDISCUSSION OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THOUGH NOTHING COULD BE LEGALLYPROVEN IT IS A STRANGE STORY. SO OUR MERCURIAL LADISLAW HAS A QUEERGENEALOGY A HIGHSPIRITED YOUNG LADY AND A MUSICAL POLISH PATRIOT MADEA LIKELY ENOUGH STOCK FOR HIM TO SPRING FROM BUT I SHOULD NEVER HAVESUSPECTED A GRAFTING OF THE JEW PAWNBROKER. HOWEVER THERES NO KNOWINGWHAT A MIXTURE WILL TURN OUT BEFOREHAND. SOME SORTS OF DIRT SERVE TOCLARIFY.ITS JUST WHAT I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED SAID MR. HAWLEY MOUNTING HISHORSE. ANY CURSED ALIEN BLOOD JEW CORSICAN OR GYPSY.I KNOW HES ONE OF YOUR BLACK SHEEP HAWLEY. BUT HE IS REALLY ADISINTERESTED UNWORLDLY FELLOW SAID MR. FAREBROTHER SMILING.AY AY THAT IS YOUR WHIGGISH TWIST SAID MR. HAWLEY WHO HAD BEEN INTHE HABIT OF SAYING APOLOGETICALLY THAT FAREBROTHER WAS SUCH A DAMNEDPLEASANT GOODHEARTED FELLOW YOU WOULD MISTAKE HIM FOR A TORY.MR. HAWLEY RODE HOME WITHOUT THINKING OF LYDGATES ATTENDANCE ONRAFFLES IN ANY OTHER LIGHT THAN AS A PIECE OF EVIDENCE ON THE SIDE OFBULSTRODE. BUT THE NEWS THAT LYDGATE HAD ALL AT ONCE BECOME ABLE NOTONLY TO GET RID OF THE EXECUTION IN HIS HOUSE BUT TO PAY ALL HIS DEBTSIN MIDDLEMARCH WAS SPREADING FAST GATHERING ROUND IT CONJECTURES ANDCOMMENTS WHICH GAVE IT NEW BODY AND IMPETUS AND SOON FILLING THE EARSOF OTHER PERSONS BESIDES MR. HAWLEY WHO WERE NOT SLOW TO SEE ASIGNIFICANT RELATION BETWEEN THIS SUDDEN COMMAND OF MONEY ANDBULSTRODES DESIRE TO STIFLE THE SCANDAL OF RAFFLES. THAT THE MONEYCAME FROM BULSTRODE WOULD INFALLIBLY HAVE BEEN GUESSED EVEN IF THEREHAD BEEN NO DIRECT EVIDENCE OF IT FOR IT HAD BEFOREHAND ENTERED INTOTHE GOSSIP ABOUT LYDGATES AFFAIRS THAT NEITHER HIS FATHERINLAW NORHIS OWN FAMILY WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR HIM AND DIRECT EVIDENCE WASFURNISHED NOT ONLY BY A CLERK AT THE BANK BUT BY INNOCENT MRS.BULSTRODE HERSELF WHO MENTIONED THE LOAN TO MRS. PLYMDALE WHOMENTIONED IT TO HER DAUGHTERINLAW OF THE HOUSE OF TOLLER WHOMENTIONED IT GENERALLY. THE BUSINESS WAS FELT TO BE SO PUBLIC ANDIMPORTANT THAT IT REQUIRED DINNERS TO FEED IT AND MANY INVITATIONSWERE JUST THEN ISSUED AND ACCEPTED ON THE STRENGTH OF THIS SCANDALCONCERNING BULSTRODE AND LYDGATE WIVES WIDOWS AND SINGLE LADIES TOOKTHEIR WORK AND WENT OUT TO TEA OFTENER THAN USUAL AND ALL PUBLICCONVIVIALITY FROM THE GREEN DRAGON TO DOLLOPS GATHERED A ZEST WHICHCOULD NOT BE WON FROM THE QUESTION WHETHER THE LORDS WOULD THROW OUTTHE REFORM BILL.FOR HARDLY ANYBODY DOUBTED THAT SOME SCANDALOUS REASON OR OTHER WAS ATTHE BOTTOM OF BULSTRODES LIBERALITY TO LYDGATE. MR. HAWLEY INDEED INTHE FIRST INSTANCE INVITED A SELECT PARTY INCLUDING THE TWOPHYSICIANS WITH MR TOLLER AND MR. WRENCH EXPRESSLY TO HOLD A CLOSEDISCUSSION AS TO THE PROBABILITIES OF RAFFLESS ILLNESS RECITING TOTHEM ALL THE PARTICULARS WHICH HAD BEEN GATHERED FROM MRS. ABEL INCONNECTION WITH LYDGATES CERTIFICATE THAT THE DEATH WAS DUE TODELIRIUM TREMENS AND THE MEDICAL GENTLEMEN WHO ALL STOODUNDISTURBEDLY ON THE OLD PATHS IN RELATION TO THIS DISEASE DECLAREDTHAT THEY COULD SEE NOTHING IN THESE PARTICULARS WHICH COULD BETRANSFORMED INTO A POSITIVE GROUND OF SUSPICION. BUT THE MORAL GROUNDSOF SUSPICION REMAINED THE STRONG MOTIVES BULSTRODE CLEARLY HAD FORWISHING TO BE RID OF RAFFLES AND THE FACT THAT AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENTHE HAD GIVEN LYDGATE THE HELP WHICH HE MUST FOR SOME TIME HAVE KNOWNTHE NEED FOR THE DISPOSITION MOREOVER TO BELIEVE THAT BULSTRODEWOULD BE UNSCRUPULOUS AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY INDISPOSITION TO BELIEVETHAT LYDGATE MIGHT BE AS EASILY BRIBED AS OTHER HAUGHTYMINDED MEN WHENTHEY HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES IN WANT OF MONEY. EVEN IF THE MONEY HAD BEENGIVEN MERELY TO MAKE HIM HOLD HIS TONGUE ABOUT THE SCANDAL OFBULSTRODES EARLIER LIFE THE FACT THREW AN ODIOUS LIGHT ON LYDGATEWHO HAD LONG BEEN SNEERED AT AS MAKING HIMSELF SUBSERVIENT TO THEBANKER FOR THE SAKE OF WORKING HIMSELF INTO PREDOMINANCE ANDDISCREDITING THE ELDER MEMBERS OF HIS PROFESSION. HENCE IN SPITE OFTHE NEGATIVE AS TO ANY DIRECT SIGN OF GUILT IN RELATION TO THE DEATH ATSTONE COURT MR. HAWLEYS SELECT PARTY BROKE UP WITH THE SENSE THAT THEAFFAIR HAD AN UGLY LOOK.BUT THIS VAGUE CONVICTION OF INDETERMINABLE GUILT WHICH WAS ENOUGH TOKEEP UP MUCH HEADSHAKING AND BITING INNUENDO EVEN AMONG SUBSTANTIALPROFESSIONAL SENIORS HAD FOR THE GENERAL MIND ALL THE SUPERIOR POWEROF MYSTERY OVER FACT. EVERYBODY LIKED BETTER TO CONJECTURE HOW THETHING WAS THAN SIMPLY TO KNOW IT FOR CONJECTURE SOON BECAME MORECONFIDENT THAN KNOWLEDGE AND HAD A MORE LIBERAL ALLOWANCE FOR THEINCOMPATIBLE. EVEN THE MORE DEFINITE SCANDAL CONCERNING BULSTRODESEARLIER LIFE WAS FOR SOME MINDS MELTED INTO THE MASS OF MYSTERY ASSO MUCH LIVELY METAL TO BE POURED OUT IN DIALOGUE AND TO TAKE SUCHFANTASTIC SHAPES AS HEAVEN PLEASED.THIS WAS THE TONE OF THOUGHT CHIEFLY SANCTIONED BY MRS. DOLLOP THESPIRITED LANDLADY OF THE TANKARD IN SLAUGHTER LANE WHO HAD OFTEN TORESIST THE SHALLOW PRAGMATISM OF CUSTOMERS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT THEIRREPORTS FROM THE OUTER WORLD WERE OF EQUAL FORCE WITH WHAT HAD COMEUP IN HER MIND. HOW IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO HER SHE DIDNT KNOW BUT ITWAS THERE BEFORE HER AS IF IT HAD BEEN SCORED WITH THE CHALK ON THECHIMNEYBOARD AS BULSTRODE SHOULD SAY HIS INSIDE WAS THAT BLACKAS IF THE HAIRS OF HIS HEAD KNOWED THE THOUGHTS OF HIS HEART HED TEAREM UP BY THE ROOTS.THATS ODD SAID MR. LIMP A MEDITATIVE SHOEMAKER WITH WEAK EYES ANDA PIPING VOICE. WHY I READ IN THE TRUMPET THAT WAS WHAT THE DUKE OFWELLINGTON SAID WHEN HE TURNED HIS COAT AND WENT OVER TO THE ROMANS.VERY LIKE SAID MRS. DOLLOP. IF ONE RASKILL SAID IT ITS MOREREASON WHY ANOTHER SHOULD. BUT HYPOCRITE AS HES BEEN AND HOLDINGTHINGS WITH THAT HIGH HAND AS THERE WAS NO PARSON I THE COUNTRY GOODENOUGH FOR HIM HE WAS FORCED TO TAKE OLD HARRY INTO HIS COUNSEL ANDOLD HARRYS BEEN TOO MANY FOR HIM.AY AY HES A COMPLICE YOU CANT SEND OUT O THE COUNTRY SAID MR.CRABBE THE GLAZIER WHO GATHERED MUCH NEWS AND GROPED AMONG IT DIMLY.BUT BY WHAT I CAN MAKE OUT THERES THEM SAYS BULSTRODE WAS FORRUNNING AWAY FOR FEAR O BEING FOUND OUT BEFORE NOW.HELL BE DROVE AWAY WHETHER OR NO SAID MR. DILL THE BARBER WHOHAD JUST DROPPED IN. I SHAVED FLETCHER HAWLEYS CLERK THISMORNINGHES GOT A BAD FINGERAND HE SAYS THEYRE ALL OF ONE MIND TOGET RID OF BULSTRODE. MR.

LIMP QUAVERINGLY.AH THERES BETTER FOLKS SPEND THEIR MONEY WORSE SAID A FIRMVOICEDDYER WHOSE CRIMSON HANDS LOOKED OUT OF KEEPING WITH HIS GOODNATUREDFACE.BUT HE WONT KEEP HIS MONEY BY WHAT I CAN MAKE OUT SAID THEGLAZIER. DONT THEY SAY AS THERES SOMEBODY CAN STRIP IT OFF HIM BYWHAT I CAN UNDERSTAN THEY COULD TAKE EVERY PENNY OFF HIM IF THEYWENT TO LAWING.NO SUCH THING SAID THE BARBER WHO FELT HIMSELF A LITTLE ABOVE HISCOMPANY AT DOLLOPS BUT LIKED IT NONE THE WORSE. FLETCHER SAYS ITSNO SUCH THING. HE SAYS THEY MIGHT PROVE OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHOSE CHILDTHIS YOUNG LADISLAW WAS AND THEYD DO NO MORE THAN IF THEY PROVED ICAME OUT OF THE FENSHE COULDNT TOUCH A PENNY.LOOK YOU THERE NOW SAID MRS. DOLLOP INDIGNANTLY. I THANK THE LORDHE TOOK MY CHILDREN TO HIMSELF IF THATS ALL THE LAW CAN DO FOR THEMOTHERLESS. THEN BY THAT ITS O NO USE WHO YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER IS.BUT AS TO LISTENING TO WHAT ONE LAWYER SAYS WITHOUT ASKING ANOTHERIWONDER AT A MAN O YOUR CLEVERNESS MR. DILL. ITS WELL KNOWN THERESALWAYS TWO SIDES IF NO MORE ELSE WHOD GO TO LAW I SHOULD LIKE TOKNOW ITS A POOR TALE WITH ALL THE LAW AS THERE IS UP AND DOWN IFITS NO USE PROVING WHOSE CHILD YOU ARE. FLETCHER MAY SAY THAT IF HELIKES BUT I SAY DONT FLETCHER MEMR. DILL AFFECTED TO LAUGH IN A COMPLIMENTARY WAY AT MRS. DOLLOP AS AWOMAN WHO WAS MORE THAN A MATCH FOR THE LAWYERS BEING DISPOSED TOSUBMIT TO MUCH TWITTING FROM A LANDLADY WHO HAD A LONG SCORE AGAINSTHIM.IF THEY COME TO LAWING AND ITS ALL TRUE AS FOLKS SAY THERES MORETO BE LOOKED TO NOR MONEY SAID THE GLAZIER. THERES THIS POORCREETUR AS IS DEAD AND GONE BY WHAT I CAN MAKE OUT HED SEEN THE DAYWHEN HE WAS A DEAL FINER GENTLEMAN NOR BULSTRODE.FINER GENTLEMAN ILL WARRANT HIM SAID MRS.

DOLLOP LOOKED ROUND WITH THE AIR OF A LANDLADY ACCUSTOMED TODOMINATE HER COMPANY. THERE WAS A CHORUS OF ADHESION FROM THE MORECOURAGEOUS BUT MR. LIMP AFTER TAKING A DRAUGHT PLACED HIS FLAT HANDSTOGETHER AND PRESSED THEM HARD BETWEEN HIS KNEES LOOKING DOWN AT THEMWITH BLEAREYED CONTEMPLATION AS IF THE SCORCHING POWER OF MRS.DOLLOPS SPEECH HAD QUITE DRIED UP AND NULLIFIED HIS WITS UNTIL THEYCOULD BE BROUGHT ROUND AGAIN BY FURTHER MOISTURE.WHY SHOULDNT THEY DIG THE MAN UP AND HAVE THE CROWNER SAID THEDYER. ITS BEEN DONE MANY AND MANYS THE TIME. IF THERES BEEN FOULPLAY THEY MIGHT FIND IT OUT.NOT THEY MR. JONAS SAID MRS DOLLOP EMPHATICALLY. I KNOW WHATDOCTORS ARE. THEYRE A DEAL TOO CUNNING TO BE FOUND OUT. AND THISDOCTOR LYDGATE THATS BEEN FOR CUTTING UP EVERYBODY BEFORE THE BREATHWAS WELL OUT O THEIR BODYITS PLAIN ENOUGH WHAT USE HE WANTED TO MAKEO LOOKING INTO RESPECTABLE PEOPLES INSIDES. HE KNOWS DRUGS YOU MAYBE SURE AS YOU CAN NEITHER SMELL NOR SEE NEITHER BEFORE THEYRESWALLOWED NOR AFTER. WHY IVE SEEN DROPS MYSELF ORDERED BY DOCTORGAMBIT AS IS OUR CLUB DOCTOR AND A GOOD CHARIKTER AND HAS BROUGHTMORE LIVE CHILDREN INTO THE WORLD NOR EVER ANOTHER I MIDDLEMARCHI SAYIVE SEEN DROPS MYSELF AS MADE NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER THEY WAS IN THEGLASS OR OUT AND YET HAVE GRIPED YOU THE NEXT DAY. SO ILL LEAVE YOUROWN SENSE TO JUDGE. DONT TELL ME ALL I SAY IS ITS A MERCY THEYDIDNT TAKE THIS DOCTOR LYDGATE ON TO OUR CLUB. THERES MANY A MOTHERSCHILD MIGHT HA RUED IT.THE HEADS OF THIS DISCUSSION AT DOLLOPS HAD BEEN THE COMMON THEMEAMONG ALL CLASSES IN THE TOWN HAD BEEN CARRIED TO LOWICK PARSONAGE ONONE SIDE AND TO TIPTON GRANGE ON THE OTHER HAD COME FULLY TO THE EARSOF THE VINCY FAMILY AND HAD BEEN DISCUSSED WITH SAD REFERENCE TO POORHARRIET BY ALL MRS. BULSTRODES FRIENDS BEFORE LYDGATE KNEWDISTINCTLY WHY PEOPLE WERE LOOKING STRANGELY AT HIM AND BEFOREBULSTRODE HIMSELF SUSPECTED THE BETRAYAL OF HIS SECRETS. HE HAD NOTBEEN ACCUSTOMED TO VERY CORDIAL RELATIONS WITH HIS NEIGHBORS AND HENCEHE COULD NOT MISS THE SIGNS OF CORDIALITY MOREOVER HE HAD BEEN TAKINGJOURNEYS ON BUSINESS OF VARIOUS KINDS HAVING NOW MADE UP HIS MIND THATHE NEED NOT QUIT MIDDLEMARCH AND FEELING ABLE CONSEQUENTLY TODETERMINE ON MATTERS WHICH HE HAD BEFORE LEFT IN SUSPENSE.WE WILL MAKE A JOURNEY TO CHELTENHAM IN THE COURSE OF A MONTH OR TWOHE HAD SAID TO HIS WIFE. THERE ARE GREAT SPIRITUAL ADVANTAGES TO BEHAD IN THAT TOWN ALONG WITH THE AIR AND THE WATERS AND SIX WEEKS THEREWILL BE EMINENTLY REFRESHING TO US.HE REALLY BELIEVED IN THE SPIRITUAL ADVANTAGES AND MEANT THAT HIS LIFEHENCEFORTH SHOULD BE THE MORE DEVOTED BECAUSE OF THOSE LATER SINS WHICHHE REPRESENTED TO HIMSELF AS HYPOTHETIC PRAYING HYPOTHETICALLY FORTHEIR PARDONIF I HAVE HEREIN TRANSGRESSED.AS TO THE HOSPITAL HE AVOIDED SAYING ANYTHING FURTHER TO LYDGATEFEARING TO MANIFEST A TOO SUDDEN CHANGE OF PLANS IMMEDIATELY ON THEDEATH OF RAFFLES. IN HIS SECRET SOUL HE BELIEVED THAT LYDGATE SUSPECTEDHIS ORDERS TO HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY DISOBEYED AND SUSPECTING THIS HEMUST ALSO SUSPECT A MOTIVE. BUT NOTHING HAD BEEN BETRAYED TO HIM AS TOTHE HISTORY OF RAFFLES AND BULSTRODE WAS ANXIOUS NOT TO DO ANYTHINGWHICH WOULD GIVE EMPHASIS TO HIS UNDEFINED SUSPICIONS. AS TO ANYCERTAINTY THAT A PARTICULAR METHOD OF TREATMENT WOULD EITHER SAVE ORKILL LYDGATE HIMSELF WAS CONSTANTLY ARGUING AGAINST SUCH DOGMATISM HEHAD NO RIGHT TO SPEAK AND HE HAD EVERY MOTIVE FOR BEING SILENT. HENCEBULSTRODE FELT HIMSELF PROVIDENTIALLY SECURED. THE ONLY INCIDENT HE HADSTRONGLY WINCED UNDER HAD BEEN AN OCCASIONAL ENCOUNTER WITH CALEBGARTH WHO HOWEVER HAD RAISED HIS HAT WITH MILD GRAVITY.MEANWHILE ON THE PART OF THE PRINCIPAL TOWNSMEN A STRONG DETERMINATIONWAS GROWING AGAINST HIM.A MEETING WAS TO BE HELD IN THE TOWNHALL ON A SANITARY QUESTION WHICHHAD RISEN INTO PRESSING IMPORTANCE BY THE OCCURRENCE OF A CHOLERA CASEIN THE TOWN. SINCE THE ACT OF PARLIAMENT WHICH HAD BEEN HURRIEDLYPASSED AUTHORIZING ASSESSMENTS FOR SANITARY MEASURES THERE HAD BEEN ABOARD FOR THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF SUCH MEASURES APPOINTED INMIDDLEMARCH AND MUCH CLEANSING AND PREPARATION HAD BEEN CONCURRED INBY WHIGS AND TORIES. THE QUESTION NOW WAS WHETHER A PIECE OF GROUNDOUTSIDE THE TOWN SHOULD BE SECURED AS A BURIALGROUND BY MEANS OFASSESSMENT OR BY PRIVATE SUBSCRIPTION. THE MEETING WAS TO BE OPEN ANDALMOST EVERYBODY OF IMPORTANCE IN THE TOWN WAS EXPECTED TO BE THERE.MR. BULSTRODE WAS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD AND JUST BEFORE TWELVE OCLOCKHE STARTED FROM THE BANK WITH THE INTENTION OF URGING THE PLAN OFPRIVATE SUBSCRIPTION. UNDER THE HESITATION OF HIS PROJECTS HE HAD FORSOME TIME KEPT HIMSELF IN THE BACKGROUND AND HE FELT THAT HE SHOULDTHIS MORNING RESUME HIS OLD POSITION AS A MAN OF ACTION AND INFLUENCEIN THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OF THE TOWN WHERE HE EXPECTED TO END HIS DAYS.AMONG THE VARIOUS PERSONS GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION HE SAW LYDGATETHEY JOINED TALKED OVER THE OBJECT OF THE MEETING AND ENTERED ITTOGETHER.IT SEEMED THAT EVERYBODY OF MARK HAD BEEN EARLIER THAN THEY. BUT THEREWERE STILL SPACES LEFT NEAR THE HEAD OF THE LARGE CENTRAL TABLE ANDTHEY MADE THEIR WAY THITHER. MR. FAREBROTHER SAT OPPOSITE NOT FAR FROMMR. HAWLEY ALL THE MEDICAL MEN WERE THERE MR. THESIGER WAS IN THECHAIR AND MR. BROOKE OF TIPTON WAS ON HIS RIGHT HAND.LYDGATE NOTICED A PECULIAR INTERCHANGE OF GLANCES WHEN HE AND BULSTRODETOOK THEIR SEATS.AFTER THE BUSINESS HAD BEEN FULLY OPENED BY THE CHAIRMAN WHO POINTEDOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF PURCHASING BY SUBSCRIPTION A PIECE OF GROUNDLARGE ENOUGH TO BE ULTIMATELY USED AS A GENERAL CEMETERY MR.BULSTRODE WHOSE RATHER HIGHPITCHED BUT SUBDUED AND FLUENT VOICE THETOWN WAS USED TO AT MEETINGS OF THIS SORT ROSE AND ASKED LEAVE TODELIVER HIS OPINION. LYDGATE COULD SEE AGAIN THE PECULIAR INTERCHANGEOF GLANCES BEFORE MR. HAWLEY STARTED UP AND SAID IN HIS FIRM RESONANTVOICE MR. CHAIRMAN I REQUEST THAT BEFORE ANY ONE DELIVERS HISOPINION ON THIS POINT I MAY BE PERMITTED TO SPEAK ON A QUESTION OFPUBLIC FEELING WHICH NOT ONLY BY MYSELF BUT BY MANY GENTLEMENPRESENT IS REGARDED AS PRELIMINARY.MR. HAWLEYS MODE OF SPEECH EVEN WHEN PUBLIC DECORUM REPRESSED HISAWFUL LANGUAGE WAS FORMIDABLE IN ITS CURTNESS AND SELFPOSSESSION.MR. THESIGER SANCTIONED THE REQUEST MR. BULSTRODE SAT DOWN AND MR.HAWLEY CONTINUED.IN WHAT I HAVE TO SAY MR. CHAIRMAN I AM NOT SPEAKING SIMPLY ON MYOWN BEHALF I AM SPEAKING WITH THE CONCURRENCE AND AT THE EXPRESSREQUEST OF NO FEWER THAN EIGHT OF MY FELLOWTOWNSMEN WHO AREIMMEDIATELY AROUND US. IT IS OUR UNITED SENTIMENT THAT MR. BULSTRODESHOULD BE CALLED UPONAND I DO NOW CALL UPON HIMTO RESIGN PUBLICPOSITIONS WHICH HE HOLDS NOT SIMPLY AS A TAXPAYER BUT AS A GENTLEMANAMONG GENTLEMEN. THERE ARE PRACTICES AND THERE ARE ACTS WHICH OWING TOCIRCUMSTANCES THE LAW CANNOT VISIT THOUGH THEY MAY BE WORSE THAN MANYTHINGS WHICH ARE LEGALLY PUNISHABLE. HONEST MEN AND GENTLEMEN IF THEYDONT WANT THE COMPANY OF PEOPLE WHO PERPETRATE SUCH ACTS HAVE GOT TODEFEND THEMSELVES AS THEY BEST CAN AND THAT IS WHAT I AND THE FRIENDSWHOM I MAY CALL MY CLIENTS IN THIS AFFAIR ARE DETERMINED TO DO. I DONTSAY THAT MR. BULSTRODE HAS BEEN GUILTY OF SHAMEFUL ACTS BUT I CALLUPON HIM EITHER PUBLICLY TO DENY AND CONFUTE THE SCANDALOUS STATEMENTSMADE AGAINST HIM BY A MAN NOW DEAD AND WHO DIED IN HIS HOUSETHESTATEMENT THAT HE WAS FOR MANY YEARS ENGAGED IN NEFARIOUS PRACTICESAND THAT HE WON HIS FORTUNE BY DISHONEST PROCEDURESOR ELSE TO WITHDRAWFROM POSITIONS WHICH COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN ALLOWED HIM AS A GENTLEMANAMONG GENTLEMEN.ALL EYES IN THE ROOM WERE TURNED ON MR. BULSTRODE WHO SINCE THE FIRSTMENTION OF HIS NAME HAD BEEN GOING THROUGH A CRISIS OF FEELING ALMOSTTOO VIOLENT FOR HIS DELICATE FRAME TO SUPPORT. LYDGATE WHO HIMSELF WASUNDERGOING A SHOCK AS FROM THE TERRIBLE PRACTICAL INTERPRETATION OFSOME FAINT AUGURY FELT NEVERTHELESS THAT HIS OWN MOVEMENT OFRESENTFUL HATRED WAS CHECKED BY THAT INSTINCT OF THE HEALER WHICHTHINKS FIRST OF BRINGING RESCUE OR RELIEF TO THE SUFFERER WHEN HELOOKED AT THE SHRUNKEN MISERY OF BULSTRODES LIVID FACE.THE QUICK VISION THAT HIS LIFE WAS AFTER ALL A FAILURE THAT HE WAS ADISHONORED MAN AND MUST QUAIL BEFORE THE GLANCE OF THOSE TOWARDS WHOMHE HAD HABITUALLY ASSUMED THE ATTITUDE OF A REPROVERTHAT GOD HADDISOWNED HIM BEFORE MEN AND LEFT HIM UNSCREENED TO THE TRIUMPHANT SCORNOF THOSE WHO WERE GLAD TO HAVE THEIR HATRED JUSTIFIEDTHE SENSE OFUTTER FUTILITY IN THAT EQUIVOCATION WITH HIS CONSCIENCE IN DEALING WITHTHE LIFE OF HIS ACCOMPLICE AN EQUIVOCATION WHICH NOW TURNED VENOMOUSLYUPON HIM WITH THE FULLGROWN FANG OF A DISCOVERED LIEALL THIS RUSHEDTHROUGH HIM LIKE THE AGONY OF TERROR WHICH FAILS TO KILL AND LEAVESTHE EARS STILL OPEN TO THE RETURNING WAVE OF EXECRATION. THE SUDDENSENSE OF EXPOSURE AFTER THE REESTABLISHED SENSE OF SAFETY CAMENOT TOTHE COARSE ORGANIZATION OF A CRIMINAL BUT TO THE SUSCEPTIBLE NERVE OFA MAN WHOSE INTENSEST BEING LAY IN SUCH MASTERY AND PREDOMINANCE AS THECONDITIONS OF HIS LIFE HAD SHAPED FOR HIM.BUT IN THAT INTENSE BEING LAY THE STRENGTH OF REACTION. THROUGH ALL HISBODILY INFIRMITY THERE RAN A TENACIOUS NERVE OF AMBITIOUSSELFPRESERVING WILL WHICH HAD CONTINUALLY LEAPED OUT LIKE A FLAMESCATTERING ALL DOCTRINAL FEARS AND WHICH EVEN WHILE HE SAT AN OBJECTOF COMPASSION FOR THE MERCIFUL WAS BEGINNING TO STIR AND GLOW UNDERHIS ASHY PALENESS. BEFORE THE LAST WORDS WERE OUT OF MR. HAWLEYSMOUTH BULSTRODE FELT THAT HE SHOULD ANSWER AND THAT HIS ANSWER WOULDBE A RETORT. HE DARED NOT GET UP AND SAY I AM NOT GUILTY THE WHOLESTORY IS FALSEEVEN IF HE HAD DARED THIS IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO HIMUNDER HIS PRESENT KEEN SENSE OF BETRAYAL AS VAIN AS TO PULL FORCOVERING TO HIS NAKEDNESS A FRAIL RAG WHICH WOULD REND AT EVERY LITTLESTRAIN.FOR A FEW MOMENTS THERE WAS TOTAL SILENCE WHILE EVERY MAN IN THE ROOMWAS LOOKING AT BULSTRODE. HE SAT PERFECTLY STILL LEANING HARD AGAINSTTHE BACK OF HIS CHAIR HE COULD NOT VENTURE TO RISE AND WHEN HE BEGANTO SPEAK HE PRESSED HIS HANDS UPON THE SEAT ON EACH SIDE OF HIM. BUTHIS VOICE WAS PERFECTLY AUDIBLE THOUGH HOARSER THAN USUAL AND HISWORDS WERE DISTINCTLY PRONOUNCED THOUGH HE PAUSED BETWEEN SENTENCE ASIF SHORT OF BREATH. HE SAID TURNING FIRST TOWARD MR. THESIGER ANDTHEN LOOKING AT MR. HAWLEYI PROTEST BEFORE YOU SIR AS A CHRISTIAN MINISTER AGAINST THESANCTION OF PROCEEDINGS TOWARDS ME WHICH ARE DICTATED BY VIRULENTHATRED. THOSE WHO ARE HOSTILE TO ME ARE GLAD TO BELIEVE ANY LIBELUTTERED BY A LOOSE TONGUE AGAINST ME. AND THEIR CONSCIENCES BECOMESTRICT AGAINST ME. SAY THAT THE EVILSPEAKING OF WHICH I AM TO BE MADETHE VICTIM ACCUSES ME OF MALPRACTICES HERE BULSTRODES VOICE ROSE ANDTOOK ON A MORE BITING ACCENT TILL IT SEEMED A LOW CRYWHO SHALL BE MYACCUSER NOT MEN WHOSE OWN LIVES ARE UNCHRISTIAN NAY SCANDALOUSNOTMEN WHO THEMSELVES USE LOW INSTRUMENTS TO CARRY OUT THEIR ENDSWHOSEPROFESSION IS A TISSUE OF CHICANERYWHO HAVE BEEN SPENDING THEIR INCOMEON THEIR OWN SENSUAL ENJOYMENTS WHILE I HAVE BEEN DEVOTING MINE TOADVANCE THE BEST OBJECTS WITH REGARD TO THIS LIFE AND THE NEXT.AFTER THE WORD CHICANERY THERE WAS A GROWING NOISE HALF OF MURMURS ANDHALF OF HISSES WHILE FOUR PERSONS STARTED UP AT ONCEMR. HAWLEY MR.TOLLER MR. CHICHELY AND MR. HACKBUTT BUT MR. HAWLEYS OUTBURST WASINSTANTANEOUS AND LEFT THE OTHERS BEHIND IN SILENCE.IF YOU MEAN ME SIR I CALL YOU AND EVERY ONE ELSE TO THE INSPECTIONOF MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE. AS TO CHRISTIAN OR UNCHRISTIAN I REPUDIATEYOUR CANTING PALAVERING CHRISTIANITY AND AS TO THE WAY IN WHICH ISPEND MY INCOME IT IS NOT MY PRINCIPLE TO MAINTAIN THIEVES AND CHEATOFFSPRING OF THEIR DUE INHERITANCE IN ORDER TO SUPPORT RELIGION AND SETMYSELF UP AS A SAINTLY KILLJOY. I AFFECT NO NICENESS OF CONSCIENCEIHAVE NOT FOUND ANY NICE STANDARDS NECESSARY YET TO MEASURE YOUR ACTIONSBY SIR. AND I AGAIN CALL UPON YOU TO ENTER INTO SATISFACTORYEXPLANATIONS CONCERNING THE SCANDALS AGAINST YOU OR ELSE TO WITHDRAWFROM POSTS IN WHICH WE AT ANY RATE DECLINE YOU AS A COLLEAGUE. I SAYSIR WE DECLINE TO COOPERATE WITH A MAN WHOSE CHARACTER IS NOT CLEAREDFROM INFAMOUS LIGHTS CAST UPON IT NOT ONLY BY REPORTS BUT BY RECENTACTIONS.ALLOW ME MR. HAWLEY SAID THE CHAIRMAN AND MR. HAWLEY STILLFUMING BOWED HALF IMPATIENTLY AND SAT DOWN WITH HIS HANDS THRUST DEEPIN HIS POCKETS.MR. BULSTRODE IT IS NOT DESIRABLE I THINK TO PROLONG THE PRESENTDISCUSSION SAID MR. THESIGER TURNING TO THE PALLID TREMBLING MAN IMUST SO FAR CONCUR WITH WHAT HAS FALLEN FROM MR. HAWLEY IN EXPRESSIONOF A GENERAL FEELING AS TO THINK IT DUE TO YOUR CHRISTIAN PROFESSIONTHAT YOU SHOULD CLEAR YOURSELF IF POSSIBLE FROM UNHAPPY ASPERSIONS. IFOR MY PART SHOULD BE WILLING TO GIVE YOU FULL OPPORTUNITY AND HEARING.BUT I MUST SAY THAT YOUR PRESENT ATTITUDE IS PAINFULLY INCONSISTENTWITH THOSE PRINCIPLES WHICH YOU HAVE SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF WITHAND FOR THE HONOR OF WHICH I AM BOUND TO CARE. I RECOMMEND YOU ATPRESENT AS YOUR CLERGYMAN AND ONE WHO HOPES FOR YOUR REINSTATEMENT INRESPECT TO QUIT THE ROOM AND AVOID FURTHER HINDRANCE TO BUSINESS.BULSTRODE AFTER A MOMENTS HESITATION TOOK HIS HAT FROM THE FLOOR ANDSLOWLY ROSE BUT HE GRASPED THE CORNER OF THE CHAIR SO TOTTERINGLY THATLYDGATE FELT SURE THERE WAS NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH IN HIM TO WALK AWAYWITHOUT SUPPORT. WHAT COULD HE DO HE COULD NOT SEE A MAN SINK CLOSE TOHIM FOR WANT OF HELP. HE ROSE AND GAVE HIS ARM TO BULSTRODE AND INTHAT WAY LED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM YET THIS ACT WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEENONE OF GENTLE DUTY AND PURE COMPASSION WAS AT THIS MOMENT UNSPEAKABLYBITTER TO HIM. IT SEEMED AS IF HE WERE PUTTING HIS SIGNMANUAL TO THATASSOCIATION OF HIMSELF WITH BULSTRODE OF WHICH HE NOW SAW THE FULLMEANING AS IT MUST HAVE PRESENTED ITSELF TO OTHER MINDS. HE NOW FELTTHE CONVICTION THAT THIS MAN WHO WAS LEANING TREMBLINGLY ON HIS ARMHAD GIVEN HIM THE THOUSAND POUNDS AS A BRIBE AND THAT SOMEHOW THETREATMENT OF RAFFLES HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH FROM AN EVIL MOTIVE. THEINFERENCES WERE CLOSELY LINKED ENOUGH THE TOWN KNEW OF THE LOANBELIEVED IT TO BE A BRIBE AND BELIEVED THAT HE TOOK IT AS A BRIBE.POOR LYDGATE HIS MIND STRUGGLING UNDER THE TERRIBLE CLUTCH OF THISREVELATION WAS ALL THE WHILE MORALLY FORCED TO TAKE MR. BULSTRODE TOTHE BANK SEND A MAN OFF FOR HIS CARRIAGE AND WAIT TO ACCOMPANY HIMHOME.MEANWHILE THE BUSINESS OF THE MEETING WAS DESPATCHED AND FRINGED OFFINTO EAGER DISCUSSION AMONG VARIOUS GROUPS CONCERNING THIS AFFAIR OFBULSTRODEAND LYDGATE.MR. BROOKE WHO HAD BEFORE HEARD ONLY IMPERFECT HINTS OF IT AND WASVERY UNEASY THAT HE HAD GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR IN COUNTENANCINGBULSTRODE NOW GOT HIMSELF FULLY INFORMED AND FELT SOME BENEVOLENTSADNESS IN TALKING TO MR. FAREBROTHER ABOUT THE UGLY LIGHT IN WHICHLYDGATE HAD COME TO BE REGARDED. MR. FAREBROTHER WAS GOING TO WALK BACKTO LOWICK.STEP INTO MY CARRIAGE SAID MR. BROOKE. I AM GOING ROUND TO SEE MRS.CASAUBON. SHE WAS TO COME BACK FROM YORKSHIRE LAST NIGHT. SHE WILL LIKETO SEE ME YOU KNOW.SO THEY DROVE ALONG MR. BROOKE CHATTING WITH GOODNATURED HOPE THATTHERE HAD NOT REALLY BEEN ANYTHING BLACK IN LYDGATES BEHAVIORA YOUNGFELLOW WHOM HE HAD SEEN TO BE QUITE ABOVE THE COMMON MARK WHEN HEBROUGHT A LETTER FROM HIS UNCLE SIR GODWIN. MR. FAREBROTHER SAIDLITTLE HE WAS DEEPLY MOURNFUL WITH A KEEN PERCEPTION OF HUMANWEAKNESS HE COULD NOT BE CONFIDENT THAT UNDER THE PRESSURE OFHUMILIATING NEEDS LYDGATE HAD NOT FALLEN BELOW HIMSELF.WHEN THE CARRIAGE DROVE UP TO THE GATE OF THE MANOR DOROTHEA WAS OUTON THE GRAVEL AND CAME TO GREET THEM.WELL MY DEAR SAID MR. BROOKE WE HAVE JUST COME FROM A MEETINGASANITARY MEETING YOU KNOW.WAS MR. LYDGATE THERE SAID DOROTHEA WHO LOOKED FULL OF HEALTH ANDANIMATION AND STOOD WITH HER HEAD BARE UNDER THE GLEAMING APRILLIGHTS. I WANT TO SEE HIM AND HAVE A GREAT CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUTTHE HOSPITAL. I HAVE ENGAGED WITH MR. BULSTRODE TO DO SO.OH MY DEAR SAID MR. BROOKE WE HAVE BEEN HEARING BAD NEWSBADNEWS YOU KNOW.THEY WALKED THROUGH THE GARDEN TOWARDS THE CHURCHYARD GATE MR.FAREBROTHER WANTING TO GO ON TO THE PARSONAGE AND DOROTHEA HEARD THEWHOLE SAD STORY.SHE LISTENED WITH DEEP INTEREST AND BEGGED TO HEAR TWICE OVER THEFACTS AND IMPRESSIONS CONCERNING LYDGATE. AFTER A SHORT SILENCEPAUSING AT THE CHURCHYARD GATE AND ADDRESSING MR. FAREBROTHER SHESAID ENERGETICALLYYOU DONT BELIEVE THAT MR. LYDGATE IS GUILTY OF ANYTHING BASE I WILLNOT BELIEVE IT. LET US FIND OUT THE TRUTH AND CLEAR HIMBOOK VIII.SUNSET AND SUNRISE.CHAPTER LXXII.FULL SOULS ARE DOUBLE MIRRORS MAKING STILLAN ENDLESS VISTA OF FAIR THINGS BEFOREREPEATING THINGS BEHIND.DOROTHEAS IMPETUOUS GENEROSITY WHICH WOULD HAVE LEAPED AT ONCE TO THEVINDICATION OF LYDGATE FROM THE SUSPICION OF HAVING ACCEPTED MONEY AS ABRIBE UNDERWENT A MELANCHOLY CHECK WHEN SHE CAME TO CONSIDER ALL THECIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE BY THE LIGHT OF MR. FAREBROTHERS EXPERIENCE.IT IS A DELICATE MATTER TO TOUCH HE SAID. HOW CAN WE BEGIN TOINQUIRE INTO IT IT MUST BE EITHER PUBLICLY BY SETTING THE MAGISTRATEAND CORONER TO WORK OR PRIVATELY BY QUESTIONING LYDGATE. AS TO THEFIRST PROCEEDING THERE IS NO SOLID GROUND TO GO UPON ELSE HAWLEY WOULDHAVE ADOPTED IT AND AS TO OPENING THE SUBJECT WITH LYDGATE I CONFESSI SHOULD SHRINK FROM IT. HE WOULD PROBABLY TAKE IT AS A DEADLY INSULT.I HAVE MORE THAN ONCE EXPERIENCED THE DIFFICULTY OF SPEAKING TO HIM ONPERSONAL MATTERS. ANDONE SHOULD KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS CONDUCTBEFOREHAND TO FEEL VERY CONFIDENT OF A GOOD RESULT.I FEEL CONVINCED THAT HIS CONDUCT HAS NOT BEEN GUILTY I BELIEVE THATPEOPLE ARE ALMOST ALWAYS BETTER THAN THEIR NEIGHBORS THINK THEY ARESAID DOROTHEA. SOME OF HER INTENSEST EXPERIENCE IN THE LAST TWO YEARSHAD SET HER MIND STRONGLY IN OPPOSITION TO ANY UNFAVORABLE CONSTRUCTIONOF OTHERS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE FELT RATHER DISCONTENTED WITH MR.FAREBROTHER. SHE DISLIKED THIS CAUTIOUS WEIGHING OF CONSEQUENCESINSTEAD OF AN ARDENT FAITH IN EFFORTS OF JUSTICE AND MERCY WHICH WOULDCONQUER BY THEIR EMOTIONAL FORCE. TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS HE WAS DINING ATTHE MANOR WITH HER UNCLE AND THE CHETTAMS AND WHEN THE DESSERT WASSTANDING UNEATEN THE SERVANTS WERE OUT OF THE ROOM AND MR. BROOKE WASNODDING IN A NAP SHE RETURNED TO THE SUBJECT WITH RENEWED VIVACITY.MR. LYDGATE WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IF HIS FRIENDS HEAR A CALUMNY ABOUTHIM THEIR FIRST WISH MUST BE TO JUSTIFY HIM. WHAT DO WE LIVE FOR IF ITIS NOT TO MAKE LIFE LESS DIFFICULT TO EACH OTHER I CANNOT BEINDIFFERENT TO THE TROUBLES OF A MAN WHO ADVISED ME IN MY TROUBLEAND ATTENDED ME IN MY ILLNESS.DOROTHEAS TONE AND MANNER WERE NOT MORE ENERGETIC THAN THEY HAD BEENWHEN SHE WAS AT THE HEAD OF HER UNCLES TABLE NEARLY THREE YEARSBEFORE AND HER EXPERIENCE SINCE HAD GIVEN HER MORE RIGHT TO EXPRESS ADECIDED OPINION. BUT SIR JAMES CHETTAM WAS NO LONGER THE DIFFIDENT ANDACQUIESCENT SUITOR HE WAS THE ANXIOUS BROTHERINLAW WITH A DEVOUTADMIRATION FOR HIS SISTER BUT WITH A CONSTANT ALARM LEST SHE SHOULDFALL UNDER SOME NEW ILLUSION ALMOST AS BAD AS MARRYING CASAUBON. HESMILED MUCH LESS WHEN HE SAID EXACTLY IT WAS MORE OFTEN ANINTRODUCTION TO A DISSENTIENT OPINION THAN IN THOSE SUBMISSIVE BACHELORDAYS AND DOROTHEA FOUND TO HER SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD TO RESOLVE NOT TOBE AFRAID OF HIMALL THE MORE BECAUSE HE WAS REALLY HER BEST FRIEND. HEDISAGREED WITH HER NOW.BUT DOROTHEA HE SAID REMONSTRANTLY YOU CANT UNDERTAKE TO MANAGEA MANS LIFE FOR HIM IN THAT WAY. LYDGATE MUST KNOWAT LEAST HE WILLSOON COME TO KNOW HOW HE STANDS. IF HE CAN CLEAR HIMSELF HE WILL. HEMUST ACT FOR HIMSELF.I THINK HIS FRIENDS MUST WAIT TILL THEY FIND AN OPPORTUNITY ADDEDMR. FAREBROTHER. IT IS POSSIBLEI HAVE OFTEN FELT SO MUCH WEAKNESS INMYSELF THAT I CAN CONCEIVE EVEN A MAN OF HONORABLE DISPOSITION SUCH ASI HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED LYDGATE TO BE SUCCUMBING TO SUCH A TEMPTATIONAS THAT OF ACCEPTING MONEY WHICH WAS OFFERED MORE OR LESS INDIRECTLY ASA BRIBE TO INSURE HIS SILENCE ABOUT SCANDALOUS FACTS LONG GONE BY. ISAY I CAN CONCEIVE THIS IF HE WERE UNDER THE PRESSURE OF HARDCIRCUMSTANCESIF HE HAD BEEN HARASSED AS I FEEL SURE LYDGATE HAS BEEN.I WOULD NOT BELIEVE ANYTHING WORSE OF HIM EXCEPT UNDER STRINGENT PROOF.BUT THERE IS THE TERRIBLE NEMESIS FOLLOWING ON SOME ERRORS THAT IT ISALWAYS POSSIBLE FOR THOSE WHO LIKE IT TO INTERPRET THEM INTO A CRIMETHERE IS NO PROOF IN FAVOR OF THE MAN OUTSIDE HIS OWN CONSCIOUSNESS ANDASSERTION.OH HOW CRUEL SAID DOROTHEA CLASPING HER HANDS. AND WOULD YOU NOTLIKE TO BE THE ONE PERSON WHO BELIEVED IN THAT MANS INNOCENCE IF THEREST OF THE WORLD BELIED HIM BESIDES THERE IS A MANS CHARACTERBEFOREHAND TO SPEAK FOR HIM.BUT MY DEAR MRS. CASAUBON SAID MR. FAREBROTHER SMILING GENTLY ATHER ARDOR CHARACTER IS NOT CUT IN MARBLEIT IS NOT SOMETHING SOLIDAND UNALTERABLE. IT IS SOMETHING LIVING AND CHANGING AND MAY BECOMEDISEASED AS OUR BODIES DO.THEN IT MAY BE RESCUED AND HEALED SAID DOROTHEA I SHOULD NOT BEAFRAID OF ASKING MR. LYDGATE TO TELL ME THE TRUTH THAT I MIGHT HELPHIM. WHY SHOULD I BE AFRAID NOW THAT I AM NOT TO HAVE THE LAND JAMESI MIGHT DO AS MR. BULSTRODE PROPOSED AND TAKE HIS PLACE IN PROVIDINGFOR THE HOSPITAL AND I HAVE TO CONSULT MR. LYDGATE TO KNOW THOROUGHLYWHAT ARE THE PROSPECTS OF DOING GOOD BY KEEPING UP THE PRESENT PLANS.THERE IS THE BEST OPPORTUNITY IN THE WORLD FOR ME TO ASK FOR HISCONFIDENCE AND HE WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL ME THINGS WHICH MIGHT MAKE ALLTHE CIRCUMSTANCES CLEAR. THEN WE WOULD ALL STAND BY HIM AND BRING HIMOUT OF HIS TROUBLE. PEOPLE GLORIFY ALL SORTS OF BRAVERY EXCEPT THEBRAVERY THEY MIGHT SHOW ON BEHALF OF THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBORS.DOROTHEAS EYES HAD A MOIST BRIGHTNESS IN THEM AND THE CHANGED TONESOF HER VOICE ROUSED HER UNCLE WHO BEGAN TO LISTEN.IT IS TRUE THAT A WOMAN MAY VENTURE ON SOME EFFORTS OF SYMPATHY WHICHWOULD HARDLY SUCCEED IF WE MEN UNDERTOOK THEM SAID MR. FAREBROTHERALMOST CONVERTED BY DOROTHEAS ARDOR.SURELY A WOMAN IS BOUND TO BE CAUTIOUS AND LISTEN TO THOSE WHO KNOWTHE WORLD BETTER THAN SHE DOES. SAID SIR JAMES WITH HIS LITTLE FROWN.WHATEVER YOU DO IN THE END DOROTHEA YOU SHOULD REALLY KEEP BACK ATPRESENT AND NOT VOLUNTEER ANY MEDDLING WITH THIS BULSTRODE BUSINESS.WE DONT KNOW YET WHAT MAY TURN UP. YOU MUST AGREE WITH ME HE ENDEDLOOKING AT MR. FAREBROTHER.I DO THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WAIT SAID THE LATTER.YES YES MY DEAR SAID MR. BROOKE NOT QUITE KNOWING AT WHAT POINTTHE DISCUSSION HAD ARRIVED BUT COMING UP TO IT WITH A CONTRIBUTIONWHICH WAS GENERALLY APPROPRIATE. IT IS EASY TO GO TOO FAR YOU KNOW.YOU MUST NOT LET YOUR IDEAS RUN AWAY WITH YOU. AND AS TO BEING IN AHURRY TO PUT MONEY INTO SCHEMESIT WONT DO YOU KNOW. GARTH HAS DRAWNME IN UNCOMMONLY WITH REPAIRS DRAINING THAT SORT OF THING IMUNCOMMONLY OUT OF POCKET WITH ONE THING OR ANOTHER. I MUST PULL UP. ASFOR YOU CHETTAM YOU ARE SPENDING A FORTUNE ON THOSE OAK FENCES ROUNDYOUR DEMESNE.DOROTHEA SUBMITTING UNEASILY TO THIS DISCOURAGEMENT WENT WITH CELIAINTO THE LIBRARY WHICH WAS HER USUAL DRAWINGROOM.NOW DODO DO LISTEN TO WHAT JAMES SAYS SAID CELIA ELSE YOU WILLBE GETTING INTO A SCRAPE. YOU ALWAYS DID AND YOU ALWAYS WILL WHEN YOUSET ABOUT DOING AS YOU PLEASE. AND I THINK IT IS A MERCY NOW AFTER ALLTHAT YOU HAVE GOT JAMES TO THINK FOR YOU. HE LETS YOU HAVE YOUR PLANSONLY HE HINDERS YOU FROM BEING TAKEN IN. AND THAT IS THE GOOD OF HAVINGA BROTHER INSTEAD OF A HUSBAND. A HUSBAND WOULD NOT LET YOU HAVE YOURPLANS.AS IF I WANTED A HUSBAND SAID DOROTHEA. I ONLY WANT NOT TO HAVE MYFEELINGS CHECKED AT EVERY TURN. MRS. CASAUBON WAS STILL UNDISCIPLINEDENOUGH TO BURST INTO ANGRY TEARS.NOW REALLY DODO SAID CELIA WITH RATHER A DEEPER GUTTURAL THANUSUAL YOU ARE CONTRADICTORY FIRST ONE THING AND THEN ANOTHER. YOUUSED TO SUBMIT TO MR. CASAUBON QUITE SHAMEFULLY I THINK YOU WOULD HAVEGIVEN UP EVER COMING TO SEE ME IF HE HAD ASKED YOU.OF COURSE I SUBMITTED TO HIM BECAUSE IT WAS MY DUTY IT WAS MYFEELING FOR HIM SAID DOROTHEA LOOKING THROUGH THE PRISM OF HERTEARS.THEN WHY CANT YOU THINK IT YOUR DUTY TO SUBMIT A LITTLE TO WHAT JAMESWISHES SAID CELIA WITH A SENSE OF STRINGENCY IN HER ARGUMENT.BECAUSE HE ONLY WISHES WHAT IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. AND OF COURSE MENKNOW BEST ABOUT EVERYTHING EXCEPT WHAT WOMEN KNOW BETTER. DOROTHEALAUGHED AND FORGOT HER TEARS.WELL I MEAN ABOUT BABIES AND THOSE THINGS EXPLAINED CELIA. ISHOULD NOT GIVE UP TO JAMES WHEN I KNEW HE WAS WRONG AS YOU USED TO DOTO MR. CASAUBON.CHAPTER LXXIII.PITY THE LADEN ONE THIS WANDERING WOEMAY VISIT YOU AND ME.WHEN LYDGATE HAD ALLAYED MRS. BULSTRODES ANXIETY BY TELLING HER THATHER HUSBAND HAD BEEN SEIZED WITH FAINTNESS AT THE MEETING BUT THAT HETRUSTED SOON TO SEE HIM BETTER AND WOULD CALL AGAIN THE NEXT DAYUNLESS SHE SENT FOR HIM EARLIER HE WENT DIRECTLY HOME GOT ON HISHORSE AND RODE THREE MILES OUT OF THE TOWN FOR THE SAKE OF BEING OUTOF REACH.HE FELT HIMSELF BECOMING VIOLENT AND UNREASONABLE AS IF RAGING UNDERTHE PAIN OF STINGS HE WAS READY TO CURSE THE DAY ON WHICH HE HAD COMETO MIDDLEMARCH. EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM THERE SEEMED A MEREPREPARATION FOR THIS HATEFUL FATALITY WHICH HAD COME AS A BLIGHT ONHIS HONORABLE AMBITION AND MUST MAKE EVEN PEOPLE WHO HAD ONLY VULGARSTANDARDS REGARD HIS REPUTATION AS IRREVOCABLY DAMAGED. IN SUCH MOMENTSA MAN CAN HARDLY ESCAPE BEING UNLOVING. LYDGATE THOUGHT OF HIMSELF ASTHE SUFFERER AND OF OTHERS AS THE AGENTS WHO HAD INJURED HIS LOT. HEHAD MEANT EVERYTHING TO TURN OUT DIFFERENTLY AND OTHERS HAD THRUSTTHEMSELVES INTO HIS LIFE AND THWARTED HIS PURPOSES. HIS MARRIAGE SEEMEDAN UNMITIGATED CALAMITY AND HE WAS AFRAID OF GOING TO ROSAMOND BEFOREHE HAD VENTED HIMSELF IN THIS SOLITARY RAGE LEST THE MERE SIGHT OF HERSHOULD EXASPERATE HIM AND MAKE HIM BEHAVE UNWARRANTABLY. THERE AREEPISODES IN MOST MENS LIVES IN WHICH THEIR HIGHEST QUALITIES CAN ONLYCAST A DETERRING SHADOW OVER THE OBJECTS THAT FILL THEIR INWARD VISIONLYDGATES TENDERHEARTEDNESS WAS PRESENT JUST THEN ONLY AS A DREAD LESTHE SHOULD OFFEND AGAINST IT NOT AS AN EMOTION THAT SWAYED HIM TOTENDERNESS. FOR HE WAS VERY MISERABLE. ONLY THOSE WHO KNOW THESUPREMACY OF THE INTELLECTUAL LIFETHE LIFE WHICH HAS A SEED OFENNOBLING THOUGHT AND PURPOSE WITHIN ITCAN UNDERSTAND THE GRIEF OF ONEWHO FALLS FROM THAT SERENE ACTIVITY INTO THE ABSORBING SOULWASTINGSTRUGGLE WITH WORLDLY ANNOYANCES.HOW WAS HE TO LIVE ON WITHOUT VINDICATING HIMSELF AMONG PEOPLE WHOSUSPECTED HIM OF BASENESS HOW COULD HE GO SILENTLY AWAY FROMMIDDLEMARCH AS IF HE WERE RETREATING BEFORE A JUST CONDEMNATION ANDYET HOW WAS HE TO SET ABOUT VINDICATING HIMSELFFOR THAT SCENE AT THE MEETING WHICH HE HAD JUST WITNESSED ALTHOUGH ITHAD TOLD HIM NO PARTICULARS HAD BEEN ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS OWN SITUATIONTHOROUGHLY CLEAR TO HIM. BULSTRODE HAD BEEN IN DREAD OF SCANDALOUSDISCLOSURES ON THE PART OF RAFFLES. LYDGATE COULD NOW CONSTRUCT ALL THEPROBABILITIES OF THE CASE. HE WAS AFRAID OF SOME BETRAYAL IN MYHEARING ALL HE WANTED WAS TO BIND ME TO HIM BY A STRONG OBLIGATIONTHAT WAS WHY HE PASSED ON A SUDDEN FROM HARDNESS TO LIBERALITY. AND HEMAY HAVE TAMPERED WITH THE PATIENTHE MAY HAVE DISOBEYED MY ORDERS. IFEAR HE DID. BUT WHETHER HE DID OR NOT THE WORLD BELIEVES THAT HESOMEHOW OR OTHER POISONED THE MAN AND THAT I WINKED AT THE CRIME IF IDIDNT HELP IN IT. AND YETAND YET HE MAY NOT BE GUILTY OF THE LASTOFFENCE AND IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT THE CHANGE TOWARDS ME MAY HAVEBEEN A GENUINE RELENTINGTHE EFFECT OF SECOND THOUGHTS SUCH AS HEALLEGED. WHAT WE CALL THE JUST POSSIBLE IS SOMETIMES TRUE AND THETHING WE FIND IT EASIER TO BELIEVE IS GROSSLY FALSE. IN HIS LASTDEALINGS WITH THIS MAN BULSTRODE MAY HAVE KEPT HIS HANDS PURE IN SPITEOF MY SUSPICION TO THE CONTRARY.THERE WAS A BENUMBING CRUELTY IN HIS POSITION. EVEN IF HE RENOUNCEDEVERY OTHER CONSIDERATION THAN THAT OF JUSTIFYING HIMSELFIF HE METSHRUGS COLD GLANCES AND AVOIDANCE AS AN ACCUSATION AND MADE A PUBLICSTATEMENT OF ALL THE FACTS AS HE KNEW THEM WHO WOULD BE CONVINCED ITWOULD BE PLAYING THE PART OF A FOOL TO OFFER HIS OWN TESTIMONY ONBEHALF OF HIMSELF AND SAY I DID NOT TAKE THE MONEY AS A BRIBE. THECIRCUMSTANCES WOULD ALWAYS BE STRONGER THAN HIS ASSERTION. AND BESIDESTO COME FORWARD AND TELL EVERYTHING ABOUT HIMSELF MUST INCLUDEDECLARATIONS ABOUT BULSTRODE WHICH WOULD DARKEN THE SUSPICIONS OFOTHERS AGAINST HIM. HE MUST TELL THAT HE HAD NOT KNOWN OF RAFFLESSEXISTENCE WHEN HE FIRST MENTIONED HIS PRESSING NEED OF MONEY TOBULSTRODE AND THAT HE TOOK THE MONEY INNOCENTLY AS A RESULT OF THATCOMMUNICATION NOT KNOWING THAT A NEW MOTIVE FOR THE LOAN MIGHT HAVEARISEN ON HIS BEING CALLED IN TO THIS MAN. AND AFTER ALL THE SUSPICIONOF BULSTRODES MOTIVES MIGHT BE UNJUST.BUT THEN CAME THE QUESTION WHETHER HE SHOULD HAVE ACTED IN PRECISELYTHE SAME WAY IF HE HAD NOT TAKEN THE MONEY CERTAINLY IF RAFFLES HADCONTINUED ALIVE AND SUSCEPTIBLE OF FURTHER TREATMENT WHEN HE ARRIVEDAND HE HAD THEN IMAGINED ANY DISOBEDIENCE TO HIS ORDERS ON THE PART OFBULSTRODE HE WOULD HAVE MADE A STRICT INQUIRY AND IF HIS CONJECTUREHAD BEEN VERIFIED HE WOULD HAVE THROWN UP THE CASE IN SPITE OF HISRECENT HEAVY OBLIGATION. BUT IF HE HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY MONEYIFBULSTRODE HAD NEVER REVOKED HIS COLD RECOMMENDATION OF BANKRUPTCYWOULDHE LYDGATE HAVE ABSTAINED FROM ALL INQUIRY EVEN ON FINDING THE MANDEADWOULD THE SHRINKING FROM AN INSULT TO BULSTRODEWOULD THEDUBIOUSNESS OF ALL MEDICAL TREATMENT AND THE ARGUMENT THAT HIS OWNTREATMENT WOULD PASS FOR THE WRONG WITH MOST MEMBERS OF HISPROFESSIONHAVE HAD JUST THE SAME FORCE OR SIGNIFICANCE WITH HIMTHAT WAS THE UNEASY CORNER OF LYDGATES CONSCIOUSNESS WHILE HE WASREVIEWING THE FACTS AND RESISTING ALL REPROACH. IF HE HAD BEENINDEPENDENT THIS MATTER OF A PATIENTS TREATMENT AND THE DISTINCT RULETHAT HE MUST DO OR SEE DONE THAT WHICH HE BELIEVED BEST FOR THE LIFECOMMITTED TO HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN THE POINT ON WHICH HE WOULD HAVE BEENTHE STURDIEST. AS IT WAS HE HAD RESTED IN THE CONSIDERATION THATDISOBEDIENCE TO HIS ORDERS HOWEVER IT MIGHT HAVE ARISEN COULD NOT BECONSIDERED A CRIME THAT IN THE DOMINANT OPINION OBEDIENCE TO HISORDERS WAS JUST AS LIKELY TO BE FATAL AND THAT THE AFFAIR WAS SIMPLYONE OF ETIQUETTE.

SCIENCE IS PROPERLY MORE SCRUPULOUS THAN DOGMA.DOGMA GIVES A CHARTER TO MISTAKE BUT THE VERY BREATH OF SCIENCE IS ACONTEST WITH MISTAKE AND MUST KEEP THE CONSCIENCE ALIVE. ALAS THESCIENTIFIC CONSCIENCE HAD GOT INTO THE DEBASING COMPANY OF MONEYOBLIGATION AND SELFISH RESPECTS.IS THERE A MEDICAL MAN OF THEM ALL IN MIDDLEMARCH WHO WOULD QUESTIONHIMSELF AS I DO SAID POOR LYDGATE WITH A RENEWED OUTBURST OFREBELLION AGAINST THE OPPRESSION OF HIS LOT. AND YET THEY WILL ALLFEEL WARRANTED IN MAKING A WIDE SPACE BETWEEN ME AND THEM AS IF I WEREA LEPER MY PRACTICE AND MY REPUTATION ARE UTTERLY DAMNEDI CAN SEETHAT. EVEN IF I COULD BE CLEARED BY VALID EVIDENCE IT WOULD MAKELITTLE DIFFERENCE TO THE BLESSED WORLD HERE. I HAVE BEEN SET DOWN ASTAINTED AND SHOULD BE CHEAPENED TO THEM ALL THE SAME.ALREADY THERE HAD BEEN ABUNDANT SIGNS WHICH HAD HITHERTO PUZZLED HIMTHAT JUST WHEN HE HAD BEEN PAYING OFF HIS DEBTS AND GETTING CHEERFULLYON HIS FEET THE TOWNSMEN WERE AVOIDING HIM OR LOOKING STRANGELY ATHIM AND IN TWO INSTANCES IT CAME TO HIS KNOWLEDGE THAT PATIENTS OF HISHAD CALLED IN ANOTHER PRACTITIONER. THE REASONS WERE TOO PLAIN NOW. THEGENERAL BLACKBALLING HAD BEGUN.NO WONDER THAT IN LYDGATES ENERGETIC NATURE THE SENSE OF A HOPELESSMISCONSTRUCTION EASILY TURNED INTO A DOGGED RESISTANCE. THE SCOWL WHICHOCCASIONALLY SHOWED ITSELF ON HIS SQUARE BROW WAS NOT A MEANINGLESSACCIDENT. ALREADY WHEN HE WAS REENTERING THE TOWN AFTER THAT RIDETAKEN IN THE FIRST HOURS OF STINGING PAIN HE WAS SETTING HIS MIND ONREMAINING IN MIDDLEMARCH IN SPITE OF THE WORST THAT COULD BE DONEAGAINST HIM. HE WOULD NOT RETREAT BEFORE CALUMNY AS IF HE SUBMITTED TOIT. HE WOULD FACE IT TO THE UTMOST AND NO ACT OF HIS SHOULD SHOW THATHE WAS AFRAID. IT BELONGED TO THE GENEROSITY AS WELL AS DEFIANT FORCEOF HIS NATURE THAT HE RESOLVED NOT TO SHRINK FROM SHOWING TO THE FULLHIS SENSE OF OBLIGATION TO BULSTRODE. IT WAS TRUE THAT THE ASSOCIATIONWITH THIS MAN HAD BEEN FATAL TO HIMTRUE THAT IF HE HAD HAD THETHOUSAND POUNDS STILL IN HIS HANDS WITH ALL HIS DEBTS UNPAID HE WOULDHAVE RETURNED THE MONEY TO BULSTRODE AND TAKEN BEGGARY RATHER THAN THERESCUE WHICH HAD BEEN SULLIED WITH THE SUSPICION OF A BRIBE FORREMEMBER HE WAS ONE OF THE PROUDEST AMONG THE SONS OFMENNEVERTHELESS HE WOULD NOT TURN AWAY FROM THIS CRUSHEDFELLOWMORTAL WHOSE AID HE HAD USED AND MAKE A PITIFUL EFFORT TO GETACQUITTAL FOR HIMSELF BY HOWLING AGAINST ANOTHER. I SHALL DO AS ITHINK RIGHT AND EXPLAIN TO NOBODY. THEY WILL TRY TO STARVE ME OUTBUT HE WAS GOING ON WITH AN OBSTINATE RESOLVE BUT HE WAS GETTINGNEAR HOME AND THE THOUGHT OF ROSAMOND URGED ITSELF AGAIN INTO THATCHIEF PLACE FROM WHICH IT HAD BEEN THRUST BY THE AGONIZED STRUGGLES OFWOUNDED HONOR AND PRIDE.HOW WOULD ROSAMOND TAKE IT ALL HERE WAS ANOTHER WEIGHT OF CHAIN TODRAG AND POOR LYDGATE WAS IN A BAD MOOD FOR BEARING HER DUMB MASTERY.HE HAD NO IMPULSE TO TELL HER THE TROUBLE WHICH MUST SOON BE COMMON TOTHEM BOTH. HE PREFERRED WAITING FOR THE INCIDENTAL DISCLOSURE WHICHEVENTS MUST SOON BRING ABOUT.CHAPTER LXXIV.MERCIFULLY GRANT THAT WE MAY GROW AGED TOGETHER.BOOK OF TOBIT MARRIAGE PRAYER.IN MIDDLEMARCH A WIFE COULD NOT LONG REMAIN IGNORANT THAT THE TOWN HELDA BAD OPINION OF HER HUSBAND. NO FEMININE INTIMATE MIGHT CARRY HERFRIENDSHIP SO FAR AS TO MAKE A PLAIN STATEMENT TO THE WIFE OF THEUNPLEASANT FACT KNOWN OR BELIEVED ABOUT HER HUSBAND BUT WHEN A WOMANWITH HER THOUGHTS MUCH AT LEISURE GOT THEM SUDDENLY EMPLOYED ONSOMETHING GRIEVOUSLY DISADVANTAGEOUS TO HER NEIGHBORS VARIOUS MORALIMPULSES WERE CALLED INTO PLAY WHICH TENDED TO STIMULATE UTTERANCE.CANDOR WAS ONE. TO BE CANDID IN MIDDLEMARCH PHRASEOLOGY MEANT TO USEAN EARLY OPPORTUNITY OF LETTING YOUR FRIENDS KNOW THAT YOU DID NOT TAKEA CHEERFUL VIEW OF THEIR CAPACITY THEIR CONDUCT OR THEIR POSITIONAND A ROBUST CANDOR NEVER WAITED TO BE ASKED FOR ITS OPINION. THENAGAIN THERE WAS THE LOVE OF TRUTHA WIDE PHRASE BUT MEANING IN THISRELATION A LIVELY OBJECTION TO SEEING A WIFE LOOK HAPPIER THAN HERHUSBANDS CHARACTER WARRANTED OR MANIFEST TOO MUCH SATISFACTION IN HERLOTTHE POOR THING SHOULD HAVE SOME HINT GIVEN HER THAT IF SHE KNEW THETRUTH SHE WOULD HAVE LESS COMPLACENCY IN HER BONNET AND IN LIGHTDISHES FOR A SUPPERPARTY. STRONGER THAN ALL THERE WAS THE REGARD FORA FRIENDS MORAL IMPROVEMENT SOMETIMES CALLED HER SOUL WHICH WASLIKELY TO BE BENEFITED BY REMARKS TENDING TO GLOOM UTTERED WITH THEACCOMPANIMENT OF PENSIVE STARING AT THE FURNITURE AND A MANNER IMPLYINGTHAT THE SPEAKER WOULD NOT TELL WHAT WAS ON HER MIND FROM REGARD TOTHE FEELINGS OF HER HEARER. ON THE WHOLE ONE MIGHT SAY THAT AN ARDENTCHARITY WAS AT WORK SETTING THE VIRTUOUS MIND TO MAKE A NEIGHBORUNHAPPY FOR HER GOOD.THERE WERE HARDLY ANY WIVES IN MIDDLEMARCH WHOSE MATRIMONIALMISFORTUNES WOULD IN DIFFERENT WAYS BE LIKELY TO CALL FORTH MORE OFTHIS MORAL ACTIVITY THAN ROSAMOND AND HER AUNT BULSTRODE. MRS.BULSTRODE WAS NOT AN OBJECT OF DISLIKE AND HAD NEVER CONSCIOUSLYINJURED ANY HUMAN BEING. MEN HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT HER A HANDSOMECOMFORTABLE WOMAN AND HAD RECKONED IT AMONG THE SIGNS OF BULSTRODESHYPOCRISY THAT HE HAD CHOSEN A REDBLOODED VINCY INSTEAD OF A GHASTLYAND MELANCHOLY PERSON SUITED TO HIS LOW ESTEEM FOR EARTHLY PLEASURE.WHEN THE SCANDAL ABOUT HER HUSBAND WAS DISCLOSED THEY REMARKED OFHERAH POOR WOMAN SHES AS HONEST AS THE DAYSHE NEVER SUSPECTEDANYTHING WRONG IN HIM YOU MAY DEPEND ON IT. WOMEN WHO WERE INTIMATEWITH HER TALKED TOGETHER MUCH OF POOR HARRIET IMAGINED WHAT HERFEELINGS MUST BE WHEN SHE CAME TO KNOW EVERYTHING AND CONJECTURED HOWMUCH SHE HAD ALREADY COME TO KNOW. THERE WAS NO SPITEFUL DISPOSITIONTOWARDS HER RATHER THERE WAS A BUSY BENEVOLENCE ANXIOUS TO ASCERTAINWHAT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR HER TO FEEL AND DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCESWHICH OF COURSE KEPT THE IMAGINATION OCCUPIED WITH HER CHARACTER ANDHISTORY FROM THE TIMES WHEN SHE WAS HARRIET VINCY TILL NOW. WITH THEREVIEW OF MRS. BULSTRODE AND HER POSITION IT WAS INEVITABLE TOASSOCIATE ROSAMOND WHOSE PROSPECTS WERE UNDER THE SAME BLIGHT WITH HERAUNTS. ROSAMOND WAS MORE SEVERELY CRITICISED AND LESS PITIED THOUGHSHE TOO AS ONE OF THE GOOD OLD VINCY FAMILY WHO HAD ALWAYS BEEN KNOWNIN MIDDLEMARCH WAS REGARDED AS A VICTIM TO MARRIAGE WITH ANINTERLOPER. THE VINCYS HAD THEIR WEAKNESSES BUT THEN THEY LAY ON THESURFACE THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING BAD TO BE FOUND OUT CONCERNINGTHEM. MRS. BULSTRODE WAS VINDICATED FROM ANY RESEMBLANCE TO HERHUSBAND. HARRIETS FAULTS WERE HER OWN.SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SHOWY SAID MRS. HACKBUTT MAKING TEA FOR A SMALLPARTY THOUGH SHE HAS GOT INTO THE WAY OF PUTTING HER RELIGIONFORWARD TO CONFORM TO HER HUSBAND SHE HAS TRIED TO HOLD HER HEAD UPABOVE MIDDLEMARCH BY MAKING IT KNOWN THAT SHE INVITES CLERGYMEN ANDHEAVENKNOWSWHO FROM RIVERSTON AND THOSE PLACES.WE CAN HARDLY BLAME HER FOR THAT SAID MRS. SPRAGUE BECAUSE FEW OFTHE BEST PEOPLE IN THE TOWN CARED TO ASSOCIATE WITH BULSTRODE AND SHEMUST HAVE SOMEBODY TO SIT DOWN AT HER TABLE.MR. THESIGER HAS ALWAYS COUNTENANCED HIM SAID MRS. HACKBUTT. ITHINK HE MUST BE SORRY NOW.BUT HE WAS NEVER FOND OF HIM IN HIS HEARTTHAT EVERY ONE KNOWS SAIDMRS. TOM TOLLER. MR. THESIGER NEVER GOES INTO EXTREMES. HE KEEPS TOTHE TRUTH IN WHAT IS EVANGELICAL. IT IS ONLY CLERGYMEN LIKE MR. TYKEWHO WANT TO USE DISSENTING HYMNBOOKS AND THAT LOW KIND OF RELIGIONWHO EVER FOUND BULSTRODE TO THEIR TASTE.I UNDERSTAND MR. TYKE IS IN GREAT DISTRESS ABOUT HIM SAID MRS.HACKBUTT. AND WELL HE MAY BE THEY SAY THE BULSTRODES HAVE HALF KEPTTHE TYKE FAMILY.AND OF COURSE IT IS A DISCREDIT TO HIS DOCTRINES SAID MRS. SPRAGUEWHO WAS ELDERLY AND OLDFASHIONED IN HER OPINIONS.PEOPLE WILL NOT MAKE A BOAST OF BEING METHODISTICAL IN MIDDLEMARCH FORA GOOD WHILE TO COME.I THINK WE MUST NOT SET DOWN PEOPLES BAD ACTIONS TO THEIR RELIGIONSAID FALCONFACED MRS. PLYMDALE WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING HITHERTO.OH MY DEAR WE ARE FORGETTING SAID MRS. SPRAGUE. WE OUGHT NOT TOBE TALKING OF THIS BEFORE YOU.I AM SURE I HAVE NO REASON TO BE PARTIAL SAID MRS. PLYMDALECOLORING. ITS TRUE MR. PLYMDALE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON GOOD TERMS WITHMR. BULSTRODE AND HARRIET VINCY WAS MY FRIEND LONG BEFORE SHE MARRIEDHIM. BUT I HAVE ALWAYS KEPT MY OWN OPINIONS AND TOLD HER WHERE SHE WASWRONG POOR THING. STILL IN POINT OF RELIGION I MUST SAY MR.BULSTRODE MIGHT HAVE DONE WHAT HE HAS AND WORSE AND YET HAVE BEEN AMAN OF NO RELIGION. I DONT SAY THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A LITTLE TOOMUCH OF THATI LIKE MODERATION MYSELF. BUT TRUTH IS TRUTH. THE MENTRIED AT THE ASSIZES ARE NOT ALL OVERRELIGIOUS I SUPPOSE.WELL SAID MRS. HACKBUTT WHEELING ADROITLY ALL I CAN SAY IS THATI THINK SHE OUGHT TO SEPARATE FROM HIM.I CANT SAY THAT SAID MRS. SPRAGUE. SHE TOOK HIM FOR BETTER ORWORSE YOU KNOW.BUT WORSE CAN NEVER MEAN FINDING OUT THAT YOUR HUSBAND IS FIT FORNEWGATE SAID MRS. HACKBUTT. FANCY LIVING WITH SUCH A MAN I SHOULDEXPECT TO BE POISONED.YES I THINK MYSELF IT IS AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO CRIME IF SUCH MEN ARE TOBE TAKEN CARE OF AND WAITED ON BY GOOD WIVES SAID MRS. TOM TOLLER.AND A GOOD WIFE POOR HARRIET HAS BEEN SAID MRS. PLYMDALE. SHETHINKS HER HUSBAND THE FIRST OF MEN. ITS TRUE HE HAS NEVER DENIED HERANYTHING.WELL WE SHALL SEE WHAT SHE WILL DO SAID MRS. HACKBUTT. I SUPPOSESHE KNOWS NOTHING YET POOR CREATURE. I DO HOPE AND TRUST I SHALL NOTSEE HER FOR I SHOULD BE FRIGHTENED TO DEATH LEST I SHOULD SAY ANYTHINGABOUT HER HUSBAND. DO YOU THINK ANY HINT HAS REACHED HERI SHOULD HARDLY THINK SO SAID MRS. TOM TOLLER. WE HEAR THAT HE ISILL AND HAS NEVER STIRRED OUT OF THE HOUSE SINCE THE MEETING ONTHURSDAY BUT SHE WAS WITH HER GIRLS AT CHURCH YESTERDAY AND THEY HADNEW TUSCAN BONNETS. HER OWN HAD A FEATHER IN IT. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THATHER RELIGION MADE ANY DIFFERENCE IN HER DRESS.SHE WEARS VERY NEAT PATTERNS ALWAYS SAID MRS. PLYMDALE A LITTLESTUNG. AND THAT FEATHER I KNOW SHE GOT DYED A PALE LAVENDER ON PURPOSETO BE CONSISTENT. I MUST SAY IT OF HARRIET THAT SHE WISHES TO DORIGHT.AS TO HER KNOWING WHAT HAS HAPPENED IT CANT BE KEPT FROM HER LONGSAID MRS. HACKBUTT. THE VINCYS KNOW FOR MR. VINCY WAS AT THE MEETING.IT WILL BE A GREAT BLOW TO HIM. THERE IS HIS DAUGHTER AS WELL AS HISSISTER.YES INDEED SAID MRS. SPRAGUE. NOBODY SUPPOSES THAT MR. LYDGATE CANGO ON HOLDING UP HIS HEAD IN MIDDLEMARCH THINGS LOOK SO BLACK ABOUTTHE THOUSAND POUNDS HE TOOK JUST AT THAT MANS DEATH. IT REALLY MAKESONE SHUDDER.PRIDE MUST HAVE A FALL SAID MRS. HACKBUTT.I AM NOT SO SORRY FOR ROSAMOND VINCY THAT WAS AS I AM FOR HER AUNTSAID MRS. PLYMDALE. SHE NEEDED A LESSON.I SUPPOSE THE BULSTRODES WILL GO AND LIVE ABROAD SOMEWHERE SAID MRS.SPRAGUE. THAT IS WHAT IS GENERALLY DONE WHEN THERE IS ANYTHINGDISGRACEFUL IN A FAMILY.AND A MOST DEADLY BLOW IT WILL BE TO HARRIET SAID MRS. PLYMDALE. IFEVER A WOMAN WAS CRUSHED SHE WILL BE. I PITY HER FROM MY HEART. ANDWITH ALL HER FAULTS FEW WOMEN ARE BETTER. FROM A GIRL SHE HAD THENEATEST WAYS AND WAS ALWAYS GOODHEARTED AND AS OPEN AS THE DAY. YOUMIGHT LOOK INTO HER DRAWERS WHEN YOU WOULDALWAYS THE SAME. AND SO SHEHAS BROUGHT UP KATE AND ELLEN. YOU MAY THINK HOW HARD IT WILL BE FORHER TO GO AMONG FOREIGNERS.THE DOCTOR SAYS THAT IS WHAT HE SHOULD RECOMMEND THE LYDGATES TO DOSAID MRS. SPRAGUE. HE SAYS LYDGATE OUGHT TO HAVE KEPT AMONG THEFRENCH.THAT WOULD SUIT HER WELL ENOUGH I DARE SAY SAID MRS. PLYMDALETHERE IS THAT KIND OF LIGHTNESS ABOUT HER. BUT SHE GOT THAT FROM HERMOTHER SHE NEVER GOT IT FROM HER AUNT BULSTRODE WHO ALWAYS GAVE HERGOOD ADVICE AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD HER MARRYELSEWHERE.MRS. PLYMDALE WAS IN A SITUATION WHICH CAUSED HER SOME COMPLICATION OFFEELING. THERE HAD BEEN NOT ONLY HER INTIMACY WITH MRS. BULSTRODE BUTALSO A PROFITABLE BUSINESS RELATION OF THE GREAT PLYMDALE DYEING HOUSEWITH MR. BULSTRODE WHICH ON THE ONE HAND WOULD HAVE INCLINED HER TODESIRE THAT THE MILDEST VIEW OF HIS CHARACTER SHOULD BE THE TRUE ONEBUT ON THE OTHER MADE HER THE MORE AFRAID OF SEEMING TO PALLIATE HISCULPABILITY. AGAIN THE LATE ALLIANCE OF HER FAMILY WITH THE TOLLERSHAD BROUGHT HER IN CONNECTION WITH THE BEST CIRCLE WHICH GRATIFIED HERIN EVERY DIRECTION EXCEPT IN THE INCLINATION TO THOSE SERIOUS VIEWSWHICH SHE BELIEVED TO BE THE BEST IN ANOTHER SENSE. THE SHARP LITTLEWOMANS CONSCIENCE WAS SOMEWHAT TROUBLED IN THE ADJUSTMENT OF THESEOPPOSING BESTS AND OF HER GRIEFS AND SATISFACTIONS UNDER LATEEVENTS WHICH WERE LIKELY TO HUMBLE THOSE WHO NEEDED HUMBLING BUT ALSOTO FALL HEAVILY ON HER OLD FRIEND WHOSE FAULTS SHE WOULD HAVE PREFERREDSEEING ON A BACKGROUND OF PROSPERITY.POOR MRS. BULSTRODE MEANWHILE HAD BEEN NO FURTHER SHAKEN BY THEONCOMING TREAD OF CALAMITY THAN IN THE BUSIER STIRRING OF THAT SECRETUNEASINESS WHICH HAD ALWAYS BEEN PRESENT IN HER SINCE THE LAST VISIT OFRAFFLES TO THE SHRUBS. THAT THE HATEFUL MAN HAD COME ILL TO STONECOURT AND THAT HER HUSBAND HAD CHOSEN TO REMAIN THERE AND WATCH OVERHIM SHE ALLOWED TO BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT RAFFLES HAD BEENEMPLOYED AND AIDED IN EARLIERDAYS AND THAT THIS MADE A TIE OFBENEVOLENCE TOWARDS HIM IN HIS DEGRADED HELPLESSNESS AND SHE HAD BEENSINCE THEN INNOCENTLY CHEERED BY HER HUSBANDS MORE HOPEFUL SPEECHABOUT HIS OWN HEALTH AND ABILITY TO CONTINUE HIS ATTENTION TO BUSINESS.THE CALM WAS DISTURBED WHEN LYDGATE HAD BROUGHT HIM HOME ILL FROM THEMEETING AND IN SPITE OF COMFORTING ASSURANCES DURING THE NEXT FEWDAYS SHE CRIED IN PRIVATE FROM THE CONVICTION THAT HER HUSBAND WAS NOTSUFFERING FROM BODILY ILLNESS MERELY BUT FROM SOMETHING THAT AFFLICTEDHIS MIND. HE WOULD NOT ALLOW HER TO READ TO HIM AND SCARCELY TO SITWITH HIM ALLEGING NERVOUS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SOUNDS AND MOVEMENTS YETSHE SUSPECTED THAT IN SHUTTING HIMSELF UP IN HIS PRIVATE ROOM HE WANTEDTO BE BUSY WITH HIS PAPERS. SOMETHING SHE FELT SURE HAD HAPPENED.PERHAPS IT WAS SOME GREAT LOSS OF MONEY AND SHE WAS KEPT IN THE DARK.NOT DARING TO QUESTION HER HUSBAND SHE SAID TO LYDGATE ON THE FIFTHDAY AFTER THE MEETING WHEN SHE HAD NOT LEFT HOME EXCEPT TO GO TOCHURCHMR. LYDGATE PRAY BE OPEN WITH ME I LIKE TO KNOW THE TRUTH. HASANYTHING HAPPENED TO MR. BULSTRODESOME LITTLE NERVOUS SHOCK SAID LYDGATE EVASIVELY. HE FELT THAT ITWAS NOT FOR HIM TO MAKE THE PAINFUL REVELATION.BUT WHAT BROUGHT IT ON SAID MRS. BULSTRODE LOOKING DIRECTLY AT HIMWITH HER LARGE DARK EYES.THERE IS OFTEN SOMETHING POISONOUS IN THE AIR OF PUBLIC ROOMS SAIDLYDGATE. STRONG MEN CAN STAND IT BUT IT TELLS ON PEOPLE IN PROPORTIONTO THE DELICACY OF THEIR SYSTEMS. IT IS OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCOUNT FORTHE PRECISE MOMENT OF AN ATTACKOR RATHER TO SAY WHY THE STRENGTHGIVES WAY AT A PARTICULAR MOMENT.MRS. BULSTRODE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS ANSWER. THERE REMAINED INHER THE BELIEF THAT SOME CALAMITY HAD BEFALLEN HER HUSBAND OF WHICHSHE WAS TO BE KEPT IN IGNORANCE AND IT WAS IN HER NATURE STRONGLY TOOBJECT TO SUCH CONCEALMENT. SHE BEGGED LEAVE FOR HER DAUGHTERS TO SITWITH THEIR FATHER AND DROVE INTO THE TOWN TO PAY SOME VISITSCONJECTURING THAT IF ANYTHING WERE KNOWN TO HAVE GONE WRONG IN MR.BULSTRODES AFFAIRS SHE SHOULD SEE OR HEAR SOME SIGN OF IT.SHE CALLED ON MRS. THESIGER WHO WAS NOT AT HOME AND THEN DROVE TOMRS. HACKBUTTS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHURCHYARD. MRS. HACKBUTT SAWHER COMING FROM AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW AND REMEMBERING HER FORMER ALARMLEST SHE SHOULD MEET MRS. BULSTRODE FELT ALMOST BOUND IN CONSISTENCYTO SEND WORD THAT SHE WAS NOT AT HOME BUT AGAINST THAT THERE WAS ASUDDEN STRONG DESIRE WITHIN HER FOR THE EXCITEMENT OF AN INTERVIEW INWHICH SHE WAS QUITE DETERMINED NOT TO MAKE THE SLIGHTEST ALLUSION TOWHAT WAS IN HER MIND.HENCE MRS. BULSTRODE WAS SHOWN INTO THE DRAWINGROOM AND MRS. HACKBUTTWENT TO HER WITH MORE TIGHTNESS OF LIP AND RUBBING OF HER HANDS THANWAS USUALLY OBSERVABLE IN HER THESE BEING PRECAUTIONS ADOPTED AGAINSTFREEDOM OF SPEECH. SHE WAS RESOLVED NOT TO ASK HOW MR. BULSTRODE WAS.I HAVE NOT BEEN ANYWHERE EXCEPT TO CHURCH FOR NEARLY A WEEK SAIDMRS. BULSTRODE AFTER A FEW INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. BUT MR. BULSTRODEWAS TAKEN SO ILL AT THE MEETING ON THURSDAY THAT I HAVE NOT LIKED TOLEAVE THE HOUSE.MRS. HACKBUTT RUBBED THE BACK OF ONE HAND WITH THE PALM OF THE OTHERHELD AGAINST HER CHEST AND LET HER EYES RAMBLE OVER THE PATTERN ON THERUG.WAS MR. HACKBUTT AT THE MEETING PERSEVERED MRS. BULSTRODE.YES HE WAS SAID MRS. HACKBUTT WITH THE SAME ATTITUDE. THE LAND ISTO BE BOUGHT BY SUBSCRIPTION I BELIEVE.LET US HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE NO MORE CASES OF CHOLERA TO BE BURIEDIN IT SAID MRS. BULSTRODE. IT IS AN AWFUL VISITATION. BUT I ALWAYSTHINK MIDDLEMARCH A VERY HEALTHY SPOT. I SUPPOSE IT IS BEING USED TO ITFROM A CHILD BUT I NEVER SAW THE TOWN I SHOULD LIKE TO LIVE AT BETTERAND ESPECIALLY OUR END.I AM SURE I SHOULD BE GLAD THAT YOU ALWAYS SHOULD LIVE AT MIDDLEMARCHMRS. BULSTRODE SAID MRS. HACKBUTT WITH A SLIGHT SIGH. STILL WEMUST LEARN TO RESIGN OURSELVES WHEREVER OUR LOT MAY BE CAST. THOUGH IAM SURE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN WHO WILL WISH YOUWELL.MRS. HACKBUTT LONGED TO SAY IF YOU TAKE MY ADVICE YOU WILL PART FROMYOUR HUSBAND BUT IT SEEMED CLEAR TO HER THAT THE POOR WOMAN KNEWNOTHING OF THE THUNDER READY TO BOLT ON HER HEAD AND SHE HERSELF COULDDO NO MORE THAN PREPARE HER A LITTLE. MRS. BULSTRODE FELT SUDDENLYRATHER CHILL AND TREMBLING THERE WAS EVIDENTLY SOMETHING UNUSUALBEHIND THIS SPEECH OF MRS. HACKBUTTS BUT THOUGH SHE HAD SET OUT WITHTHE DESIRE TO BE FULLY INFORMED SHE FOUND HERSELF UNABLE NOW TO PURSUEHER BRAVE PURPOSE AND TURNING THE CONVERSATION BY AN INQUIRY ABOUT THEYOUNG HACKBUTTS SHE SOON TOOK HER LEAVE SAYING THAT SHE WAS GOING TOSEE MRS. PLYMDALE. ON HER WAY THITHER SHE TRIED TO IMAGINE THAT THEREMIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME UNUSUALLY WARM SPARRING AT THE MEETING BETWEEN MR.BULSTRODE AND SOME OF HIS FREQUENT OPPONENTSPERHAPS MR. HACKBUTT MIGHTHAVE BEEN ONE OF THEM. THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR EVERYTHING.BUT WHEN SHE WAS IN CONVERSATION WITH MRS. PLYMDALE THAT COMFORTINGEXPLANATION SEEMED NO LONGER TENABLE. SELINA RECEIVED HER WITH APATHETIC AFFECTIONATENESS AND A DISPOSITION TO GIVE EDIFYING ANSWERS ONTHE COMMONEST TOPICS WHICH COULD HARDLY HAVE REFERENCE TO AN ORDINARYQUARREL OF WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCE WAS A PERTURBATION OFMR. BULSTRODES HEALTH. BEFOREHAND MRS. BULSTRODE HAD THOUGHT THAT SHEWOULD SOONER QUESTION MRS. PLYMDALE THAN ANY ONE ELSE BUT SHE FOUND TOHER SURPRISE THAT AN OLD FRIEND IS NOT ALWAYS THE PERSON WHOM IT ISEASIEST TO MAKE A CONFIDANT OF THERE WAS THE BARRIER OF REMEMBEREDCOMMUNICATION UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCESTHERE WAS THE DISLIKE OF BEINGPITIED AND INFORMED BY ONE WHO HAD BEEN LONG WONT TO ALLOW HER THESUPERIORITY. FOR CERTAIN WORDS OF MYSTERIOUS APPROPRIATENESS THAT MRS.PLYMDALE LET FALL ABOUT HER RESOLUTION NEVER TO TURN HER BACK ON HERFRIENDS CONVINCED MRS. BULSTRODE THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED MUST BE SOMEKIND OF MISFORTUNE AND INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO SAY WITH HER NATIVEDIRECTNESS WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR MIND SHE FOUND HERSELFANXIOUS TO GET AWAY BEFORE SHE HAD HEARD ANYTHING MORE EXPLICIT. SHEBEGAN TO HAVE AN AGITATING CERTAINTY THAT THE MISFORTUNE WAS SOMETHINGMORE THAN THE MERE LOSS OF MONEY BEING KEENLY SENSITIVE TO THE FACTTHAT SELINA NOW JUST AS MRS. HACKBUTT HAD DONE BEFORE AVOIDEDNOTICING WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT HER HUSBAND AS THEY WOULD HAVE AVOIDEDNOTICING A PERSONAL BLEMISH.SHE SAID GOODBY WITH NERVOUS HASTE AND TOLD THE COACHMAN TO DRIVE TOMR. VINCYS WAREHOUSE. IN THAT SHORT DRIVE HER DREAD GATHERED SO MUCHFORCE FROM THE SENSE OF DARKNESS THAT WHEN SHE ENTERED THE PRIVATECOUNTINGHOUSE WHERE HER BROTHER SAT AT HIS DESK HER KNEES TREMBLEDAND HER USUALLY FLORID FACE WAS DEATHLY PALE. SOMETHING OF THE SAMEEFFECT WAS PRODUCED IN HIM BY THE SIGHT OF HER HE ROSE FROM HIS SEATTO MEET HER TOOK HER BY THE HAND AND SAID WITH HIS IMPULSIVERASHNESSGOD HELP YOU HARRIET YOU KNOW ALL.THAT MOMENT WAS PERHAPS WORSE THAN ANY WHICH CAME AFTER. IT CONTAINEDTHAT CONCENTRATED EXPERIENCE WHICH IN GREAT CRISES OF EMOTION REVEALSTHE BIAS OF A NATURE AND IS PROPHETIC OF THE ULTIMATE ACT WHICH WILLEND AN INTERMEDIATE STRUGGLE. WITHOUT THAT MEMORY OF RAFFLES SHE MIGHTSTILL HAVE THOUGHT ONLY OF MONETARY RUIN BUT NOW ALONG WITH HERBROTHERS LOOK AND WORDS THERE DARTED INTO HER MIND THE IDEA OF SOMEGUILT IN HER HUSBANDTHEN UNDER THE WORKING OF TERROR CAME THE IMAGEOF HER HUSBAND EXPOSED TO DISGRACEAND THEN AFTER AN INSTANT OFSCORCHING SHAME IN WHICH SHE FELT ONLY THE EYES OF THE WORLD WITH ONELEAP OF HER HEART SHE WAS AT HIS SIDE IN MOURNFUL BUT UNREPROACHINGFELLOWSHIP WITH SHAME AND ISOLATION. ALL THIS WENT ON WITHIN HER IN AMERE FLASH OF TIMEWHILE SHE SANK INTO THE CHAIR AND RAISED HER EYESTO HER BROTHER WHO STOOD OVER HER. I KNOW NOTHING WALTER. WHAT ISIT SHE SAID FAINTLY.HE TOLD HER EVERYTHING VERY INARTIFICIALLY IN SLOW FRAGMENTS MAKINGHER AWARE THAT THE SCANDAL WENT MUCH BEYOND PROOF ESPECIALLY AS TO THEEND OF RAFFLES.PEOPLE WILL TALK HE SAID. EVEN IF A MAN HAS BEEN ACQUITTED BY AJURY THEYLL TALK AND NOD AND WINKAND AS FAR AS THE WORLD GOES AMAN MIGHT OFTEN AS WELL BE GUILTY AS NOT. ITS A BREAKDOWN BLOW AND ITDAMAGES LYDGATE AS MUCH AS BULSTRODE. I DONT PRETEND TO SAY WHAT ISTHE TRUTH. I ONLY WISH WE HAD NEVER HEARD THE NAME OF EITHER BULSTRODEOR LYDGATE. YOUD BETTER HAVE BEEN A VINCY ALL YOUR LIFE AND SO HADROSAMOND. MRS. BULSTRODE MADE NO REPLY.BUT YOU MUST BEAR UP AS WELL AS YOU CAN HARRIET. PEOPLE DONT BLAMEYOU. AND ILL STAND BY YOU WHATEVER YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO DOSAID THE BROTHER WITH ROUGH BUT WELLMEANING AFFECTIONATENESS.GIVE ME YOUR ARM TO THE CARRIAGE WALTER SAID MRS. BULSTRODE. IFEEL VERY WEAK.AND WHEN SHE GOT HOME SHE WAS OBLIGED TO SAY TO HER DAUGHTER I AM NOTWELL MY DEAR I MUST GO AND LIE DOWN. ATTEND TO YOUR PAPA. LEAVE ME INQUIET. I SHALL TAKE NO DINNER.SHE LOCKED HERSELF IN HER ROOM. SHE NEEDED TIME TO GET USED TO HERMAIMED CONSCIOUSNESS HER POOR LOPPED LIFE BEFORE SHE COULD WALKSTEADILY TO THE PLACE ALLOTTED HER. A NEW SEARCHING LIGHT HAD FALLEN ONHER HUSBANDS CHARACTER AND SHE COULD NOT JUDGE HIM LENIENTLY THETWENTY YEARS IN WHICH SHE HAD BELIEVED IN HIM AND VENERATED HIM BYVIRTUE OF HIS CONCEALMENTS CAME BACK WITH PARTICULARS THAT MADE THEMSEEM AN ODIOUS DECEIT. HE HAD MARRIED HER WITH THAT BAD PAST LIFEHIDDEN BEHIND HIM AND SHE HAD NO FAITH LEFT TO PROTEST HIS INNOCENCEOF THE WORST THAT WAS IMPUTED TO HIM. HER HONEST OSTENTATIOUS NATUREMADE THE SHARING OF A MERITED DISHONOR AS BITTER AS IT COULD BE TO ANYMORTAL.BUT THIS IMPERFECTLY TAUGHT WOMAN WHOSE PHRASES AND HABITS WERE AN ODDPATCHWORK HAD A LOYAL SPIRIT WITHIN HER. THE MAN WHOSE PROSPERITY SHEHAD SHARED THROUGH NEARLY HALF A LIFE AND WHO HAD UNVARYINGLYCHERISHED HERNOW THAT PUNISHMENT HAD BEFALLEN HIM IT WAS NOT POSSIBLETO HER IN ANY SENSE TO FORSAKE HIM. THERE IS A FORSAKING WHICH STILLSITS AT THE SAME BOARD AND LIES ON THE SAME COUCH WITH THE FORSAKENSOUL WITHERING IT THE MORE BY UNLOVING PROXIMITY. SHE KNEW WHEN SHELOCKED HER DOOR THAT SHE SHOULD UNLOCK IT READY TO GO DOWN TO HERUNHAPPY HUSBAND AND ESPOUSE HIS SORROW AND SAY OF HIS GUILT I WILLMOURN AND NOT REPROACH. BUT SHE NEEDED TIME TO GATHER UP HER STRENGTHSHE NEEDED TO SOB OUT HER FAREWELL TO ALL THE GLADNESS AND PRIDE OF HERLIFE. WHEN SHE HAD RESOLVED TO GO DOWN SHE PREPARED HERSELF BY SOMELITTLE ACTS WHICH MIGHT SEEM MERE FOLLY TO A HARD ONLOOKER THEY WEREHER WAY OF EXPRESSING TO ALL SPECTATORS VISIBLE OR INVISIBLE THAT SHEHAD BEGUN A NEW LIFE IN WHICH SHE EMBRACED HUMILIATION. SHE TOOK OFFALL HER ORNAMENTS AND PUT ON A PLAIN BLACK GOWN AND INSTEAD OF WEARINGHER MUCHADORNED CAP AND LARGE BOWS OF HAIR SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR DOWNAND PUT ON A PLAIN BONNETCAP WHICH MADE HER LOOK SUDDENLY LIKE ANEARLY METHODIST.BULSTRODE WHO KNEW THAT HIS WIFE HAD BEEN OUT AND HAD COME IN SAYINGTHAT SHE WAS NOT WELL HAD SPENT THE TIME IN AN AGITATION EQUAL TOHERS. HE HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO HER LEARNING THE TRUTH FROM OTHERS ANDHAD ACQUIESCED IN THAT PROBABILITY AS SOMETHING EASIER TO HIM THAN ANYCONFESSION. BUT NOW THAT HE IMAGINED THE MOMENT OF HER KNOWLEDGE COMEHE AWAITED THE RESULT IN ANGUISH. HIS DAUGHTERS HAD BEEN OBLIGED TOCONSENT TO LEAVE HIM AND THOUGH HE HAD ALLOWED SOME FOOD TO BE BROUGHTTO HIM HE HAD NOT TOUCHED IT. HE FELT HIMSELF PERISHING SLOWLY INUNPITIED MISERY. PERHAPS HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS WIFES FACE WITHAFFECTION IN IT AGAIN. AND IF HE TURNED TO GOD THERE SEEMED TO BE NOANSWER BUT THE PRESSURE OF RETRIBUTION.IT WAS EIGHT OCLOCK IN THE EVENING BEFORE THE DOOR OPENED AND HIS WIFEENTERED. HE DARED NOT LOOK UP AT HER. HE SAT WITH HIS EYES BENT DOWNAND AS SHE WENT TOWARDS HIM SHE THOUGHT HE LOOKED SMALLERHE SEEMED SOWITHERED AND SHRUNKEN. A MOVEMENT OF NEW COMPASSION AND OLD TENDERNESSWENT THROUGH HER LIKE A GREAT WAVE AND PUTTING ONE HAND ON HIS WHICHRESTED ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR AND THE OTHER ON HIS SHOULDER SHESAID SOLEMNLY BUT KINDLYLOOK UP NICHOLAS.HE RAISED HIS EYES WITH A LITTLE START AND LOOKED AT HER HALF AMAZEDFOR A MOMENT HER PALE FACE HER CHANGED MOURNING DRESS THE TREMBLINGABOUT HER MOUTH ALL SAID I KNOW AND HER HANDS AND EYES RESTEDGENTLY ON HIM. HE BURST OUT CRYING AND THEY CRIED TOGETHER SHE SITTINGAT HIS SIDE. THEY COULD NOT YET SPEAK TO EACH OTHER OF THE SHAME WHICHSHE WAS BEARING WITH HIM OR OF THE ACTS WHICH HAD BROUGHT IT DOWN ONTHEM. HIS CONFESSION WAS SILENT AND HER PROMISE OF FAITHFULNESS WASSILENT. OPENMINDED AS SHE WAS SHE NEVERTHELESS SHRANK FROM THE WORDSWHICH WOULD HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR MUTUAL CONSCIOUSNESS AS SHE WOULDHAVE SHRUNK FROM FLAKES OF FIRE. SHE COULD NOT SAY HOW MUCH IS ONLYSLANDER AND FALSE SUSPICION AND HE DID NOT SAY I AM INNOCENT.CHAPTER LXXV.LE SENTIMENT DE LA FAUSSET DES PLAISIRS PRSENTS ET LIGNORANCE DELA VANIT DES PLAISIRS ABSENTS CAUSENT LINCONSTANCE.PASCAL.ROSAMOND HAD A GLEAM OF RETURNING CHEERFULNESS WHEN THE HOUSE WAS FREEDFROM THE THREATENING FIGURE AND WHEN ALL THE DISAGREEABLE CREDITORSWERE PAID. BUT SHE WAS NOT JOYOUS HER MARRIED LIFE HAD FULFILLED NONEOF HER HOPES AND HAD BEEN QUITE SPOILED FOR HER IMAGINATION. IN THISBRIEF INTERVAL OF CALM LYDGATE REMEMBERING THAT HE HAD OFTEN BEENSTORMY IN HIS HOURS OF PERTURBATION AND MINDFUL OF THE PAIN ROSAMONDHAD HAD TO BEAR WAS CAREFULLY GENTLE TOWARDS HER BUT HE TOO HADLOST SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AND HE STILL FELT IT NECESSARY TO REFER TOAN ECONOMICAL CHANGE IN THEIR WAY OF LIVING AS A MATTER OF COURSETRYING TO RECONCILE HER TO IT GRADUALLY AND REPRESSING HIS ANGER WHENSHE ANSWERED BY WISHING THAT HE WOULD GO TO LIVE IN LONDON. WHEN SHEDID NOT MAKE THIS ANSWER SHE LISTENED LANGUIDLY AND WONDERED WHAT SHEHAD THAT WAS WORTH LIVING FOR. THE HARD AND CONTEMPTUOUS WORDS WHICHHAD FALLEN FROM HER HUSBAND IN HIS ANGER HAD DEEPLY OFFENDED THATVANITY WHICH HE HAD AT FIRST CALLED INTO ACTIVE ENJOYMENT AND WHAT SHEREGARDED AS HIS PERVERSE WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS KEPT UP A SECRETREPULSION WHICH MADE HER RECEIVE ALL HIS TENDERNESS AS A POORSUBSTITUTE FOR THE HAPPINESS HE HAD FAILED TO GIVE HER. THEY WERE AT ADISADVANTAGE WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS AND THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY OUTLOOKTOWARDS QUALLINGHAMTHERE WAS NO OUTLOOK ANYWHERE EXCEPT IN ANOCCASIONAL LETTER FROM WILL LADISLAW. SHE HAD FELT STUNG ANDDISAPPOINTED BY WILLS RESOLUTION TO QUIT MIDDLEMARCH FOR IN SPITE OFWHAT SHE KNEW AND GUESSED ABOUT HIS ADMIRATION FOR DOROTHEA SHESECRETLY CHERISHED THE BELIEF THAT HE HAD OR WOULD NECESSARILY COME TOHAVE MUCH MORE ADMIRATION FOR HERSELF ROSAMOND BEING ONE OF THOSEWOMEN WHO LIVE MUCH IN THE IDEA THAT EACH MAN THEY MEET WOULD HAVEPREFERRED THEM IF THE PREFERENCE HAD NOT BEEN HOPELESS. MRS. CASAUBONWAS ALL VERY WELL BUT WILLS INTEREST IN HER DATED BEFORE HE KNEW MRS.LYDGATE. ROSAMOND TOOK HIS WAY OF TALKING TO HERSELF WHICH WAS AMIXTURE OF PLAYFUL FAULTFINDING AND HYPERBOLICAL GALLANTRY AS THEDISGUISE OF A DEEPER FEELING AND IN HIS PRESENCE SHE FELT THATAGREEABLE TITILLATION OF VANITY AND SENSE OF ROMANTIC DRAMA WHICHLYDGATES PRESENCE HAD NO LONGER THE MAGIC TO CREATE. SHE EVENFANCIEDWHAT WILL NOT MEN AND WOMEN FANCY IN THESE MATTERSTHAT WILLEXAGGERATED HIS ADMIRATION FOR MRS. CASAUBON IN ORDER TO PIQUE HERSELF.IN THIS WAY POOR ROSAMONDS BRAIN HAD BEEN BUSY BEFORE WILLSDEPARTURE. HE WOULD HAVE MADE SHE THOUGHT A MUCH MORE SUITABLEHUSBAND FOR HER THAN SHE HAD FOUND IN LYDGATE. NO NOTION COULD HAVEBEEN FALSER THAN THIS FOR ROSAMONDS DISCONTENT IN HER MARRIAGE WASDUE TO THE CONDITIONS OF MARRIAGE ITSELF TO ITS DEMAND FORSELFSUPPRESSION AND TOLERANCE AND NOT TO THE NATURE OF HER HUSBANDBUT THE EASY CONCEPTION OF AN UNREAL BETTER HAD A SENTIMENTAL CHARMWHICH DIVERTED HER ENNUI. SHE CONSTRUCTED A LITTLE ROMANCE WHICH WAS TOVARY THE FLATNESS OF HER LIFE WILL LADISLAW WAS ALWAYS TO BE ABACHELOR AND LIVE NEAR HER ALWAYS TO BE AT HER COMMAND AND HAVE ANUNDERSTOOD THOUGH NEVER FULLY EXPRESSED PASSION FOR HER WHICH WOULD BESENDING OUT LAMBENT FLAMES EVERY NOW AND THEN IN INTERESTING SCENES.HIS DEPARTURE HAD BEEN A PROPORTIONATE DISAPPOINTMENT AND HAD SADLYINCREASED HER WEARINESS OF MIDDLEMARCH BUT AT FIRST SHE HAD THEALTERNATIVE DREAM OF PLEASURES IN STORE FROM HER INTERCOURSE WITH THEFAMILY AT QUALLINGHAM. SINCE THEN THE TROUBLES OF HER MARRIED LIFE HADDEEPENED AND THE ABSENCE OF OTHER RELIEF ENCOURAGED HER REGRETFULRUMINATION OVER THAT THIN ROMANCE WHICH SHE HAD ONCE FED ON. MEN ANDWOMEN MAKE SAD MISTAKES ABOUT THEIR OWN SYMPTOMS TAKING THEIR VAGUEUNEASY LONGINGS SOMETIMES FOR GENIUS SOMETIMES FOR RELIGION ANDOFTENER STILL FOR A MIGHTY LOVE. WILL LADISLAW HAD WRITTEN CHATTYLETTERS HALF TO HER AND HALF TO LYDGATE AND SHE HAD REPLIED THEIRSEPARATION SHE FELT WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE FINAL AND THE CHANGE SHENOW MOST LONGED FOR WAS THAT LYDGATE SHOULD GO TO LIVE IN LONDONEVERYTHING WOULD BE AGREEABLE IN LONDON AND SHE HAD SET TO WORK WITHQUIET DETERMINATION TO WIN THIS RESULT WHEN THERE CAME A SUDDENDELIGHTFUL PROMISE WHICH INSPIRITED HER.IT CAME SHORTLY BEFORE THE MEMORABLE MEETING AT THE TOWNHALL AND WASNOTHING LESS THAN A LETTER FROM WILL LADISLAW TO LYDGATE WHICH TURNEDINDEED CHIEFLY ON HIS NEW INTEREST IN PLANS OF COLONIZATION BUTMENTIONED INCIDENTALLY THAT HE MIGHT FIND IT NECESSARY TO PAY A VISITTO MIDDLEMARCH WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKSA VERY PLEASANT NECESSITY HESAID ALMOST AS GOOD AS HOLIDAYS TO A SCHOOLBOY. HE HOPED THERE WAS HISOLD PLACE ON THE RUG AND A GREAT DEAL OF MUSIC IN STORE FOR HIM. BUTHE WAS QUITE UNCERTAIN AS TO THE TIME. WHILE LYDGATE WAS READING THELETTER TO ROSAMOND HER FACE LOOKED LIKE A REVIVING FLOWERIT GREWPRETTIER AND MORE BLOOMING. THERE WAS NOTHING UNENDURABLE NOW THEDEBTS WERE PAID MR. LADISLAW WAS COMING AND LYDGATE WOULD BEPERSUADED TO LEAVE MIDDLEMARCH AND SETTLE IN LONDON WHICH WAS SODIFFERENT FROM A PROVINCIAL TOWN.THAT WAS A BRIGHT BIT OF MORNING. BUT SOON THE SKY BECAME BLACK OVERPOOR ROSAMOND. THE PRESENCE OF A NEW GLOOM IN HER HUSBAND ABOUT WHICHHE WAS ENTIRELY RESERVED TOWARDS HERFOR HE DREADED TO EXPOSE HISLACERATED FEELING TO HER NEUTRALITY AND MISCONCEPTIONSOON RECEIVED APAINFULLY STRANGE EXPLANATION ALIEN TO ALL HER PREVIOUS NOTIONS OFWHAT COULD AFFECT HER HAPPINESS. IN THE NEW GAYETY OF HER SPIRITSTHINKING THAT LYDGATE HAD MERELY A WORSE FIT OF MOODINESS THAN USUALCAUSING HIM TO LEAVE HER REMARKS UNANSWERED AND EVIDENTLY TO KEEP OUTOF HER WAY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SHE CHOSE A FEW DAYS AFTER THEMEETING AND WITHOUT SPEAKING TO HIM ON THE SUBJECT TO SEND OUT NOTESOF INVITATION FOR A SMALL EVENING PARTY FEELING CONVINCED THAT THISWAS A JUDICIOUS STEP SINCE PEOPLE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN KEEPING ALOOFFROM THEM AND WANTED RESTORING TO THE OLD HABIT OF INTERCOURSE. WHENTHE INVITATIONS HAD BEEN ACCEPTED SHE WOULD TELL LYDGATE AND GIVE HIMA WISE ADMONITION AS TO HOW A MEDICAL MAN SHOULD BEHAVE TO HISNEIGHBORS FOR ROSAMOND HAD THE GRAVEST LITTLE AIRS POSSIBLE ABOUTOTHER PEOPLES DUTIES. BUT ALL THE INVITATIONS WERE DECLINED AND THELAST ANSWER CAME INTO LYDGATES HANDS.THIS IS CHICHELYS SCRATCH. WHAT IS HE WRITING TO YOU ABOUT SAIDLYDGATE WONDERINGLY AS HE HANDED THE NOTE TO HER. SHE WAS OBLIGED TOLET HIM SEE IT AND LOOKING AT HER SEVERELY HE SAIDWHY ON EARTH HAVE YOU BEEN SENDING OUT INVITATIONS WITHOUT TELLING MEROSAMOND I BEG I INSIST THAT YOU WILL NOT INVITE ANY ONE TO THISHOUSE. I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE BEEN INVITING OTHERS AND THEY HAVE REFUSEDTOO. SHE SAID NOTHING.DO YOU HEAR ME THUNDERED LYDGATE.YES CERTAINLY I HEAR YOU SAID ROSAMOND TURNING HER HEAD ASIDE WITHTHE MOVEMENT OF A GRACEFUL LONGNECKED BIRD.LYDGATE TOSSED HIS HEAD WITHOUT ANY GRACE AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOMFEELING HIMSELF DANGEROUS. ROSAMONDS THOUGHT WAS THAT HE WAS GETTINGMORE AND MORE UNBEARABLENOT THAT THERE WAS ANY NEW SPECIAL REASON FORTHIS PEREMPTORINESS. HIS INDISPOSITION TO TELL HER ANYTHING IN WHICH HEWAS SURE BEFOREHAND THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE INTERESTED WAS GROWING INTOAN UNREFLECTING HABIT AND SHE WAS IN IGNORANCE OF EVERYTHING CONNECTEDWITH THE THOUSAND POUNDS EXCEPT THAT THE LOAN HAD COME FROM HER UNCLEBULSTRODE. LYDGATES ODIOUS HUMORS AND THEIR NEIGHBORS APPARENTAVOIDANCE OF THEM HAD AN UNACCOUNTABLE DATE FOR HER IN THEIR RELIEFFROM MONEY DIFFICULTIES. IF THE INVITATIONS HAD BEEN ACCEPTED SHE WOULDHAVE GONE TO INVITE HER MAMMA AND THE REST WHOM SHE HAD SEEN NOTHINGOF FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND SHE NOW PUT ON HER BONNET TO GO AND INQUIREWHAT HAD BECOME OF THEM ALL SUDDENLY FEELING AS IF THERE WERE ACONSPIRACY TO LEAVE HER IN ISOLATION WITH A HUSBAND DISPOSED TO OFFENDEVERYBODY. IT WAS AFTER THE DINNER HOUR AND SHE FOUND HER FATHER ANDMOTHER SEATED TOGETHER ALONE IN THE DRAWINGROOM. THEY GREETED HER WITHSAD LOOKS SAYING WELL MY DEAR AND NO MORE. SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HERFATHER LOOK SO DOWNCAST AND SEATING HERSELF NEAR HIM SHE SAIDIS THERE ANYTHING THE MATTER PAPAHE DID NOT ANSWER BUT MRS. VINCY SAID OH MY DEAR HAVE YOU HEARDNOTHING IT WONT BE LONG BEFORE IT REACHES YOU.IS IT ANYTHING ABOUT TERTIUS SAID ROSAMOND TURNING PALE. THE IDEAOF TROUBLE IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED ITSELF WITH WHAT HAD BEENUNACCOUNTABLE TO HER IN HIM.OH MY DEAR YES. TO THINK OF YOUR MARRYING INTO THIS TROUBLE. DEBTWAS BAD ENOUGH BUT THIS WILL BE WORSE.STAY STAY LUCY SAID MR. VINCY. HAVE YOU HEARD NOTHING ABOUT YOURUNCLE BULSTRODE ROSAMONDNO PAPA SAID THE POOR THING FEELING AS IF TROUBLE WERE NOTANYTHING SHE HAD BEFORE EXPERIENCED BUT SOME INVISIBLE POWER WITH ANIRON GRASP THAT MADE HER SOUL FAINT WITHIN HER.HER FATHER TOLD HER EVERYTHING SAYING AT THE END ITS BETTER FOR YOUTO KNOW MY DEAR. I THINK LYDGATE MUST LEAVE THE TOWN. THINGS HAVE GONEAGAINST HIM. I DARE SAY HE COULDNT HELP IT. I DONT ACCUSE HIM OF ANYHARM SAID MR. VINCY. HE HAD ALWAYS BEFORE BEEN DISPOSED TO FIND THEUTMOST FAULT WITH LYDGATE.THE SHOCK TO ROSAMOND WAS TERRIBLE. IT SEEMED TO HER THAT NO LOT COULDBE SO CRUELLY HARD AS HERS TO HAVE MARRIED A MAN WHO HAD BECOME THECENTRE OF INFAMOUS SUSPICIONS. IN MANY CASES IT IS INEVITABLE THAT THESHAME IS FELT TO BE THE WORST PART OF CRIME AND IT WOULD HAVE REQUIREDA GREAT DEAL OF DISENTANGLING REFLECTION SUCH AS HAD NEVER ENTEREDINTO ROSAMONDS LIFE FOR HER IN THESE MOMENTS TO FEEL THAT HER TROUBLEWAS LESS THAN IF HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN CERTAINLY KNOWN TO HAVE DONESOMETHING CRIMINAL. ALL THE SHAME SEEMED TO BE THERE. AND SHE HADINNOCENTLY MARRIED THIS MAN WITH THE BELIEF THAT HE AND HIS FAMILY WEREA GLORY TO HER SHE SHOWED HER USUAL RETICENCE TO HER PARENTS AND ONLYSAID THAT IF LYDGATE HAD DONE AS SHE WISHED HE WOULD HAVE LEFTMIDDLEMARCH LONG AGO.SHE BEARS IT BEYOND ANYTHING SAID HER MOTHER WHEN SHE WAS GONE.AH THANK GOD SAID MR. VINCY WHO WAS MUCH BROKEN DOWN.BUT ROSAMOND WENT HOME WITH A SENSE OF JUSTIFIED REPUGNANCE TOWARDS HERHUSBAND. WHAT HAD HE REALLY DONEHOW HAD HE REALLY ACTED SHE DID NOTKNOW. WHY HAD HE NOT TOLD HER EVERYTHING HE DID NOT SPEAK TO HER ONTHE SUBJECT AND OF COURSE SHE COULD NOT SPEAK TO HIM. IT CAME INTO HERMIND ONCE THAT SHE WOULD ASK HER FATHER TO LET HER GO HOME AGAIN BUTDWELLING ON THAT PROSPECT MADE IT SEEM UTTER DREARINESS TO HER AMARRIED WOMAN GONE BACK TO LIVE WITH HER PARENTSLIFE SEEMED TO HAVE NOMEANING FOR HER IN SUCH A POSITION SHE COULD NOT CONTEMPLATE HERSELFIN IT.THE NEXT TWO DAYS LYDGATE OBSERVED A CHANGE IN HER AND BELIEVED THATSHE HAD HEARD THE BAD NEWS. WOULD SHE SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT IT OR WOULDSHE GO ON FOREVER IN THE SILENCE WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT SHEBELIEVED HIM GUILTY WE MUST REMEMBER THAT HE WAS IN A MORBID STATE OFMIND IN WHICH ALMOST ALL CONTACT WAS PAIN. CERTAINLY ROSAMOND IN THISCASE HAD EQUAL REASON TO COMPLAIN OF RESERVE AND WANT OF CONFIDENCE ONHIS PART BUT IN THE BITTERNESS OF HIS SOUL HE EXCUSED HIMSELFWAS HENOT JUSTIFIED IN SHRINKING FROM THE TASK OF TELLING HER SINCE NOW SHEKNEW THE TRUTH SHE HAD NO IMPULSE TO SPEAK TO HIM BUT A DEEPERLYINGCONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE WAS IN FAULT MADE HIM RESTLESS AND THE SILENCEBETWEEN THEM BECAME INTOLERABLE TO HIM IT WAS AS IF THEY WERE BOTHADRIFT ON ONE PIECE OF WRECK AND LOOKED AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.HE THOUGHT I AM A FOOL. HAVENT I GIVEN UP EXPECTING ANYTHING I HAVEMARRIED CARE NOT HELP. AND THAT EVENING HE SAIDROSAMOND HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING THAT DISTRESSES YOUYES SHE ANSWERED LAYING DOWN HER WORK WHICH SHE HAD BEEN CARRYINGON WITH A LANGUID SEMICONSCIOUSNESS MOST UNLIKE HER USUAL SELF.WHAT HAVE YOU HEARDEVERYTHING I SUPPOSE. PAPA TOLD ME.THAT PEOPLE THINK ME DISGRACEDYES SAID ROSAMOND FAINTLY BEGINNING TO SEW AGAIN AUTOMATICALLY.THERE WAS SILENCE. LYDGATE THOUGHT IF SHE HAS ANY TRUST IN MEANYNOTION OF WHAT I AM SHE OUGHT TO SPEAK NOW AND SAY THAT SHE DOES NOTBELIEVE I HAVE DESERVED DISGRACE.BUT ROSAMOND ON HER SIDE WENT ON MOVING HER FINGERS LANGUIDLY. WHATEVERWAS TO BE SAID ON THE SUBJECT SHE EXPECTED TO COME FROM TERTIUS. WHATDID SHE KNOW AND IF HE WERE INNOCENT OF ANY WRONG WHY DID HE NOT DOSOMETHING TO CLEAR HIMSELFTHIS SILENCE OF HERS BROUGHT A NEW RUSH OF GALL TO THAT BITTER MOOD INWHICH LYDGATE HAD BEEN SAYING TO HIMSELF THAT NOBODY BELIEVED INHIMEVEN FAREBROTHER HAD NOT COME FORWARD. HE HAD BEGUN TO QUESTION HERWITH THE INTENT THAT THEIR CONVERSATION SHOULD DISPERSE THE CHILL FOGWHICH HAD GATHERED BETWEEN THEM BUT HE FELT HIS RESOLUTION CHECKED BYDESPAIRING RESENTMENT. EVEN THIS TROUBLE LIKE THE REST SHE SEEMED TOREGARD AS IF IT WERE HERS ALONE. HE WAS ALWAYS TO HER A BEING APARTDOING WHAT SHE OBJECTED TO. HE STARTED FROM HIS CHAIR WITH AN ANGRYIMPULSE AND THRUSTING HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS WALKED UP AND DOWN THEROOM. THERE WAS AN UNDERLYING CONSCIOUSNESS ALL THE WHILE THAT HESHOULD HAVE TO MASTER THIS ANGER AND TELL HER EVERYTHING AND CONVINCEHER OF THE FACTS. FOR HE HAD ALMOST LEARNED THE LESSON THAT HE MUSTBEND HIMSELF TO HER NATURE AND THAT BECAUSE SHE CAME SHORT IN HERSYMPATHY HE MUST GIVE THE MORE. SOON HE RECURRED TO HIS INTENTION OFOPENING HIMSELF THE OCCASION MUST NOT BE LOST. IF HE COULD BRING HERTO FEEL WITH SOME SOLEMNITY THAT HERE WAS A SLANDER WHICH MUST BE METAND NOT RUN AWAY FROM AND THAT THE WHOLE TROUBLE HAD COME OUT OF HISDESPERATE WANT OF MONEY IT WOULD BE A MOMENT FOR URGING POWERFULLY ONHER THAT THEY SHOULD BE ONE IN THE RESOLVE TO DO WITH AS LITTLE MONEYAS POSSIBLE SO THAT THEY MIGHT WEATHER THE BAD TIME AND KEEPTHEMSELVES INDEPENDENT. HE WOULD MENTION THE DEFINITE MEASURES WHICH HEDESIRED TO TAKE AND WIN HER TO A WILLING SPIRIT. HE WAS BOUND TO TRYTHISAND WHAT ELSE WAS THERE FOR HIM TO DOHE DID NOT KNOW HOW LONG HE HAD BEEN WALKING UNEASILY BACKWARDS ANDFORWARDS BUT ROSAMOND FELT THAT IT WAS LONG AND WISHED THAT HE WOULDSIT DOWN. SHE TOO HAD BEGUN TO THINK THIS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR URGING ONTERTIUS WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO. WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE TRUTH ABOUT ALL THISMISERY THERE WAS ONE DREAD WHICH ASSERTED ITSELF.LYDGATE AT LAST SEATED HIMSELF NOT IN HIS USUAL CHAIR BUT IN ONENEARER TO ROSAMOND LEANING ASIDE IN IT TOWARDS HER AND LOOKING AT HERGRAVELY BEFORE HE REOPENED THE SAD SUBJECT. HE HAD CONQUERED HIMSELF SOFAR AND WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WITH A SENSE OF SOLEMNITY AS ON ANOCCASION WHICH WAS NOT TO BE REPEATED. HE HAD EVEN OPENED HIS LIPSWHEN ROSAMOND LETTING HER HANDS FALL LOOKED AT HIM AND SAIDSURELY TERTIUSWELLSURELY NOW AT LAST YOU HAVE GIVEN UP THE IDEA OF STAYING INMIDDLEMARCH. I CANNOT GO ON LIVING HERE. LET US GO TO LONDON. PAPA ANDEVERY ONE ELSE SAYS YOU HAD BETTER GO. WHATEVER MISERY I HAVE TO PUTUP WITH IT WILL BE EASIER AWAY FROM HERE.LYDGATE FELT MISERABLY JARRED. INSTEAD OF THAT CRITICAL OUTPOURING FORWHICH HE HAD PREPARED HIMSELF WITH EFFORT HERE WAS THE OLD ROUND TO BEGONE THROUGH AGAIN. HE COULD NOT BEAR IT. WITH A QUICK CHANGE OFCOUNTENANCE HE ROSE AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM.PERHAPS IF HE HAD BEEN STRONG ENOUGH TO PERSIST IN HIS DETERMINATION TOBE THE MORE BECAUSE SHE WAS LESS THAT EVENING MIGHT HAVE HAD A BETTERISSUE. IF HIS ENERGY COULD HAVE BORNE DOWN THAT CHECK HE MIGHT STILLHAVE WROUGHT ON ROSAMONDS VISION AND WILL. WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT ANYNATURES HOWEVER INFLEXIBLE OR PECULIAR WILL RESIST THIS EFFECT FROM AMORE MASSIVE BEING THAN THEIR OWN. THEY MAY BE TAKEN BY STORM AND FORTHE MOMENT CONVERTED BECOMING PART OF THE SOUL WHICH ENWRAPS THEM INTHE ARDOR OF ITS MOVEMENT. BUT POOR LYDGATE HAD A THROBBING PAIN WITHINHIM AND HIS ENERGY HAD FALLEN SHORT OF ITS TASK.THE BEGINNING OF MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND RESOLVE SEEMED AS FAR OFF ASEVER NAY IT SEEMED BLOCKED OUT BY THE SENSE OF UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORT.THEY LIVED ON FROM DAY TO DAY WITH THEIR THOUGHTS STILL APART LYDGATEGOING ABOUT WHAT WORK HE HAD IN A MOOD OF DESPAIR AND ROSAMONDFEELING WITH SOME JUSTIFICATION THAT HE WAS BEHAVING CRUELLY. IT WASOF NO USE TO SAY ANYTHING TO TERTIUS BUT WHEN WILL LADISLAW CAME SHEWAS DETERMINED TO TELL HIM EVERYTHING. IN SPITE OF HER GENERALRETICENCE SHE NEEDED SOME ONE WHO WOULD RECOGNIZE HER WRONGS.CHAPTER LXXVI.TO MERCY PITY PEACE AND LOVE    ALL PRAY IN THEIR DISTRESSAND TO THESE VIRTUES OF DELIGHT    RETURN THEIR THANKFULNESS.. . . . . .FOR MERCY HAS A HUMAN HEART    PITY A HUMAN FACEAND LOVE THE HUMAN FORM DIVINE    AND PEACE THE HUMAN DRESS.WILLIAM BLAKE SONGS OF INNOCENCE.SOME DAYS LATER LYDGATE WAS RIDING TO LOWICK MANOR IN CONSEQUENCE OFA SUMMONS FROM DOROTHEA. THE SUMMONS HAD NOT BEEN UNEXPECTED SINCE ITHAD FOLLOWED A LETTER FROM MR. BULSTRODE IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HEHAD RESUMED HIS ARRANGEMENTS FOR QUITTING MIDDLEMARCH AND MUST REMINDLYDGATE OF HIS PREVIOUS COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT THE HOSPITAL TO THEPURPORT OF WHICH HE STILL ADHERED. IT HAD BEEN HIS DUTY BEFORE TAKINGFURTHER STEPS TO REOPEN THE SUBJECT WITH MRS. CASAUBON WHO NOWWISHED AS BEFORE TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION WITH LYDGATE. YOUR VIEWSMAY POSSIBLY HAVE UNDERGONE SOME CHANGE WROTE MR. BULSTRODE BUT INTHAT CASE ALSO IT IS DESIRABLE THAT YOU SHOULD LAY THEM BEFORE HER.DOROTHEA AWAITED HIS ARRIVAL WITH EAGER INTEREST. THOUGH IN DEFERENCETO HER MASCULINE ADVISERS SHE HAD REFRAINED FROM WHAT SIR JAMES HADCALLED INTERFERING IN THIS BULSTRODE BUSINESS THE HARDSHIP OFLYDGATES POSITION WAS CONTINUALLY IN HER MIND AND WHEN BULSTRODEAPPLIED TO HER AGAIN ABOUT THE HOSPITAL SHE FELT THAT THE OPPORTUNITYWAS COME TO HER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN HINDERED FROM HASTENING. IN HERLUXURIOUS HOME WANDERING UNDER THE BOUGHS OF HER OWN GREAT TREES HERTHOUGHT WAS GOING OUT OVER THE LOT OF OTHERS AND HER EMOTIONS WEREIMPRISONED. THE IDEA OF SOME ACTIVE GOOD WITHIN HER REACH HAUNTED HERLIKE A PASSION AND ANOTHERS NEED HAVING ONCE COME TO HER AS ADISTINCT IMAGE PREOCCUPIED HER DESIRE WITH THE YEARNING TO GIVERELIEF AND MADE HER OWN EASE TASTELESS. SHE WAS FULL OF CONFIDENT HOPEABOUT THIS INTERVIEW WITH LYDGATE NEVER HEEDING WHAT WAS SAID OF HISPERSONAL RESERVE NEVER HEEDING THAT SHE WAS A VERY YOUNG WOMAN.NOTHING COULD HAVE SEEMED MORE IRRELEVANT TO DOROTHEA THAN INSISTENCEON HER YOUTH AND SEX WHEN SHE WAS MOVED TO SHOW HER HUMAN FELLOWSHIP.AS SHE SAT WAITING IN THE LIBRARY SHE COULD DO NOTHING BUT LIVETHROUGH AGAIN ALL THE PAST SCENES WHICH HAD BROUGHT LYDGATE INTO HERMEMORIES. THEY ALL OWED THEIR SIGNIFICANCE TO HER MARRIAGE AND ITSTROUBLESBUT NO THERE WERE TWO OCCASIONS IN WHICH THE IMAGE OF LYDGATEHAD COME PAINFULLY IN CONNECTION WITH HIS WIFE AND SOME ONE ELSE. THEPAIN HAD BEEN ALLAYED FOR DOROTHEA BUT IT HAD LEFT IN HER AN AWAKENEDCONJECTURE AS TO WHAT LYDGATES MARRIAGE MIGHT BE TO HIM ASUSCEPTIBILITY TO THE SLIGHTEST HINT ABOUT MRS. LYDGATE. THESE THOUGHTSWERE LIKE A DRAMA TO HER AND MADE HER EYES BRIGHT AND GAVE ANATTITUDE OF SUSPENSE TO HER WHOLE FRAME THOUGH SHE WAS ONLY LOOKINGOUT FROM THE BROWN LIBRARY ON TO THE TURF AND THE BRIGHT GREEN BUDSWHICH STOOD IN RELIEF AGAINST THE DARK EVERGREENS.WHEN LYDGATE CAME IN SHE WAS ALMOST SHOCKED AT THE CHANGE IN HIS FACEWHICH WAS STRIKINGLY PERCEPTIBLE TO HER WHO HAD NOT SEEN HIM FOR TWOMONTHS. IT WAS NOT THE CHANGE OF EMACIATION BUT THAT EFFECT WHICH EVENYOUNG FACES WILL VERY SOON SHOW FROM THE PERSISTENT PRESENCE OFRESENTMENT AND DESPONDENCY. HER CORDIAL LOOK WHEN SHE PUT OUT HER HANDTO HIM SOFTENED HIS EXPRESSION BUT ONLY WITH MELANCHOLY.I HAVE WISHED VERY MUCH TO SEE YOU FOR A LONG WHILE MR. LYDGATESAID DOROTHEA WHEN THEY WERE SEATED OPPOSITE EACH OTHER BUT I PUT OFFASKING YOU TO COME UNTIL MR. BULSTRODE APPLIED TO ME AGAIN ABOUT THEHOSPITAL. I KNOW THAT THE ADVANTAGE OF KEEPING THE MANAGEMENT OF ITSEPARATE FROM THAT OF THE INFIRMARY DEPENDS ON YOU OR AT LEAST ONTHE GOOD WHICH YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO HOPE FOR FROM HAVING IT UNDER YOURCONTROL. AND I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT REFUSE TO TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT YOUTHINK.YOU WANT TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU SHOULD GIVE A GENEROUS SUPPORT TO THEHOSPITAL SAID LYDGATE. I CANNOT CONSCIENTIOUSLY ADVISE YOU TO DO ITIN DEPENDENCE ON ANY ACTIVITY OF MINE. I MAY BE OBLIGED TO LEAVE THETOWN.HE SPOKE CURTLY FEELING THE ACHE OF DESPAIR AS TO HIS BEING ABLE TOCARRY OUT ANY PURPOSE THAT ROSAMOND HAD SET HER MIND AGAINST.NOT BECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE TO BELIEVE IN YOU SAID DOROTHEA POURINGOUT HER WORDS IN CLEARNESS FROM A FULL HEART. I KNOW THE UNHAPPYMISTAKES ABOUT YOU. I KNEW THEM FROM THE FIRST MOMENT TO BE MISTAKES.YOU HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING VILE. YOU WOULD NOT DO ANYTHINGDISHONORABLE.IT WAS THE FIRST ASSURANCE OF BELIEF IN HIM THAT HAD FALLEN ONLYDGATES EARS. HE DREW A DEEP BREATH AND SAID THANK YOU. HE COULDSAY NO MORE IT WAS SOMETHING VERY NEW AND STRANGE IN HIS LIFE THATTHESE FEW WORDS OF TRUST FROM A WOMAN SHOULD BE SO MUCH TO HIM.I BESEECH YOU TO TELL ME HOW EVERYTHING WAS SAID DOROTHEAFEARLESSLY. I AM SURE THAT THE TRUTH WOULD CLEAR YOU.LYDGATE STARTED UP FROM HIS CHAIR AND WENT TOWARDS THE WINDOWFORGETTING WHERE HE WAS. HE HAD SO OFTEN GONE OVER IN HIS MIND THEPOSSIBILITY OF EXPLAINING EVERYTHING WITHOUT AGGRAVATING APPEARANCESTHAT WOULD TELL PERHAPS UNFAIRLY AGAINST BULSTRODE AND HAD SO OFTENDECIDED AGAINST ITHE HAD SO OFTEN SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HIS ASSERTIONSWOULD NOT CHANGE PEOPLES IMPRESSIONSTHAT DOROTHEAS WORDS SOUNDEDLIKE A TEMPTATION TO DO SOMETHING WHICH IN HIS SOBERNESS HE HADPRONOUNCED TO BE UNREASONABLE.TELL ME PRAY SAID DOROTHEA WITH SIMPLE EARNESTNESS THEN WE CANCONSULT TOGETHER. IT IS WICKED TO LET PEOPLE THINK EVIL OF ANY ONEFALSELY WHEN IT CAN BE HINDERED.LYDGATE TURNED REMEMBERING WHERE HE WAS AND SAW DOROTHEAS FACELOOKING UP AT HIM WITH A SWEET TRUSTFUL GRAVITY. THE PRESENCE OF ANOBLE NATURE GENEROUS IN ITS WISHES ARDENT IN ITS CHARITY CHANGESTHE LIGHTS FOR US WE BEGIN TO SEE THINGS AGAIN IN THEIR LARGERQUIETER MASSES AND TO BELIEVE THAT WE TOO CAN BE SEEN AND JUDGED INTHE WHOLENESS OF OUR CHARACTER. THAT INFLUENCE WAS BEGINNING TO ACT ONLYDGATE WHO HAD FOR MANY DAYS BEEN SEEING ALL LIFE AS ONE WHO ISDRAGGED AND STRUGGLING AMID THE THRONG. HE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND FELTTHAT HE WAS RECOVERING HIS OLD SELF IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE WASWITH ONE WHO BELIEVED IN IT.I DONT WANT HE SAID TO BEAR HARD ON BULSTRODE WHO HAS LENT MEMONEY OF WHICH I WAS IN NEEDTHOUGH I WOULD RATHER HAVE GONE WITHOUT ITNOW. HE IS HUNTED DOWN AND MISERABLE AND HAS ONLY A POOR THREAD OFLIFE IN HIM. BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING. IT WILL BE ACOMFORT TO ME TO SPEAK WHERE BELIEF HAS GONE BEFOREHAND AND WHERE ISHALL NOT SEEM TO BE OFFERING ASSERTIONS OF MY OWN HONESTY. YOU WILLFEEL WHAT IS FAIR TO ANOTHER AS YOU FEEL WHAT IS FAIR TO ME.DO TRUST ME SAID DOROTHEA I WILL NOT REPEAT ANYTHING WITHOUT YOURLEAVE. BUT AT THE VERY LEAST I COULD SAY THAT YOU HAVE MADE ALL THECIRCUMSTANCES CLEAR TO ME AND THAT I KNOW YOU ARE NOT IN ANY WAYGUILTY. MR. FAREBROTHER WOULD BELIEVE ME AND MY UNCLE AND SIR JAMESCHETTAM. NAY THERE ARE PERSONS IN MIDDLEMARCH TO WHOM I COULD GOALTHOUGH THEY DONT KNOW MUCH OF ME THEY WOULD BELIEVE ME. THEY WOULDKNOW THAT I COULD HAVE NO OTHER MOTIVE THAN TRUTH AND JUSTICE. I WOULDTAKE ANY PAINS TO CLEAR YOU. I HAVE VERY LITTLE TO DO. THERE IS NOTHINGBETTER THAT I CAN DO IN THE WORLD.DOROTHEAS VOICE AS SHE MADE THIS CHILDLIKE PICTURE OF WHAT SHE WOULDDO MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALMOST TAKEN AS A PROOF THAT SHE COULD DO ITEFFECTIVELY. THE SEARCHING TENDERNESS OF HER WOMANS TONES SEEMED MADEFOR A DEFENCE AGAINST READY ACCUSERS. LYDGATE DID NOT STAY TO THINKTHAT SHE WAS QUIXOTIC HE GAVE HIMSELF UP FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISLIFE TO THE EXQUISITE SENSE OF LEANING ENTIRELY ON A GENEROUSSYMPATHY WITHOUT ANY CHECK OF PROUD RESERVE. AND HE TOLD HEREVERYTHING FROM THE TIME WHEN UNDER THE PRESSURE OF HIS DIFFICULTIESHE UNWILLINGLY MADE HIS FIRST APPLICATION TO BULSTRODE GRADUALLY INTHE RELIEF OF SPEAKING GETTING INTO A MORE THOROUGH UTTERANCE OF WHATHAD GONE ON IN HIS MINDENTERING FULLY INTO THE FACT THAT HIS TREATMENTOF THE PATIENT WAS OPPOSED TO THE DOMINANT PRACTICE INTO HIS DOUBTS ATTHE LAST HIS IDEAL OF MEDICAL DUTY AND HIS UNEASY CONSCIOUSNESS THATTHE ACCEPTANCE OF THE MONEY HAD MADE SOME DIFFERENCE IN HIS PRIVATEINCLINATION AND PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR THOUGH NOT IN HIS FULFILMENT OFANY PUBLICLY RECOGNIZED OBLIGATION.IT HAS COME TO MY KNOWLEDGE SINCE HE ADDED THAT HAWLEY SENT SOMEONE TO EXAMINE THE HOUSEKEEPER AT STONE COURT AND SHE SAID THAT SHEGAVE THE PATIENT ALL THE OPIUM IN THE PHIAL I LEFT AS WELL AS A GOODDEAL OF BRANDY. BUT THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO ORDINARYPRESCRIPTIONS EVEN OF FIRSTRATE MEN. THE SUSPICIONS AGAINST ME HAD NOHOLD THERE THEY ARE GROUNDED ON THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I TOOK MONEY THATBULSTRODE HAD STRONG MOTIVES FOR WISHING THE MAN TO DIE AND THAT HEGAVE ME THE MONEY AS A BRIBE TO CONCUR IN SOME MALPRACTICES OR OTHERAGAINST THE PATIENTTHAT IN ANY CASE I ACCEPTED A BRIBE TO HOLD MYTONGUE. THEY ARE JUST THE SUSPICIONS THAT CLING THE MOST OBSTINATELYBECAUSE THEY LIE IN PEOPLES INCLINATION AND CAN NEVER BE DISPROVED.HOW MY ORDERS CAME TO BE DISOBEYED IS A QUESTION TO WHICH I DONT KNOWTHE ANSWER. IT IS STILL POSSIBLE THAT BULSTRODE WAS INNOCENT OF ANYCRIMINAL INTENTIONEVEN POSSIBLE THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEDISOBEDIENCE AND MERELY ABSTAINED FROM MENTIONING IT. BUT ALL THAT HASNOTHING TO DO WITH THE PUBLIC BELIEF. IT IS ONE OF THOSE CASES ON WHICHA MAN IS CONDEMNED ON THE GROUND OF HIS CHARACTERIT IS BELIEVED THATHE HAS COMMITTED A CRIME IN SOME UNDEFINED WAY BECAUSE HE HAD THEMOTIVE FOR DOING IT AND BULSTRODES CHARACTER HAS ENVELOPED MEBECAUSE I TOOK HIS MONEY. I AM SIMPLY BLIGHTEDLIKE A DAMAGED EAR OFCORNTHE BUSINESS IS DONE AND CANT BE UNDONE.OH IT IS HARD SAID DOROTHEA. I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTY THERE ISIN YOUR VINDICATING YOURSELF. AND THAT ALL THIS SHOULD HAVE COME TO YOUWHO HAD MEANT TO LEAD A HIGHER LIFE THAN THE COMMON AND TO FIND OUTBETTER WAYSI CANNOT BEAR TO REST IN THIS AS UNCHANGEABLE. I KNOW YOUMEANT THAT. I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME WHEN YOU FIRST SPOKE TO MEABOUT THE HOSPITAL. THERE IS NO SORROW I HAVE THOUGHT MORE ABOUT THANTHATTO LOVE WHAT IS GREAT AND TRY TO REACH IT AND YET TO FAIL.YES SAID LYDGATE FEELING THAT HERE HE HAD FOUND ROOM FOR THE FULLMEANING OF HIS GRIEF. I HAD SOME AMBITION. I MEANT EVERYTHING TO BEDIFFERENT WITH ME. I THOUGHT I HAD MORE STRENGTH AND MASTERY. BUT THEMOST TERRIBLE OBSTACLES ARE SUCH AS NOBODY CAN SEE EXCEPT ONESELF.SUPPOSE SAID DOROTHEA MEDITATIVELYSUPPOSE WE KEPT ON THEHOSPITAL ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT PLAN AND YOU STAYED HERE THOUGH ONLYWITH THE FRIENDSHIP AND SUPPORT OF A FEW THE EVIL FEELING TOWARDS YOUWOULD GRADUALLY DIE OUT THERE WOULD COME OPPORTUNITIES IN WHICH PEOPLEWOULD BE FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAD BEEN UNJUST TO YOUBECAUSE THEY WOULD SEE THAT YOUR PURPOSES WERE PURE. YOU MAY STILL WINA GREAT FAME LIKE THE LOUIS AND LAENNEC I HAVE HEARD YOU SPEAK OF ANDWE SHALL ALL BE PROUD OF YOU SHE ENDED WITH A SMILE.THAT MIGHT DO IF I HAD MY OLD TRUST IN MYSELF SAID LYDGATEMOURNFULLY. NOTHING GALLS ME MORE THAN THE NOTION OF TURNING ROUND ANDRUNNING AWAY BEFORE THIS SLANDER LEAVING IT UNCHECKED BEHIND ME.STILL I CANT ASK ANY ONE TO PUT A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY INTO A PLANWHICH DEPENDS ON ME.IT WOULD BE QUITE WORTH MY WHILE SAID DOROTHEA SIMPLY. ONLY THINK.I AM VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH MY MONEY BECAUSE THEY TELL ME I HAVE TOOLITTLE FOR ANY GREAT SCHEME OF THE SORT I LIKE BEST AND YET I HAVE TOOMUCH. I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED AYEAR OF MY OWNFORTUNE AND NINETEEN HUNDRED AYEAR THAT MR. CASAUBON LEFT ME ANDBETWEEN THREE AND FOUR THOUSAND OF READY MONEY IN THE BANK. I WISHED TORAISE MONEY AND PAY IT OFF GRADUALLY OUT OF MY INCOME WHICH I DONTWANT TO BUY LAND WITH AND FOUND A VILLAGE WHICH SHOULD BE A SCHOOL OFINDUSTRY BUT SIR JAMES AND MY UNCLE HAVE CONVINCED ME THAT THE RISKWOULD BE TOO GREAT. SO YOU SEE THAT WHAT I SHOULD MOST REJOICE AT WOULDBE TO HAVE SOMETHING GOOD TO DO WITH MY MONEY I SHOULD LIKE IT TO MAKEOTHER PEOPLES LIVES BETTER TO THEM. IT MAKES ME VERY UNEASYCOMING ALLTO ME WHO DONT WANT IT.A SMILE BROKE THROUGH THE GLOOM OF LYDGATES FACE. THE CHILDLIKEGRAVEEYED EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH DOROTHEA SAID ALL THIS WASIRRESISTIBLEBLENT INTO AN ADORABLE WHOLE WITH HER READY UNDERSTANDINGOF HIGH EXPERIENCE. OF LOWER EXPERIENCE SUCH AS PLAYS A GREAT PART INTHE WORLD POOR MRS. CASAUBON HAD A VERY BLURRED SHORTSIGHTEDKNOWLEDGE LITTLE HELPED BY HER IMAGINATION. BUT SHE TOOK THE SMILE ASENCOURAGEMENT OF HER PLAN.I THINK YOU SEE NOW THAT YOU SPOKE TOO SCRUPULOUSLY SHE SAID IN ATONE OF PERSUASION. THE HOSPITAL WOULD BE ONE GOOD AND MAKING YOURLIFE QUITE WHOLE AND WELL AGAIN WOULD BE ANOTHER.LYDGATES SMILE HAD DIED AWAY. YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS AS WELL AS THEMONEY TO DO ALL THAT IF IT COULD BE DONE HE SAID. BUTHE HESITATED A LITTLE WHILE LOOKING VAGUELY TOWARDS THE WINDOW ANDSHE SAT IN SILENT EXPECTATION. AT LAST HE TURNED TOWARDS HER AND SAIDIMPETUOUSLYWHY SHOULD I NOT TELL YOUYOU KNOW WHAT SORT OF BOND MARRIAGE IS. YOUWILL UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING.DOROTHEA FELT HER HEART BEGINNING TO BEAT FASTER. HAD HE THAT SORROWTOO BUT SHE FEARED TO SAY ANY WORD AND HE WENT ON IMMEDIATELY.IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME NOW TO DO ANYTHINGTO TAKE ANY STEP WITHOUTCONSIDERING MY WIFES HAPPINESS. THE THING THAT I MIGHT LIKE TO DO IF IWERE ALONE IS BECOME IMPOSSIBLE TO ME. I CANT SEE HER MISERABLE. SHEMARRIED ME WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT SHE WAS GOING INTO AND IT MIGHT HAVEBEEN BETTER FOR HER IF SHE HAD NOT MARRIED ME.I KNOW I KNOWYOU COULD NOT GIVE HER PAIN IF YOU WERE NOT OBLIGED TODO IT SAID DOROTHEA WITH KEEN MEMORY OF HER OWN LIFE.AND SHE HAS SET HER MIND AGAINST STAYING. SHE WISHES TO GO. THETROUBLES SHE HAS HAD HERE HAVE WEARIED HER SAID LYDGATE BREAKING OFFAGAIN LEST HE SHOULD SAY TOO MUCH.BUT WHEN SHE SAW THE GOOD THAT MIGHT COME OF STAYING SAID DOROTHEAREMONSTRANTLY LOOKING AT LYDGATE AS IF HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE REASONSWHICH HAD JUST BEEN CONSIDERED. HE DID NOT SPEAK IMMEDIATELY.SHE WOULD NOT SEE IT HE SAID AT LAST CURTLY FEELING AT FIRST THATTHIS STATEMENT MUST DO WITHOUT EXPLANATION. AND INDEED I HAVE LOSTALL SPIRIT ABOUT CARRYING ON MY LIFE HERE. HE PAUSED A MOMENT ANDTHEN FOLLOWING THE IMPULSE TO LET DOROTHEA SEE DEEPER INTO THEDIFFICULTY OF HIS LIFE HE SAID THE FACT IS THIS TROUBLE HAS COMEUPON HER CONFUSEDLY. WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK TO EACH OTHER ABOUTIT. I AM NOT SURE WHAT IS IN HER MIND ABOUT IT SHE MAY FEAR THAT IHAVE REALLY DONE SOMETHING BASE. IT IS MY FAULT I OUGHT TO BE MOREOPEN. BUT I HAVE BEEN SUFFERING CRUELLY.MAY I GO AND SEE HER SAID DOROTHEA EAGERLY. WOULD SHE ACCEPT MYSYMPATHY I WOULD TELL HER THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN BLAMABLE BEFORE ANYONES JUDGMENT BUT YOUR OWN. I WOULD TELL HER THAT YOU SHALL BE CLEAREDIN EVERY FAIR MIND. I WOULD CHEER HER HEART. WILL YOU ASK HER IF I MAYGO TO SEE HER I DID SEE HER ONCE.I AM SURE YOU MAY SAID LYDGATE SEIZING THE PROPOSITION WITH SOMEHOPE. SHE WOULD FEEL HONOREDCHEERED I THINK BY THE PROOF THAT YOUAT LEAST HAVE SOME RESPECT FOR ME. I WILL NOT SPEAK TO HER ABOUT YOURCOMINGTHAT SHE MAY NOT CONNECT IT WITH MY WISHES AT ALL. I KNOW VERYWELL THAT I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE LEFT ANYTHING TO BE TOLD HER BY OTHERSBUTHE BROKE OFF AND THERE WAS A MOMENTS SILENCE. DOROTHEA REFRAINED FROMSAYING WHAT WAS IN HER MINDHOW WELL SHE KNEW THAT THERE MIGHT BEINVISIBLE BARRIERS TO SPEECH BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE. THIS WAS A POINTON WHICH EVEN SYMPATHY MIGHT MAKE A WOUND. SHE RETURNED TO THE MOREOUTWARD ASPECT OF LYDGATES POSITION SAYING CHEERFULLYAND IF MRS. LYDGATE KNEW THAT THERE WERE FRIENDS WHO WOULD BELIEVE INYOU AND SUPPORT YOU SHE MIGHT THEN BE GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD STAY INYOUR PLACE AND RECOVER YOUR HOPESAND DO WHAT YOU MEANT TO DO. PERHAPSTHEN YOU WOULD SEE THAT IT WAS RIGHT TO AGREE WITH WHAT I PROPOSEDABOUT YOUR CONTINUING AT THE HOSPITAL. SURELY YOU WOULD IF YOU STILLHAVE FAITH IN IT AS A MEANS OF MAKING YOUR KNOWLEDGE USEFULLYDGATE DID NOT ANSWER AND SHE SAW THAT HE WAS DEBATING WITH HIMSELF.YOU NEED NOT DECIDE IMMEDIATELY SHE SAID GENTLY. A FEW DAYS HENCEIT WILL BE EARLY ENOUGH FOR ME TO SEND MY ANSWER TO MR. BULSTRODE.LYDGATE STILL WAITED BUT AT LAST TURNED TO SPEAK IN HIS MOST DECISIVETONES.NO I PREFER THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO INTERVAL LEFT FOR WAVERING. I AMNO LONGER SURE ENOUGH OF MYSELFI MEAN OF WHAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FORME TO DO UNDER THE CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY LIFE. IT WOULD BEDISHONORABLE TO LET OTHERS ENGAGE THEMSELVES TO ANYTHING SERIOUS INDEPENDENCE ON ME. I MIGHT BE OBLIGED TO GO AWAY AFTER ALL I SEE LITTLECHANCE OF ANYTHING ELSE. THE WHOLE THING IS TOO PROBLEMATIC I CANNOTCONSENT TO BE THE CAUSE OF YOUR GOODNESS BEING WASTED. NOLET THE NEWHOSPITAL BE JOINED WITH THE OLD INFIRMARY AND EVERYTHING GO ON AS ITMIGHT HAVE DONE IF I HAD NEVER COME. I HAVE KEPT A VALUABLE REGISTERSINCE I HAVE BEEN THERE I SHALL SEND IT TO A MAN WHO WILL MAKE USE OFIT HE ENDED BITTERLY. I CAN THINK OF NOTHING FOR A LONG WHILE BUTGETTING AN INCOME.IT HURTS ME VERY MUCH TO HEAR YOU SPEAK SO HOPELESSLY SAID DOROTHEA.IT WOULD BE A HAPPINESS TO YOUR FRIENDS WHO BELIEVE IN YOUR FUTUREIN YOUR POWER TO DO GREAT THINGS IF YOU WOULD LET THEM SAVE YOU FROMTHAT. THINK HOW MUCH MONEY I HAVE IT WOULD BE LIKE TAKING A BURTHENFROM ME IF YOU TOOK SOME OF IT EVERY YEAR TILL YOU GOT FREE FROM THISFETTERING WANT OF INCOME. WHY SHOULD NOT PEOPLE DO THESE THINGS IT ISSO DIFFICULT TO MAKE SHARES AT ALL EVEN. THIS IS ONE WAY.GOD BLESS YOU MRS. CASAUBON SAID LYDGATE RISING AS IF WITH THESAME IMPULSE THAT MADE HIS WORDS ENERGETIC AND RESTING HIS ARM ON THEBACK OF THE GREAT LEATHER CHAIR HE HAD BEEN SITTING IN. IT IS GOODTHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE SUCH FEELINGS. BUT I AM NOT THE MAN WHO OUGHT TOALLOW HIMSELF TO BENEFIT BY THEM. I HAVE NOT GIVEN GUARANTEES ENOUGH. IMUST NOT AT LEAST SINK INTO THE DEGRADATION OF BEING PENSIONED FOR WORKTHAT I NEVER ACHIEVED. IT IS VERY CLEAR TO ME THAT I MUST NOT COUNT ONANYTHING ELSE THAN GETTING AWAY FROM MIDDLEMARCH AS SOON AS I CANMANAGE IT. I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE FOR A LONG WHILE AT THE VERY BEST TOGET AN INCOME HERE ANDAND IT IS EASIER TO MAKE NECESSARY CHANGES IN ANEW PLACE. I MUST DO AS OTHER MEN DO AND THINK WHAT WILL PLEASE THEWORLD AND BRING IN MONEY LOOK FOR A LITTLE OPENING IN THE LONDONCROWD AND PUSH MYSELF SET UP IN A WATERINGPLACE OR GO TO SOMESOUTHERN TOWN WHERE THERE ARE PLENTY OF IDLE ENGLISH AND GET MYSELFPUFFEDTHAT IS THE SORT OF SHELL I MUST CREEP INTO AND TRY TO KEEP MYSOUL ALIVE IN.NOW THAT IS NOT BRAVE SAID DOROTHEATO GIVE UP THE FIGHT.NO IT IS NOT BRAVE SAID LYDGATE BUT IF A MAN IS AFRAID OFCREEPING PARALYSIS THEN IN ANOTHER TONE YET YOU HAVE MADE A GREATDIFFERENCE IN MY COURAGE BY BELIEVING IN ME. EVERYTHING SEEMS MOREBEARABLE SINCE I HAVE TALKED TO YOU AND IF YOU CAN CLEAR ME IN A FEWOTHER MINDS ESPECIALLY IN FAREBROTHERS I SHALL BE DEEPLY GRATEFUL.THE POINT I WISH YOU NOT TO MENTION IS THE FACT OF DISOBEDIENCE TO MYORDERS. THAT WOULD SOON GET DISTORTED. AFTER ALL THERE IS NO EVIDENCEFOR ME BUT PEOPLES OPINION OF ME BEFOREHAND. YOU CAN ONLY REPEAT MYOWN REPORT OF MYSELF.MR. FAREBROTHER WILL BELIEVEOTHERS WILL BELIEVE SAID DOROTHEA. ICAN SAY OF YOU WHAT WILL MAKE IT STUPIDITY TO SUPPOSE THAT YOU WOULD BEBRIBED TO DO A WICKEDNESS.I DONT KNOW SAID LYDGATE WITH SOMETHING LIKE A GROAN IN HIS VOICE.I HAVE NOT TAKEN A BRIBE YET. BUT THERE IS A PALE SHADE OF BRIBERYWHICH IS SOMETIMES CALLED PROSPERITY. YOU WILL DO ME ANOTHER GREATKINDNESS THEN AND COME TO SEE MY WIFEYES I WILL. I REMEMBER HOW PRETTY SHE IS SAID DOROTHEA INTO WHOSEMIND EVERY IMPRESSION ABOUT ROSAMOND HAD CUT DEEP. I HOPE SHE WILLLIKE ME.AS LYDGATE RODE AWAY HE THOUGHT THIS YOUNG CREATURE HAS A HEARTLARGE ENOUGH FOR THE VIRGIN MARY. SHE EVIDENTLY THINKS NOTHING OF HEROWN FUTURE AND WOULD PLEDGE AWAY HALF HER INCOME AT ONCE AS IF SHEWANTED NOTHING FOR HERSELF BUT A CHAIR TO SIT IN FROM WHICH SHE CANLOOK DOWN WITH THOSE CLEAR EYES AT THE POOR MORTALS WHO PRAY TO HER.SHE SEEMS TO HAVE WHAT I NEVER SAW IN ANY WOMAN BEFOREA FOUNTAIN OFFRIENDSHIP TOWARDS MENA MAN CAN MAKE A FRIEND OF HER. CASAUBON MUSTHAVE RAISED SOME HEROIC HALLUCINATION IN HER. I WONDER IF SHE COULDHAVE ANY OTHER SORT OF PASSION FOR A MAN LADISLAWTHERE WAS CERTAINLYAN UNUSUAL FEELING BETWEEN THEM. AND CASAUBON MUST HAVE HAD A NOTION OFIT. WELLHER LOVE MIGHT HELP A MAN MORE THAN HER MONEY.DOROTHEA ON HER SIDE HAD IMMEDIATELY FORMED A PLAN OF RELIEVING LYDGATEFROM HIS OBLIGATION TO BULSTRODE WHICH SHE FELT SURE WAS A PARTTHOUGH SMALL OF THE GALLING PRESSURE HE HAD TO BEAR. SHE SAT DOWN ATONCE UNDER THE INSPIRATION OF THEIR INTERVIEW AND WROTE A BRIEF NOTEIN WHICH SHE PLEADED THAT SHE HAD MORE CLAIM THAN MR. BULSTRODE HAD TOTHE SATISFACTION OF PROVIDING THE MONEY WHICH HAD BEEN SERVICEABLE TOLYDGATETHAT IT WOULD BE UNKIND IN LYDGATE NOT TO GRANT HER THEPOSITION OF BEING HIS HELPER IN THIS SMALL MATTER THE FAVOR BEINGENTIRELY TO HER WHO HAD SO LITTLE THAT WAS PLAINLY MARKED OUT FOR HERTO DO WITH HER SUPERFLUOUS MONEY. HE MIGHT CALL HER A CREDITOR OR BYANY OTHER NAME IF IT DID BUT IMPLY THAT HE GRANTED HER REQUEST. SHEENCLOSED A CHECK FOR A THOUSAND POUNDS AND DETERMINED TO TAKE THELETTER WITH HER THE NEXT DAY WHEN SHE WENT TO SEE ROSAMOND.CHAPTER LXXVII.AND THUS THY FALL HATH LEFT A KIND OF BLOTTO MARK THE FULLFRAUGHT MAN AND BEST INDUEDWITH SOME SUSPICION.HENRY V.THE NEXT DAY LYDGATE HAD TO GO TO BRASSING AND TOLD ROSAMOND THAT HESHOULD BE AWAY UNTIL THE EVENING. OF LATE SHE HAD NEVER GONE BEYOND HEROWN HOUSE AND GARDEN EXCEPT TO CHURCH AND ONCE TO SEE HER PAPA TOWHOM SHE SAID IF TERTIUS GOES AWAY YOU WILL HELP US TO MOVE WILLYOU NOT PAPA I SUPPOSE WE SHALL HAVE VERY LITTLE MONEY. I AM SURE IHOPE SOME ONE WILL HELP US. AND MR. VINCY HAD SAID YES CHILD IDONT MIND A HUNDRED OR TWO. I CAN SEE THE END OF THAT. WITH THESEEXCEPTIONS SHE HAD SAT AT HOME IN LANGUID MELANCHOLY AND SUSPENSEFIXING HER MIND ON WILL LADISLAWS COMING AS THE ONE POINT OF HOPE ANDINTEREST AND ASSOCIATING THIS WITH SOME NEW URGENCY ON LYDGATE TO MAKEIMMEDIATE ARRANGEMENTS FOR LEAVING MIDDLEMARCH AND GOING TO LONDONTILL SHE FELT ASSURED THAT THE COMING WOULD BE A POTENT CAUSE OF THEGOING WITHOUT AT ALL SEEING HOW. THIS WAY OF ESTABLISHING SEQUENCES ISTOO COMMON TO BE FAIRLY REGARDED AS A PECULIAR FOLLY IN ROSAMOND. ANDIT IS PRECISELY THIS SORT OF SEQUENCE WHICH CAUSES THE GREATEST SHOCKWHEN IT IS SUNDERED FOR TO SEE HOW AN EFFECT MAY BE PRODUCED IS OFTENTO SEE POSSIBLE MISSINGS AND CHECKS BUT TO SEE NOTHING EXCEPT THEDESIRABLE CAUSE AND CLOSE UPON IT THE DESIRABLE EFFECT RIDS US OFDOUBT AND MAKES OUR MINDS STRONGLY INTUITIVE. THAT WAS THE PROCESSGOING ON IN POOR ROSAMOND WHILE SHE ARRANGED ALL OBJECTS AROUND HERWITH THE SAME NICETY AS EVER ONLY WITH MORE SLOWNESSOR SAT DOWN TOTHE PIANO MEANING TO PLAY AND THEN DESISTING YET LINGERING ON THEMUSIC STOOL WITH HER WHITE FINGERS SUSPENDED ON THE WOODEN FRONT ANDLOOKING BEFORE HER IN DREAMY ENNUI. HER MELANCHOLY HAD BECOME SO MARKEDTHAT LYDGATE FELT A STRANGE TIMIDITY BEFORE IT AS A PERPETUAL SILENTREPROACH AND THE STRONG MAN MASTERED BY HIS KEEN SENSIBILITIESTOWARDS THIS FAIR FRAGILE CREATURE WHOSE LIFE HE SEEMED SOMEHOW TO HAVEBRUISED SHRANK FROM HER LOOK AND SOMETIMES STARTED AT HER APPROACHFEAR OF HER AND FEAR FOR HER RUSHING IN ONLY THE MORE FORCIBLY AFTER ITHAD BEEN MOMENTARILY EXPELLED BY EXASPERATION.BUT THIS MORNING ROSAMOND DESCENDED FROM HER ROOM UPSTAIRSWHERE SHESOMETIMES SAT THE WHOLE DAY WHEN LYDGATE WAS OUTEQUIPPED FOR A WALK INTHE TOWN. SHE HAD A LETTER TO POSTA LETTER ADDRESSED TO MR. LADISLAWAND WRITTEN WITH CHARMING DISCRETION BUT INTENDED TO HASTEN HISARRIVAL BY A HINT OF TROUBLE. THE SERVANTMAID THEIR SOLEHOUSESERVANT NOW NOTICED HER COMING DOWNSTAIRS IN HER WALKING DRESSAND THOUGHT THERE NEVER DID ANYBODY LOOK SO PRETTY IN A BONNET POORTHING.MEANWHILE DOROTHEAS MIND WAS FILLED WITH HER PROJECT OF GOING TOROSAMOND AND WITH THE MANY THOUGHTS BOTH OF THE PAST AND THE PROBABLEFUTURE WHICH GATHERED ROUND THE IDEA OF THAT VISIT. UNTIL YESTERDAYWHEN LYDGATE HAD OPENED TO HER A GLIMPSE OF SOME TROUBLE IN HIS MARRIEDLIFE THE IMAGE OF MRS. LYDGATE HAD ALWAYS BEEN ASSOCIATED FOR HER WITHTHAT OF WILL LADISLAW. EVEN IN HER MOST UNEASY MOMENTSEVEN WHEN SHEHAD BEEN AGITATED BY MRS. CADWALLADERS PAINFULLY GRAPHIC REPORT OFGOSSIPHER EFFORT NAY HER STRONGEST IMPULSIVE PROMPTING HAD BEENTOWARDS THE VINDICATION OF WILL FROM ANY SULLYING SURMISES AND WHENIN HER MEETING WITH HIM AFTERWARDS SHE HAD AT FIRST INTERPRETED HISWORDS AS A PROBABLE ALLUSION TO A FEELING TOWARDS MRS. LYDGATE WHICH HEWAS DETERMINED TO CUT HIMSELF OFF FROM INDULGING SHE HAD HAD A QUICKSAD EXCUSING VISION OF THE CHARM THERE MIGHT BE IN HIS CONSTANTOPPORTUNITIES OF COMPANIONSHIP WITH THAT FAIR CREATURE WHO MOST LIKELYSHARED HIS OTHER TASTES AS SHE EVIDENTLY DID HIS DELIGHT IN MUSIC. BUTTHERE HAD FOLLOWED HIS PARTING WORDSTHE FEW PASSIONATE WORDS IN WHICHHE HAD IMPLIED THAT SHE HERSELF WAS THE OBJECT OF WHOM HIS LOVE HELDHIM IN DREAD THAT IT WAS HIS LOVE FOR HER ONLY WHICH HE WAS RESOLVEDNOT TO DECLARE BUT TO CARRY AWAY INTO BANISHMENT. FROM THE TIME OF THATPARTING DOROTHEA BELIEVING IN WILLS LOVE FOR HER BELIEVING WITH APROUD DELIGHT IN HIS DELICATE SENSE OF HONOR AND HIS DETERMINATION THATNO ONE SHOULD IMPEACH HIM JUSTLY FELT HER HEART QUITE AT REST AS TOTHE REGARD HE MIGHT HAVE FOR MRS. LYDGATE. SHE WAS SURE THAT THE REGARDWAS BLAMELESS.THERE ARE NATURES IN WHICH IF THEY LOVE US WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF HAVINGA SORT OF BAPTISM AND CONSECRATION THEY BIND US OVER TO RECTITUDE ANDPURITY BY THEIR PURE BELIEF ABOUT US AND OUR SINS BECOME THAT WORSTKIND OF SACRILEGE WHICH TEARS DOWN THE INVISIBLE ALTAR OF TRUST. IFYOU ARE NOT GOOD NONE IS GOODTHOSE LITTLE WORDS MAY GIVE A TERRIFICMEANING TO RESPONSIBILITY MAY HOLD A VITRIOLIC INTENSITY FOR REMORSE.DOROTHEAS NATURE WAS OF THAT KIND HER OWN PASSIONATE FAULTS LAY ALONGTHE EASILY COUNTED OPEN CHANNELS OF HER ARDENT CHARACTER AND WHILE SHEWAS FULL OF PITY FOR THE VISIBLE MISTAKES OF OTHERS SHE HAD NOT YETANY MATERIAL WITHIN HER EXPERIENCE FOR SUBTLE CONSTRUCTIONS ANDSUSPICIONS OF HIDDEN WRONG. BUT THAT SIMPLICITY OF HERS HOLDING UP ANIDEAL FOR OTHERS IN HER BELIEVING CONCEPTION OF THEM WAS ONE OF THEGREAT POWERS OF HER WOMANHOOD. AND IT HAD FROM THE FIRST ACTED STRONGLYON WILL LADISLAW. HE FELT WHEN HE PARTED FROM HER THAT THE BRIEFWORDS BY WHICH HE HAD TRIED TO CONVEY TO HER HIS FEELING ABOUT HERSELFAND THE DIVISION WHICH HER FORTUNE MADE BETWEEN THEM WOULD ONLY PROFITBY THEIR BREVITY WHEN DOROTHEA HAD TO INTERPRET THEM HE FELT THAT INHER MIND HE HAD FOUND HIS HIGHEST ESTIMATE.AND HE WAS RIGHT THERE. IN THE MONTHS SINCE THEIR PARTING DOROTHEA HADFELT A DELICIOUS THOUGH SAD REPOSE IN THEIR RELATION TO EACH OTHER ASONE WHICH WAS INWARDLY WHOLE AND WITHOUT BLEMISH. SHE HAD AN ACTIVEFORCE OF ANTAGONISM WITHIN HER WHEN THE ANTAGONISM TURNED ON THEDEFENCE EITHER OF PLANS OR PERSONS THAT SHE BELIEVED IN AND THE WRONGSWHICH SHE FELT THAT WILL HAD RECEIVED FROM HER HUSBAND AND THEEXTERNAL CONDITIONS WHICH TO OTHERS WERE GROUNDS FOR SLIGHTING HIMONLY GAVE THE MORE TENACITY TO HER AFFECTION AND ADMIRING JUDGMENT. ANDNOW WITH THE DISCLOSURES ABOUT BULSTRODE HAD COME ANOTHER FACTAFFECTING WILLS SOCIAL POSITION WHICH ROUSED AFRESH DOROTHEAS INWARDRESISTANCE TO WHAT WAS SAID ABOUT HIM IN THAT PART OF HER WORLD WHICHLAY WITHIN PARK PALINGS.YOUNG LADISLAW THE GRANDSON OF A THIEVING JEW PAWNBROKER WAS A PHRASEWHICH HAD ENTERED EMPHATICALLY INTO THE DIALOGUES ABOUT THE BULSTRODEBUSINESS AT LOWICK TIPTON AND FRESHITT AND WAS A WORSE KIND OFPLACARD ON POOR WILLS BACK THAN THE ITALIAN WITH WHITE MICE. UPRIGHTSIR JAMES CHETTAM WAS CONVINCED THAT HIS OWN SATISFACTION WAS RIGHTEOUSWHEN HE THOUGHT WITH SOME COMPLACENCY THAT HERE WAS AN ADDED LEAGUE TOTHAT MOUNTAINOUS DISTANCE BETWEEN LADISLAW AND DOROTHEA WHICH ENABLEDHIM TO DISMISS ANY ANXIETY IN THAT DIRECTION AS TOO ABSURD. AND PERHAPSTHERE HAD BEEN SOME PLEASURE IN POINTING MR. BROOKES ATTENTION TO THISUGLY BIT OF LADISLAWS GENEALOGY AS A FRESH CANDLE FOR HIM TO SEE HISOWN FOLLY BY. DOROTHEA HAD OBSERVED THE ANIMUS WITH WHICH WILLS PARTIN THE PAINFUL STORY HAD BEEN RECALLED MORE THAN ONCE BUT SHE HADUTTERED NO WORD BEING CHECKED NOW AS SHE HAD NOT BEEN FORMERLY INSPEAKING OF WILL BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A DEEPER RELATION BETWEENTHEM WHICH MUST ALWAYS REMAIN IN CONSECRATED SECRECY. BUT HER SILENCESHROUDED HER RESISTANT EMOTION INTO A MORE THOROUGH GLOW AND THISMISFORTUNE IN WILLS LOT WHICH IT SEEMED OTHERS WERE WISHING TO FLINGAT HIS BACK AS AN OPPROBRIUM ONLY GAVE SOMETHING MORE OF ENTHUSIASM TOHER CLINGING THOUGHT.SHE ENTERTAINED NO VISIONS OF THEIR EVER COMING INTO NEARER UNION ANDYET SHE HAD TAKEN NO POSTURE OF RENUNCIATION. SHE HAD ACCEPTED HERWHOLE RELATION TO WILL VERY SIMPLY AS PART OF HER MARRIAGE SORROWS ANDWOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT VERY SINFUL IN HER TO KEEP UP AN INWARD WAILBECAUSE SHE WAS NOT COMPLETELY HAPPY BEING RATHER DISPOSED TO DWELL ONTHE SUPERFLUITIES OF HER LOT. SHE COULD BEAR THAT THE CHIEF PLEASURESOF HER TENDERNESS SHOULD LIE IN MEMORY AND THE IDEA OF MARRIAGE CAMETO HER SOLELY AS A REPULSIVE PROPOSITION FROM SOME SUITOR OF WHOM SHEAT PRESENT KNEW NOTHING BUT WHOSE MERITS AS SEEN BY HER FRIENDSWOULD BE A SOURCE OF TORMENT TO HERSOMEBODY WHO WILL MANAGE YOURPROPERTY FOR YOU MY DEAR WAS MR. BROOKES ATTRACTIVE SUGGESTION OFSUITABLE CHARACTERISTICS. I SHOULD LIKE TO MANAGE IT MYSELF IF I KNEWWHAT TO DO WITH IT SAID DOROTHEA. NOSHE ADHERED TO HER DECLARATIONTHAT SHE WOULD NEVER BE MARRIED AGAIN AND IN THE LONG VALLEY OF HERLIFE WHICH LOOKED SO FLAT AND EMPTY OF WAYMARKS GUIDANCE WOULD COME ASSHE WALKED ALONG THE ROAD AND SAW HER FELLOWPASSENGERS BY THE WAY.THIS HABITUAL STATE OF FEELING ABOUT WILL LADISLAW HAD BEEN STRONG INALL HER WAKING HOURS SINCE SHE HAD PROPOSED TO PAY A VISIT TO MRS.LYDGATE MAKING A SORT OF BACKGROUND AGAINST WHICH SHE SAW ROSAMONDSFIGURE PRESENTED TO HER WITHOUT HINDRANCES TO HER INTEREST ANDCOMPASSION. THERE WAS EVIDENTLY SOME MENTAL SEPARATION SOME BARRIER TOCOMPLETE CONFIDENCE WHICH HAD ARISEN BETWEEN THIS WIFE AND THE HUSBANDWHO HAD YET MADE HER HAPPINESS A LAW TO HIM. THAT WAS A TROUBLE WHICHNO THIRD PERSON MUST DIRECTLY TOUCH. BUT DOROTHEA THOUGHT WITH DEEPPITY OF THE LONELINESS WHICH MUST HAVE COME UPON ROSAMOND FROM THESUSPICIONS CAST ON HER HUSBAND AND THERE WOULD SURELY BE HELP IN THEMANIFESTATION OF RESPECT FOR LYDGATE AND SYMPATHY WITH HER.I SHALL TALK TO HER ABOUT HER HUSBAND THOUGHT DOROTHEA AS SHE WASBEING DRIVEN TOWARDS THE TOWN. THE CLEAR SPRING MORNING THE SCENT OFTHE MOIST EARTH THE FRESH LEAVES JUST SHOWING THEIR CREASEDUP WEALTHOF GREENERY FROM OUT THEIR HALFOPENED SHEATHS SEEMED PART OF THECHEERFULNESS SHE WAS FEELING FROM A LONG CONVERSATION WITH MR.FAREBROTHER WHO HAD JOYFULLY ACCEPTED THE JUSTIFYING EXPLANATION OFLYDGATES CONDUCT. I SHALL TAKE MRS. LYDGATE GOOD NEWS AND PERHAPSSHE WILL LIKE TO TALK TO ME AND MAKE A FRIEND OF ME.DOROTHEA HAD ANOTHER ERRAND IN LOWICK GATE IT WAS ABOUT A NEWFINETONED BELL FOR THE SCHOOLHOUSE AND AS SHE HAD TO GET OUT OF HERCARRIAGE VERY NEAR TO LYDGATES SHE WALKED THITHER ACROSS THE STREETHAVING TOLD THE COACHMAN TO WAIT FOR SOME PACKAGES. THE STREET DOOR WASOPEN AND THE SERVANT WAS TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY OF LOOKING OUT AT THECARRIAGE WHICH WAS PAUSING WITHIN SIGHT WHEN IT BECAME APPARENT TO HERTHAT THE LADY WHO BELONGED TO IT WAS COMING TOWARDS HER.IS MRS. LYDGATE AT HOME SAID DOROTHEA.IM NOT SURE MY LADY ILL SEE IF YOULL PLEASE TO WALK IN SAIDMARTHA A LITTLE CONFUSED ON THE SCORE OF HER KITCHEN APRON BUTCOLLECTED ENOUGH TO BE SURE THAT MUM WAS NOT THE RIGHT TITLE FOR THISQUEENLY YOUNG WIDOW WITH A CARRIAGE AND PAIR. WILL YOU PLEASE TO WALKIN AND ILL GO AND SEE.SAY THAT I AM MRS. CASAUBON SAID DOROTHEA AS MARTHA MOVED FORWARDINTENDING TO SHOW HER INTO THE DRAWINGROOM AND THEN TO GO UPSTAIRS TOSEE IF ROSAMOND HAD RETURNED FROM HER WALK.THEY CROSSED THE BROADER PART OF THE ENTRANCEHALL AND TURNED UP THEPASSAGE WHICH LED TO THE GARDEN. THE DRAWINGROOM DOOR WAS UNLATCHEDAND MARTHA PUSHING IT WITHOUT LOOKING INTO THE ROOM WAITED FOR MRS.CASAUBON TO ENTER AND THEN TURNED AWAY THE DOOR HAVING SWUNG OPEN ANDSWUNG BACK AGAIN WITHOUT NOISE.DOROTHEA HAD LESS OF OUTWARD VISION THAN USUAL THIS MORNING BEINGFILLED WITH IMAGES OF THINGS AS THEY HAD BEEN AND WERE GOING TO BE. SHEFOUND HERSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR WITHOUT SEEING ANYTHINGREMARKABLE BUT IMMEDIATELY SHE HEARD A VOICE SPEAKING IN LOW TONESWHICH STARTLED HER AS WITH A SENSE OF DREAMING IN DAYLIGHT ANDADVANCING UNCONSCIOUSLY A STEP OR TWO BEYOND THE PROJECTING SLAB OF ABOOKCASE SHE SAW IN THE TERRIBLE ILLUMINATION OF A CERTAINTY WHICHFILLED UP ALL OUTLINES SOMETHING WHICH MADE HER PAUSE MOTIONLESSWITHOUT SELFPOSSESSION ENOUGH TO SPEAK.SEATED WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS HER ON A SOFA WHICH STOOD AGAINST THE WALLON A LINE WITH THE DOOR BY WHICH SHE HAD ENTERED SHE SAW WILLLADISLAW CLOSE BY HIM AND TURNED TOWARDS HIM WITH A FLUSHEDTEARFULNESS WHICH GAVE A NEW BRILLIANCY TO HER FACE SAT ROSAMOND HERBONNET HANGING BACK WHILE WILL LEANING TOWARDS HER CLASPED BOTH HERUPRAISED HANDS IN HIS AND SPOKE WITH LOWTONED FERVOR.ROSAMOND IN HER AGITATED ABSORPTION HAD NOT NOTICED THE SILENTLYADVANCING FIGURE BUT WHEN DOROTHEA AFTER THE FIRST IMMEASURABLEINSTANT OF THIS VISION MOVED CONFUSEDLY BACKWARD AND FOUND HERSELFIMPEDED BY SOME PIECE OF FURNITURE ROSAMOND WAS SUDDENLY AWARE OF HERPRESENCE AND WITH A SPASMODIC MOVEMENT SNATCHED AWAY HER HANDS ANDROSE LOOKING AT DOROTHEA WHO WAS NECESSARILY ARRESTED. WILL LADISLAWSTARTING UP LOOKED ROUND ALSO AND MEETING DOROTHEAS EYES WITH A NEWLIGHTNING IN THEM SEEMED CHANGING TO MARBLE. BUT SHE IMMEDIATELYTURNED THEM AWAY FROM HIM TO ROSAMOND AND SAID IN A FIRM VOICEEXCUSE ME MRS. LYDGATE THE SERVANT DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU WERE HERE.I CALLED TO DELIVER AN IMPORTANT LETTER FOR MR. LYDGATE WHICH I WISHEDTO PUT INTO YOUR OWN HANDS.SHE LAID DOWN THE LETTER ON THE SMALL TABLE WHICH HAD CHECKED HERRETREAT AND THEN INCLUDING ROSAMOND AND WILL IN ONE DISTANT GLANCE ANDBOW SHE WENT QUICKLY OUT OF THE ROOM MEETING IN THE PASSAGE THESURPRISED MARTHA WHO SAID SHE WAS SORRY THE MISTRESS WAS NOT AT HOMEAND THEN SHOWED THE STRANGE LADY OUT WITH AN INWARD REFLECTION THATGRAND PEOPLE WERE PROBABLY MORE IMPATIENT THAN OTHERS.DOROTHEA WALKED ACROSS THE STREET WITH HER MOST ELASTIC STEP AND WASQUICKLY IN HER CARRIAGE AGAIN.DRIVE ON TO FRESHITT HALL SHE SAID TO THE COACHMAN AND ANY ONELOOKING AT HER MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT THOUGH SHE WAS PALER THAN USUALSHE WAS NEVER ANIMATED BY A MORE SELFPOSSESSED ENERGY. AND THAT WASREALLY HER EXPERIENCE. IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD DRUNK A GREAT DRAUGHT OFSCORN THAT STIMULATED HER BEYOND THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO OTHER FEELINGS.SHE HAD SEEN SOMETHING SO FAR BELOW HER BELIEF THAT HER EMOTIONSRUSHED BACK FROM IT AND MADE AN EXCITED THRONG WITHOUT AN OBJECT. SHENEEDED SOMETHING ACTIVE TO TURN HER EXCITEMENT OUT UPON. SHE FELT POWERTO WALK AND WORK FOR A DAY WITHOUT MEAT OR DRINK. AND SHE WOULD CARRYOUT THE PURPOSE WITH WHICH SHE HAD STARTED IN THE MORNING OF GOING TOFRESHITT AND TIPTON TO TELL SIR JAMES AND HER UNCLE ALL THAT SHE WISHEDTHEM TO KNOW ABOUT LYDGATE WHOSE MARRIED LONELINESS UNDER HIS TRIALNOW PRESENTED ITSELF TO HER WITH NEW SIGNIFICANCE AND MADE HER MOREARDENT IN READINESS TO BE HIS CHAMPION. SHE HAD NEVER FELT ANYTHINGLIKE THIS TRIUMPHANT POWER OF INDIGNATION IN THE STRUGGLE OF HERMARRIED LIFE IN WHICH THERE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A QUICKLY SUBDUING PANGAND SHE TOOK IT AS A SIGN OF NEW STRENGTH.DODO HOW VERY BRIGHT YOUR EYES ARE SAID CELIA WHEN SIR JAMES WASGONE OUT OF THE ROOM. AND YOU DONT SEE ANYTHING YOU LOOK AT ARTHUROR ANYTHING. YOU ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING UNCOMFORTABLE I KNOW. IS ITALL ABOUT MR. LYDGATE OR HAS SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED CELIA HAD BEENUSED TO WATCH HER SISTER WITH EXPECTATION.YES DEAR A GREAT MANY THINGS HAVE HAPPENED SAID DODO IN HER FULLTONES.I WONDER WHAT SAID CELIA FOLDING HER ARMS COZILY AND LEANINGFORWARD UPON THEM.OH ALL THE TROUBLES OF ALL PEOPLE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH SAIDDOROTHEA LIFTING HER ARMS TO THE BACK OF HER HEAD.DEAR ME DODO ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A SCHEME FOR THEM SAID CELIA ALITTLE UNEASY AT THIS HAMLETLIKE RAVING.BUT SIR JAMES CAME IN AGAIN READY TO ACCOMPANY DOROTHEA TO THE GRANGEAND SHE FINISHED HER EXPEDITION WELL NOT SWERVING IN HER RESOLUTIONUNTIL SHE DESCENDED AT HER OWN DOOR.CHAPTER LXXVIII.WOULD IT WERE YESTERDAY AND I I THE GRAVEWITH HER SWEET FAITH ABOVE FOR MONUMENT.ROSAMOND AND WILL STOOD MOTIONLESSTHEY DID NOT KNOW HOW LONGHELOOKING TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE DOROTHEA HAD STOOD AND SHE LOOKINGTOWARDS HIM WITH DOUBT. IT SEEMED AN ENDLESS TIME TO ROSAMOND IN WHOSEINMOST SOUL THERE WAS HARDLY SO MUCH ANNOYANCE AS GRATIFICATION FROMWHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED. SHALLOW NATURES DREAM OF AN EASY SWAY OVER THEEMOTIONS OF OTHERS TRUSTING IMPLICITLY IN THEIR OWN PETTY MAGIC TOTURN THE DEEPEST STREAMS AND CONFIDENT BY PRETTY GESTURES ANDREMARKS OF MAKING THE THING THAT IS NOT AS THOUGH IT WERE. SHE KNEWTHAT WILL HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE BLOW BUT SHE HAD BEEN LITTLE USED TOIMAGINING OTHER PEOPLES STATES OF MIND EXCEPT AS A MATERIAL CUT INTOSHAPE BY HER OWN WISHES AND SHE BELIEVED IN HER OWN POWER TO SOOTHE ORSUBDUE. EVEN TERTIUS THAT MOST PERVERSE OF MEN WAS ALWAYS SUBDUED INTHE LONGRUN EVENTS HAD BEEN OBSTINATE BUT STILL ROSAMOND WOULD HAVESAID NOW AS SHE DID BEFORE HER MARRIAGE THAT SHE NEVER GAVE UP WHATSHE HAD SET HER MIND ON.SHE PUT OUT HER ARM AND LAID THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS ON WILLSCOATSLEEVE.DONT TOUCH ME HE SAID WITH AN UTTERANCE LIKE THE CUT OF A LASHDARTING FROM HER AND CHANGING FROM PINK TO WHITE AND BACK AGAIN AS IFHIS WHOLE FRAME WERE TINGLING WITH THE PAIN OF THE STING. HE WHEELEDROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM AND STOOD OPPOSITE TO HER WITH THETIPS OF HIS FINGERS IN HIS POCKETS AND HIS HEAD THROWN BACK LOOKINGFIERCELY NOT AT ROSAMOND BUT AT A POINT A FEW INCHES AWAY FROM HER.SHE WAS KEENLY OFFENDED BUT THE SIGNS SHE MADE OF THIS WERE SUCH ASONLY LYDGATE WAS USED TO INTERPRET. SHE BECAME SUDDENLY QUIET ANDSEATED HERSELF UNTYING HER HANGING BONNET AND LAYING IT DOWN WITH HERSHAWL. HER LITTLE HANDS WHICH SHE FOLDED BEFORE HER WERE VERY COLD.IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFER FOR WILL IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO HAVE TAKENUP HIS HAT AND GONE AWAY BUT HE HAD FELT NO IMPULSE TO DO THIS ON THECONTRARY HE HAD A HORRIBLE INCLINATION TO STAY AND SHATTER ROSAMONDWITH HIS ANGER. IT SEEMED AS IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAR THE FATALITY SHE HADDRAWN DOWN ON HIM WITHOUT VENTING HIS FURY AS IT WOULD BE TO A PANTHERTO BEAR THE JAVELINWOUND WITHOUT SPRINGING AND BITING. AND YETHOWCOULD HE TELL A WOMAN THAT HE WAS READY TO CURSE HER HE WAS FUMINGUNDER A REPRESSIVE LAW WHICH HE WAS FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HE WASDANGEROUSLY POISED AND ROSAMONDS VOICE NOW BROUGHT THE DECISIVEVIBRATION. IN FLUTELIKE TONES OF SARCASM SHE SAIDYOU CAN EASILY GO AFTER MRS. CASAUBON AND EXPLAIN YOUR PREFERENCE.GO AFTER HER HE BURST OUT WITH A SHARP EDGE IN HIS VOICE. DO YOUTHINK SHE WOULD TURN TO LOOK AT ME OR VALUE ANY WORD I EVER UTTERED TOHER AGAIN AT MORE THAN A DIRTY FEATHEREXPLAIN HOW CAN A MAN EXPLAINAT THE EXPENSE OF A WOMANYOU CAN TELL HER WHAT YOU PLEASE SAID ROSAMOND WITH MORE TREMOR.DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE WOULD LIKE ME BETTER FOR SACRIFICING YOU SHE ISNOT A WOMAN TO BE FLATTERED BECAUSE I MADE MYSELF DESPICABLETO BELIEVETHAT I MUST BE TRUE TO HER BECAUSE I WAS A DASTARD TO YOU.HE BEGAN TO MOVE ABOUT WITH THE RESTLESSNESS OF A WILD ANIMAL THAT SEESPREY BUT CANNOT REACH IT. PRESENTLY HE BURST OUT AGAINI HAD NO HOPE BEFORENOT MUCHOF ANYTHING BETTER TO COME. BUT I HADONE CERTAINTYTHAT SHE BELIEVED IN ME. WHATEVER PEOPLE HAD SAID OR DONEABOUT ME SHE BELIEVED IN ME.THATS GONE SHELL NEVER AGAIN THINK MEANYTHING BUT A PALTRY PRETENCETOO NICE TO TAKE HEAVEN EXCEPT UPONFLATTERING CONDITIONS AND YET SELLING MYSELF FOR ANY DEVILS CHANGE BYTHE SLY. SHELL THINK OF ME AS AN INCARNATE INSULT TO HER FROM THEFIRST MOMENT WEWILL STOPPED AS IF HE HAD FOUND HIMSELF GRASPING SOMETHING THAT MUSTNOT BE THROWN AND SHATTERED. HE FOUND ANOTHER VENT FOR HIS RAGE BYSNATCHING UP ROSAMONDS WORDS AGAIN AS IF THEY WERE REPTILES TO BETHROTTLED AND FLUNG OFF.EXPLAIN TELL A MAN TO EXPLAIN HOW HE DROPPED INTO HELL EXPLAIN MYPREFERENCE I NEVER HAD A PREFERENCE FOR HER ANY MORE THAN I HAVE APREFERENCE FOR BREATHING. NO OTHER WOMAN EXISTS BY THE SIDE OF HER. IWOULD RATHER TOUCH HER HAND IF IT WERE DEAD THAN I WOULD TOUCH ANYOTHER WOMANS LIVING.ROSAMOND WHILE THESE POISONED WEAPONS WERE BEING HURLED AT HER WASALMOST LOSING THE SENSE OF HER IDENTITY AND SEEMED TO BE WAKING INTOSOME NEW TERRIBLE EXISTENCE. SHE HAD NO SENSE OF CHILL RESOLUTEREPULSION OF RETICENT SELFJUSTIFICATION SUCH AS SHE HAD KNOWN UNDERLYDGATES MOST STORMY DISPLEASURE ALL HER SENSIBILITY WAS TURNED INTOA BEWILDERING NOVELTY OF PAIN SHE FELT A NEW TERRIFIED RECOIL UNDER ALASH NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE. WHAT ANOTHER NATURE FELT IN OPPOSITIONTO HER OWN WAS BEING BURNT AND BITTEN INTO HER CONSCIOUSNESS. WHEN WILLHAD CEASED TO SPEAK SHE HAD BECOME AN IMAGE OF SICKENED MISERY HERLIPS WERE PALE AND HER EYES HAD A TEARLESS DISMAY IN THEM. IF IT HADBEEN TERTIUS WHO STOOD OPPOSITE TO HER THAT LOOK OF MISERY WOULD HAVEBEEN A PANG TO HIM AND HE WOULD HAVE SUNK BY HER SIDE TO COMFORT HERWITH THAT STRONGARMED COMFORT WHICH SHE HAD OFTEN HELD VERY CHEAP.LET IT BE FORGIVEN TO WILL THAT HE HAD NO SUCH MOVEMENT OF PITY. HE HADFELT NO BOND BEFOREHAND TO THIS WOMAN WHO HAD SPOILED THE IDEALTREASURE OF HIS LIFE AND HE HELD HIMSELF BLAMELESS. HE KNEW THAT HEWAS CRUEL BUT HE HAD NO RELENTING IN HIM YET.AFTER HE HAD DONE SPEAKING HE STILL MOVED ABOUT HALF IN ABSENCE OFMIND AND ROSAMOND SAT PERFECTLY STILL. AT LENGTH WILL SEEMING TOBETHINK HIMSELF TOOK UP HIS HAT YET STOOD SOME MOMENTS IRRESOLUTE. HEHAD SPOKEN TO HER IN A WAY THAT MADE A PHRASE OF COMMON POLITENESSDIFFICULT TO UTTER AND YET NOW THAT HE HAD COME TO THE POINT OF GOINGAWAY FROM HER WITHOUT FURTHER SPEECH HE SHRANK FROM IT AS A BRUTALITYHE FELT CHECKED AND STULTIFIED IN HIS ANGER. HE WALKED TOWARDS THEMANTELPIECE AND LEANED HIS ARM ON IT AND WAITED IN SILENCE FORHEHARDLY KNEW WHAT. THE VINDICTIVE FIRE WAS STILL BURNING IN HIM AND HECOULD UTTER NO WORD OF RETRACTATION BUT IT WAS NEVERTHELESS IN HISMIND THAT HAVING COME BACK TO THIS HEARTH WHERE HE HAD ENJOYED ACARESSING FRIENDSHIP HE HAD FOUND CALAMITY SEATED THEREHE HAD HADSUDDENLY REVEALED TO HIM A TROUBLE THAT LAY OUTSIDE THE HOME AS WELL ASWITHIN IT. AND WHAT SEEMED A FOREBODING WAS PRESSING UPON HIM AS WITHSLOW PINCERSTHAT HIS LIFE MIGHT COME TO BE ENSLAVED BY THIS HELPLESSWOMAN WHO HAD THROWN HERSELF UPON HIM IN THE DREARY SADNESS OF HERHEART. BUT HE WAS IN GLOOMY REBELLION AGAINST THE FACT THAT HIS QUICKAPPREHENSIVENESS FORESHADOWED TO HIM AND WHEN HIS EYES FELL ONROSAMONDS BLIGHTED FACE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS THE MORE PITIABLEOF THE TWO FOR PAIN MUST ENTER INTO ITS GLORIFIED LIFE OF MEMORYBEFORE IT CAN TURN INTO COMPASSION.AND SO THEY REMAINED FOR MANY MINUTES OPPOSITE EACH OTHER FAR APARTIN SILENCE WILLS FACE STILL POSSESSED BY A MUTE RAGE AND ROSAMONDSBY A MUTE MISERY. THE POOR THING HAD NO FORCE TO FLING OUT ANY PASSIONIN RETURN THE TERRIBLE COLLAPSE OF THE ILLUSION TOWARDS WHICH ALL HERHOPE HAD BEEN STRAINED WAS A STROKE WHICH HAD TOO THOROUGHLY SHAKENHER HER LITTLE WORLD WAS IN RUINS AND SHE FELT HERSELF TOTTERING INTHE MIDST AS A LONELY BEWILDERED CONSCIOUSNESS.WILL WISHED THAT SHE WOULD SPEAK AND BRING SOME MITIGATING SHADOWACROSS HIS OWN CRUEL SPEECH WHICH SEEMED TO STAND STARING AT THEM BOTHIN MOCKERY OF ANY ATTEMPT AT REVIVED FELLOWSHIP. BUT SHE SAID NOTHINGAND AT LAST WITH A DESPERATE EFFORT OVER HIMSELF HE ASKED SHALL ICOME IN AND SEE LYDGATE THIS EVENINGIF YOU LIKE ROSAMOND ANSWERED JUST AUDIBLY.AND THEN WILL WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE MARTHA NEVER KNOWING THAT HE HADBEEN IN.AFTER HE WAS GONE ROSAMOND TRIED TO GET UP FROM HER SEAT BUT FELLBACK FAINTING. WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AGAIN SHE FELT TOO ILL TO MAKETHE EXERTION OF RISING TO RING THE BELL AND SHE REMAINED HELPLESSUNTIL THE GIRL SURPRISED AT HER LONG ABSENCE THOUGHT FOR THE FIRSTTIME OF LOOKING FOR HER IN ALL THE DOWNSTAIRS ROOMS. ROSAMOND SAIDTHAT SHE HAD FELT SUDDENLY SICK AND FAINT AND WANTED TO BE HELPEDUPSTAIRS. WHEN THERE SHE THREW HERSELF ON THE BED WITH HER CLOTHES ONAND LAY IN APPARENT TORPOR AS SHE HAD DONE ONCE BEFORE ON A MEMORABLEDAY OF GRIEF.LYDGATE CAME HOME EARLIER THAN HE HAD EXPECTED ABOUT HALFPAST FIVEAND FOUND HER THERE. THE PERCEPTION THAT SHE WAS ILL THREW EVERY OTHERTHOUGHT INTO THE BACKGROUND. WHEN HE FELT HER PULSE HER EYES RESTED ONHIM WITH MORE PERSISTENCE THAN THEY HAD DONE FOR A LONG WHILE AS IFSHE FELT SOME CONTENT THAT HE WAS THERE. HE PERCEIVED THE DIFFERENCE INA MOMENT AND SEATING HIMSELF BY HER PUT HIS ARM GENTLY UNDER HER ANDBENDING OVER HER SAID MY POOR ROSAMOND HAS SOMETHING AGITATED YOUCLINGING TO HIM SHE FELL INTO HYSTERICAL SOBBINGS AND CRIES AND FORTHE NEXT HOUR HE DID NOTHING BUT SOOTHE AND TEND HER. HE IMAGINED THATDOROTHEA HAD BEEN TO SEE HER AND THAT ALL THIS EFFECT ON HER NERVOUSSYSTEM WHICH EVIDENTLY INVOLVED SOME NEW TURNING TOWARDS HIMSELF WASDUE TO THE EXCITEMENT OF THE NEW IMPRESSIONS WHICH THAT VISIT HADRAISED.CHAPTER LXXIX.NOW I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT JUST AS THEY HAD ENDED THEIR TALK THEYDREW NIGH TO A VERY MIRY SLOUGH THAT WAS IN THE MIDST OF THE PLAINAND THEY BEING HEEDLESS DID BOTH FALL SUDDENLY INTO THE BOG. THE NAMEOF THE SLOUGH WAS DESPOND.BUNYAN.WHEN ROSAMOND WAS QUIET AND LYDGATE HAD LEFT HER HOPING THAT SHEMIGHT SOON SLEEP UNDER THE EFFECT OF AN ANODYNE HE WENT INTO THEDRAWINGROOM TO FETCH A BOOK WHICH HE HAD LEFT THERE MEANING TO SPENDTHE EVENING IN HIS WORKROOM AND HE SAW ON THE TABLE DOROTHEAS LETTERADDRESSED TO HIM. HE HAD NOT VENTURED TO ASK ROSAMOND IF MRS. CASAUBONHAD CALLED BUT THE READING OF THIS LETTER ASSURED HIM OF THE FACT FORDOROTHEA MENTIONED THAT IT WAS TO BE CARRIED BY HERSELF.WHEN WILL LADISLAW CAME IN A LITTLE LATER LYDGATE MET HIM WITH ASURPRISE WHICH MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN TOLD OF THE EARLIERVISIT AND WILL COULD NOT SAY DID NOT MRS. LYDGATE TELL YOU THAT ICAME THIS MORNINGPOOR ROSAMOND IS ILL LYDGATE ADDED IMMEDIATELY ON HIS GREETING.NOT SERIOUSLY I HOPE SAID WILL.NOONLY A SLIGHT NERVOUS SHOCKTHE EFFECT OF SOME AGITATION. SHE HASBEEN OVERWROUGHT LATELY. THE TRUTH IS LADISLAW I AM AN UNLUCKY DEVIL.WE HAVE GONE THROUGH SEVERAL ROUNDS OF PURGATORY SINCE YOU LEFT AND IHAVE LATELY GOT ON TO A WORSE LEDGE OF IT THAN EVER. I SUPPOSE YOU AREONLY JUST COME DOWNYOU LOOK RATHER BATTEREDYOU HAVE NOT BEEN LONGENOUGH IN THE TOWN TO HEAR ANYTHINGI TRAVELLED ALL NIGHT AND GOT TO THE WHITE HART AT EIGHT OCLOCK THISMORNING. I HAVE BEEN SHUTTING MYSELF UP AND RESTING SAID WILLFEELING HIMSELF A SNEAK BUT SEEING NO ALTERNATIVE TO THIS EVASION.AND THEN HE HEARD LYDGATES ACCOUNT OF THE TROUBLES WHICH ROSAMOND HADALREADY DEPICTED TO HIM IN HER WAY. SHE HAD NOT MENTIONED THE FACT OFWILLS NAME BEING CONNECTED WITH THE PUBLIC STORYTHIS DETAIL NOTIMMEDIATELY AFFECTING HERAND HE NOW HEARD IT FOR THE FIRST TIME.I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO TELL YOU THAT YOUR NAME IS MIXED UP WITH THEDISCLOSURES SAID LYDGATE WHO COULD UNDERSTAND BETTER THAN MOST MENHOW LADISLAW MIGHT BE STUNG BY THE REVELATION. YOU WILL BE SURE TOHEAR IT AS SOON AS YOU TURN OUT INTO THE TOWN. I SUPPOSE IT IS TRUETHAT RAFFLES SPOKE TO YOU.YES SAID WILL SARDONICALLY. I SHALL BE FORTUNATE IF GOSSIP DOESNOT MAKE ME THE MOST DISREPUTABLE PERSON IN THE WHOLE AFFAIR. I SHOULDTHINK THE LATEST VERSION MUST BE THAT I PLOTTED WITH RAFFLES TO MURDERBULSTRODE AND RAN AWAY FROM MIDDLEMARCH FOR THE PURPOSE.HE WAS THINKING HERE IS A NEW RING IN THE SOUND OF MY NAME TORECOMMEND IT IN HER HEARING HOWEVERWHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY NOWBUT HE SAID NOTHING OF BULSTRODES OFFER TO HIM. WILL WAS VERY OPEN ANDCARELESS ABOUT HIS PERSONAL AFFAIRS BUT IT WAS AMONG THE MOREEXQUISITE TOUCHES IN NATURES MODELLING OF HIM THAT HE HAD A DELICATEGENEROSITY WHICH WARNED HIM INTO RETICENCE HERE. HE SHRANK FROM SAYINGTHAT HE HAD REJECTED BULSTRODES MONEY IN THE MOMENT WHEN HE WASLEARNING THAT IT WAS LYDGATES MISFORTUNE TO HAVE ACCEPTED IT.LYDGATE TOO WAS RETICENT IN THE MIDST OF HIS CONFIDENCE. HE MADE NOALLUSION TO ROSAMONDS FEELING UNDER THEIR TROUBLE AND OF DOROTHEA HEONLY SAID MRS. CASAUBON HAS BEEN THE ONE PERSON TO COME FORWARD ANDSAY THAT SHE HAD NO BELIEF IN ANY OF THE SUSPICIONS AGAINST ME.OBSERVING A CHANGE IN WILLS FACE HE AVOIDED ANY FURTHER MENTION OFHER FEELING HIMSELF TOO IGNORANT OF THEIR RELATION TO EACH OTHER NOTTO FEAR THAT HIS WORDS MIGHT HAVE SOME HIDDEN PAINFUL BEARING ON IT.AND IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT DOROTHEA WAS THE REAL CAUSE OF THE PRESENTVISIT TO MIDDLEMARCH.THE TWO MEN WERE PITYING EACH OTHER BUT IT WAS ONLY WILL WHO GUESSEDTHE EXTENT OF HIS COMPANIONS TROUBLE. WHEN LYDGATE SPOKE WITHDESPERATE RESIGNATION OF GOING TO SETTLE IN LONDON AND SAID WITH AFAINT SMILE WE SHALL HAVE YOU AGAIN OLD FELLOW WILL FELTINEXPRESSIBLY MOURNFUL AND SAID NOTHING. ROSAMOND HAD THAT MORNINGENTREATED HIM TO URGE THIS STEP ON LYDGATE AND IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IFHE WERE BEHOLDING IN A MAGIC PANORAMA A FUTURE WHERE HE HIMSELF WASSLIDING INTO THAT PLEASURELESS YIELDING TO THE SMALL SOLICITATIONS OFCIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IS A COMMONER HISTORY OF PERDITION THAN ANY SINGLEMOMENTOUS BARGAIN.WE ARE ON A PERILOUS MARGIN WHEN WE BEGIN TO LOOK PASSIVELY AT OURFUTURE SELVES AND SEE OUR OWN FIGURES LED WITH DULL CONSENT INTOINSIPID MISDOING AND SHABBY ACHIEVEMENT. POOR LYDGATE WAS INWARDLYGROANING ON THAT MARGIN AND WILL WAS ARRIVING AT IT. IT SEEMED TO HIMTHIS EVENING AS IF THE CRUELTY OF HIS OUTBURST TO ROSAMOND HAD MADE ANOBLIGATION FOR HIM AND HE DREADED THE OBLIGATION HE DREADED LYDGATESUNSUSPECTING GOODWILL HE DREADED HIS OWN DISTASTE FOR HIS SPOILEDLIFE WHICH WOULD LEAVE HIM IN MOTIVELESS LEVITY.CHAPTER LXXX.STERN LAWGIVER YET THOU DOST WEARTHE GODHEADS MOST BENIGNANT GRACENOR KNOW WE ANYTHING SO FAIRAS IS THE SMILE UPON THY FACEFLOWERS LAUGH BEFORE THEE ON THEIR BEDSAND FRAGRANCE IN THY FOOTING TREADSTHOU DOST PRESERVE THE STARS FROM WRONGAND THE MOST ANCIENT HEAVENS THROUGH THEE ARE FRESH AND STRONG.WORDSWORTH ODE TO DUTY.WHEN DOROTHEA HAD SEEN MR. FAREBROTHER IN THE MORNING SHE HAD PROMISEDTO GO AND DINE AT THE PARSONAGE ON HER RETURN FROM FRESHITT. THERE WASA FREQUENT INTERCHANGE OF VISITS BETWEEN HER AND THE FAREBROTHERFAMILY WHICH ENABLED HER TO SAY THAT SHE WAS NOT AT ALL LONELY AT THEMANOR AND TO RESIST FOR THE PRESENT THE SEVERE PRESCRIPTION OF A LADYCOMPANION. WHEN SHE REACHED HOME AND REMEMBERED HER ENGAGEMENT SHE WASGLAD OF IT AND FINDING THAT SHE HAD STILL AN HOUR BEFORE SHE COULDDRESS FOR DINNER SHE WALKED STRAIGHT TO THE SCHOOLHOUSE AND ENTEREDINTO A CONVERSATION WITH THE MASTER AND MISTRESS ABOUT THE NEW BELLGIVING EAGER ATTENTION TO THEIR SMALL DETAILS AND REPETITIONS ANDGETTING UP A DRAMATIC SENSE THAT HER LIFE WAS VERY BUSY. SHE PAUSED ONHER WAY BACK TO TALK TO OLD MASTER BUNNEY WHO WAS PUTTING IN SOMEGARDENSEEDS AND DISCOURSED WISELY WITH THAT RURAL SAGE ABOUT THECROPS THAT WOULD MAKE THE MOST RETURN ON A PERCH OF GROUND AND THERESULT OF SIXTY YEARS EXPERIENCE AS TO SOILSNAMELY THAT IF YOUR SOILWAS PRETTY MELLOW IT WOULD DO BUT IF THERE CAME WET WET WET TO MAKEIT ALL OF A MUMMY WHY THENFINDING THAT THE SOCIAL SPIRIT HAD BEGUILED HER INTO BEING RATHER LATESHE DRESSED HASTILY AND WENT OVER TO THE PARSONAGE RATHER EARLIER THANWAS NECESSARY.

THAT SORTOF WORK TELLS UPON ONE AFTER THE EXCITEMENT IS OVER.HE GAVE HER HIS ARM BACK TO THE MANOR BUT DOROTHEA DID NOT ATTEMPT TOSPEAK EVEN WHEN HE SAID GOODNIGHT.THE LIMIT OF RESISTANCE WAS REACHED AND SHE HAD SUNK BACK HELPLESSWITHIN THE CLUTCH OF INESCAPABLE ANGUISH. DISMISSING TANTRIPP WITH AFEW FAINT WORDS SHE LOCKED HER DOOR AND TURNING AWAY FROM IT TOWARDSTHE VACANT ROOM SHE PRESSED HER HANDS HARD ON THE TOP OF HER HEAD ANDMOANED OUTOH I DID LOVE HIMTHEN CAME THE HOUR IN WHICH THE WAVES OF SUFFERING SHOOK HER TOOTHOROUGHLY TO LEAVE ANY POWER OF THOUGHT. SHE COULD ONLY CRY IN LOUDWHISPERS BETWEEN HER SOBS AFTER HER LOST BELIEF WHICH SHE HAD PLANTEDAND KEPT ALIVE FROM A VERY LITTLE SEED SINCE THE DAYS IN ROMEAFTER HERLOST JOY OF CLINGING WITH SILENT LOVE AND FAITH TO ONE WHO MISPRIZEDBY OTHERS WAS WORTHY IN HER THOUGHTAFTER HER LOST WOMANS PRIDE OFREIGNING IN HIS MEMORYAFTER HER SWEET DIM PERSPECTIVE OF HOPE THATALONG SOME PATHWAY THEY SHOULD MEET WITH UNCHANGED RECOGNITION AND TAKEUP THE BACKWARD YEARS AS A YESTERDAY.IN THAT HOUR SHE REPEATED WHAT THE MERCIFUL EYES OF SOLITUDE HAVELOOKED ON FOR AGES IN THE SPIRITUAL STRUGGLES OF MANSHE BESOUGHTHARDNESS AND COLDNESS AND ACHING WEARINESS TO BRING HER RELIEF FROM THEMYSTERIOUS INCORPOREAL MIGHT OF HER ANGUISH SHE LAY ON THE BARE FLOORAND LET THE NIGHT GROW COLD AROUND HER WHILE HER GRAND WOMANS FRAMEWAS SHAKEN BY SOBS AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A DESPAIRING CHILD.THERE WERE TWO IMAGESTWO LIVING FORMS THAT TORE HER HEART IN TWO ASIF IT HAD BEEN THE HEART OF A MOTHER WHO SEEMS TO SEE HER CHILD DIVIDEDBY THE SWORD AND PRESSES ONE BLEEDING HALF TO HER BREAST WHILE HERGAZE GOES FORTH IN AGONY TOWARDS THE HALF WHICH IS CARRIED AWAY BY THELYING WOMAN THAT HAS NEVER KNOWN THE MOTHERS PANG.HERE WITH THE NEARNESS OF AN ANSWERING SMILE HERE WITHIN THEVIBRATING BOND OF MUTUAL SPEECH WAS THE BRIGHT CREATURE WHOM SHE HADTRUSTEDWHO HAD COME TO HER LIKE THE SPIRIT OF MORNING VISITING THE DIMVAULT WHERE SHE SAT AS THE BRIDE OF A WORNOUT LIFE AND NOW WITH AFULL CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH HAD NEVER AWAKENED BEFORE SHE STRETCHED OUTHER ARMS TOWARDS HIM AND CRIED WITH BITTER CRIES THAT THEIR NEARNESSWAS A PARTING VISION SHE DISCOVERED HER PASSION TO HERSELF IN THEUNSHRINKING UTTERANCE OF DESPAIR.AND THERE ALOOF YET PERSISTENTLY WITH HER MOVING WHEREVER SHE MOVEDWAS THE WILL LADISLAW WHO WAS A CHANGED BELIEF EXHAUSTED OF HOPE ADETECTED ILLUSIONNO A LIVING MAN TOWARDS WHOM THERE COULD NOT YETSTRUGGLE ANY WAIL OF REGRETFUL PITY FROM THE MIDST OF SCORN ANDINDIGNATION AND JEALOUS OFFENDED PRIDE. THE FIRE OF DOROTHEAS ANGERWAS NOT EASILY SPENT AND IT FLAMED OUT IN FITFUL RETURNS OF SPURNINGREPROACH. WHY HAD HE COME OBTRUDING HIS LIFE INTO HERS HERS THAT MIGHTHAVE BEEN WHOLE ENOUGH WITHOUT HIM WHY HAD HE BROUGHT HIS CHEAP REGARDAND HIS LIPBORN WORDS TO HER WHO HAD NOTHING PALTRY TO GIVE INEXCHANGE HE KNEW THAT HE WAS DELUDING HERWISHED IN THE VERY MOMENTOF FAREWELL TO MAKE HER BELIEVE THAT HE GAVE HER THE WHOLE PRICE OFHER HEART AND KNEW THAT HE HAD SPENT IT HALF BEFORE. WHY HAD HE NOTSTAYED AMONG THE CROWD OF WHOM SHE ASKED NOTHINGBUT ONLY PRAYED THATTHEY MIGHT BE LESS CONTEMPTIBLEBUT SHE LOST ENERGY AT LAST EVEN FOR HER LOUDWHISPERED CRIES ANDMOANS SHE SUBSIDED INTO HELPLESS SOBS AND ON THE COLD FLOOR SHESOBBED HERSELF TO SLEEP.IN THE CHILL HOURS OF THE MORNING TWILIGHT WHEN ALL WAS DIM AROUNDHER SHE AWOKENOT WITH ANY AMAZED WONDERING WHERE SHE WAS OR WHAT HADHAPPENED BUT WITH THE CLEAREST CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE WAS LOOKING INTOTHE EYES OF SORROW. SHE ROSE AND WRAPPED WARM THINGS AROUND HER ANDSEATED HERSELF IN A GREAT CHAIR WHERE SHE HAD OFTEN WATCHED BEFORE. SHEWAS VIGOROUS ENOUGH TO HAVE BORNE THAT HARD NIGHT WITHOUT FEELING ILLIN BODY BEYOND SOME ACHING AND FATIGUE BUT SHE HAD WAKED TO A NEWCONDITION SHE FELT AS IF HER SOUL HAD BEEN LIBERATED FROM ITS TERRIBLECONFLICT SHE WAS NO LONGER WRESTLING WITH HER GRIEF BUT COULD SITDOWN WITH IT AS A LASTING COMPANION AND MAKE IT A SHARER IN HERTHOUGHTS. FOR NOW THE THOUGHTS CAME THICKLY. IT WAS NOT IN DOROTHEASNATURE FOR LONGER THAN THE DURATION OF A PAROXYSM TO SIT IN THENARROW CELL OF HER CALAMITY IN THE BESOTTED MISERY OF A CONSCIOUSNESSTHAT ONLY SEES ANOTHERS LOT AS AN ACCIDENT OF ITS OWN.SHE BEGAN NOW TO LIVE THROUGH THAT YESTERDAY MORNING DELIBERATELYAGAIN FORCING HERSELF TO DWELL ON EVERY DETAIL AND ITS POSSIBLEMEANING. WAS SHE ALONE IN THAT SCENE WAS IT HER EVENT ONLY SHE FORCEDHERSELF TO THINK OF IT AS BOUND UP WITH ANOTHER WOMANS LIFEA WOMANTOWARDS WHOM SHE HAD SET OUT WITH A LONGING TO CARRY SOME CLEARNESS ANDCOMFORT INTO HER BECLOUDED YOUTH. IN HER FIRST OUTLEAP OF JEALOUSINDIGNATION AND DISGUST WHEN QUITTING THE HATEFUL ROOM SHE HAD FLUNGAWAY ALL THE MERCY WITH WHICH SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN THAT VISIT. SHE HADENVELOPED BOTH WILL AND ROSAMOND IN HER BURNING SCORN AND IT SEEMED TOHER AS IF ROSAMOND WERE BURNED OUT OF HER SIGHT FOREVER. BUT THAT BASEPROMPTING WHICH MAKES A WOMEN MORE CRUEL TO A RIVAL THAN TO A FAITHLESSLOVER COULD HAVE NO STRENGTH OF RECURRENCE IN DOROTHEA WHEN THEDOMINANT SPIRIT OF JUSTICE WITHIN HER HAD ONCE OVERCOME THE TUMULT ANDHAD ONCE SHOWN HER THE TRUER MEASURE OF THINGS. ALL THE ACTIVE THOUGHTWITH WHICH SHE HAD BEFORE BEEN REPRESENTING TO HERSELF THE TRIALS OFLYDGATES LOT AND THIS YOUNG MARRIAGE UNION WHICH LIKE HER OWNSEEMED TO HAVE ITS HIDDEN AS WELL AS EVIDENT TROUBLESALL THIS VIVIDSYMPATHETIC EXPERIENCE RETURNED TO HER NOW AS A POWER IT ASSERTEDITSELF AS ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE ASSERTS ITSELF AND WILL NOT LET US SEE ASWE SAW IN THE DAY OF OUR IGNORANCE. SHE SAID TO HER OWN IRREMEDIABLEGRIEF THAT IT SHOULD MAKE HER MORE HELPFUL INSTEAD OF DRIVING HERBACK FROM EFFORT.AND WHAT SORT OF CRISIS MIGHT NOT THIS BE IN THREE LIVES WHOSE CONTACTWITH HERS LAID AN OBLIGATION ON HER AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SUPPLIANTSBEARING THE SACRED BRANCH THE OBJECTS OF HER RESCUE WERE NOT TO BESOUGHT OUT BY HER FANCY THEY WERE CHOSEN FOR HER. SHE YEARNED TOWARDSTHE PERFECT RIGHT THAT IT MIGHT MAKE A THRONE WITHIN HER AND RULE HERERRANT WILL. WHAT SHOULD I DOHOW SHOULD I ACT NOW THIS VERY DAY IFI COULD CLUTCH MY OWN PAIN AND COMPEL IT TO SILENCE AND THINK OFTHOSE THREEIT HAD TAKEN LONG FOR HER TO COME TO THAT QUESTION AND THERE WAS LIGHTPIERCING INTO THE ROOM. SHE OPENED HER CURTAINS AND LOOKED OUT TOWARDSTHE BIT OF ROAD THAT LAY IN VIEW WITH FIELDS BEYOND OUTSIDE THEENTRANCEGATES. ON THE ROAD THERE WAS A MAN WITH A BUNDLE ON HIS BACKAND A WOMAN CARRYING HER BABY IN THE FIELD SHE COULD SEE FIGURESMOVINGPERHAPS THE SHEPHERD WITH HIS DOG. FAR OFF IN THE BENDING SKYWAS THE PEARLY LIGHT AND SHE FELT THE LARGENESS OF THE WORLD AND THEMANIFOLD WAKINGS OF MEN TO LABOR AND ENDURANCE. SHE WAS A PART OF THATINVOLUNTARY PALPITATING LIFE AND COULD NEITHER LOOK OUT ON IT FROMHER LUXURIOUS SHELTER AS A MERE SPECTATOR NOR HIDE HER EYES IN SELFISHCOMPLAINING.WHAT SHE WOULD RESOLVE TO DO THAT DAY DID NOT YET SEEM QUITE CLEAR BUTSOMETHING THAT SHE COULD ACHIEVE STIRRED HER AS WITH AN APPROACHINGMURMUR WHICH WOULD SOON GATHER DISTINCTNESS. SHE TOOK OFF THE CLOTHESWHICH SEEMED TO HAVE SOME OF THE WEARINESS OF A HARD WATCHING IN THEMAND BEGAN TO MAKE HER TOILET. PRESENTLY SHE RANG FOR TANTRIPP WHO CAMEIN HER DRESSINGGOWN.WHY MADAM YOUVE NEVER BEEN IN BED THIS BLESSED NIGHT BURST OUTTANTRIPP LOOKING FIRST AT THE BED AND THEN AT DOROTHEAS FACE WHICHIN SPITE OF BATHING HAD THE PALE CHEEKS AND PINK EYELIDS OF A MATERDOLOROSA. YOULL KILL YOURSELF YOU WILL. ANYBODY MIGHT THINK NOWYOU HAD A RIGHT TO GIVE YOURSELF A LITTLE COMFORT.DONT BE ALARMED TANTRIPP SAID DOROTHEA SMILING. I HAVE SLEPT IAM NOT ILL. I SHALL BE GLAD OF A CUP OF COFFEE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ANDI WANT YOU TO BRING ME MY NEW DRESS AND MOST LIKELY I SHALL WANT MYNEW BONNET TODAY.THEYVE LAIN THERE A MONTH AND MORE READY FOR YOU MADAM AND MOSTTHANKFUL I SHALL BE TO SEE YOU WITH A COUPLE O POUNDS WORTH LESS OFCRAPE SAID TANTRIPP STOOPING TO LIGHT THE FIRE. THERES A REASON INMOURNING AS IVE ALWAYS SAID AND THREE FOLDS AT THE BOTTOM OF YOURSKIRT AND A PLAIN QUILLING IN YOUR BONNETAND IF EVER ANYBODY LOOKEDLIKE AN ANGEL ITS YOU IN A NET QUILLINGIS WHATS CONSISTENT FOR ASECOND YEAR. AT LEAST THATS MY THINKING ENDED TANTRIPP LOOKINGANXIOUSLY AT THE FIRE AND IF ANYBODY WAS TO MARRY ME FLATTERINGHIMSELF I SHOULD WEAR THOSE HIJEOUS WEEPERS TWO YEARS FOR HIM HED BEDECEIVED BY HIS OWN VANITY THATS ALL.THE FIRE WILL DO MY GOOD TAN SAID DOROTHEA SPEAKING AS SHE USED TODO IN THE OLD LAUSANNE DAYS ONLY WITH A VERY LOW VOICE GET ME THECOFFEE.SHE FOLDED HERSELF IN THE LARGE CHAIR AND LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST ITIN FATIGUED QUIESCENCE WHILE TANTRIPP WENT AWAY WONDERING AT THISSTRANGE CONTRARINESS IN HER YOUNG MISTRESSTHAT JUST THE MORNING WHENSHE HAD MORE OF A WIDOWS FACE THAN EVER SHE SHOULD HAVE ASKED FOR HERLIGHTER MOURNING WHICH SHE HAD WAIVED BEFORE. TANTRIPP WOULD NEVER HAVEFOUND THE CLEW TO THIS MYSTERY. DOROTHEA WISHED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHEHAD NOT THE LESS AN ACTIVE LIFE BEFORE HER BECAUSE SHE HAD BURIED APRIVATE JOY AND THE TRADITION THAT FRESH GARMENTS BELONGED TO ALLINITIATION HAUNTING HER MIND MADE HER GRASP AFTER EVEN THAT SLIGHTOUTWARD HELP TOWARDS CALM RESOLVE. FOR THE RESOLVE WAS NOT EASY.NEVERTHELESS AT ELEVEN OCLOCK SHE WAS WALKING TOWARDS MIDDLEMARCHHAVING MADE UP HER MIND THAT SHE WOULD MAKE AS QUIETLY AND UNNOTICEABLYAS POSSIBLE HER SECOND ATTEMPT TO SEE AND SAVE ROSAMOND.CHAPTER LXXXI.DU ERDE WARST AUCH DIESE NACHT BESTNDIGUND ATHMEST NEU ERQUICKT ZU MEINEN FSSENBEGINNEST SCHON MIT LUST MICH ZU UMGEBENDU REGST UND RHRST EIN KRFTIGES BESCHLIESSENZUM HCHSTEN DASEIN IMMERFORT ZU STREBEN.FAUST R THEIL.WHEN DOROTHEA WAS AGAIN AT LYDGATES DOOR SPEAKING TO MARTHA HE WAS INTHE ROOM CLOSE BY WITH THE DOOR AJAR PREPARING TO GO OUT. HE HEARD HERVOICE AND IMMEDIATELY CAME TO HER.DO YOU THINK THAT MRS. LYDGATE CAN RECEIVE ME THIS MORNING SHE SAIDHAVING REFLECTED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO LEAVE OUT ALL ALLUSION TOHER PREVIOUS VISIT.I HAVE NO DOUBT SHE WILL SAID LYDGATE SUPPRESSING HIS THOUGHT ABOUTDOROTHEAS LOOKS WHICH WERE AS MUCH CHANGED AS ROSAMONDS IF YOUWILL BE KIND ENOUGH TO COME IN AND LET ME TELL HER THAT YOU ARE HERE.SHE HAS NOT BEEN VERY WELL SINCE YOU WERE HERE YESTERDAY BUT SHE ISBETTER THIS MORNING AND I THINK IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT SHE WILL BECHEERED BY SEEING YOU AGAIN.IT WAS PLAIN THAT LYDGATE AS DOROTHEA HAD EXPECTED KNEW NOTHING ABOUTTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER YESTERDAYS VISIT NAY HE APPEARED TO IMAGINETHAT SHE HAD CARRIED IT OUT ACCORDING TO HER INTENTION. SHE HADPREPARED A LITTLE NOTE ASKING ROSAMOND TO SEE HER WHICH SHE WOULD HAVEGIVEN TO THE SERVANT IF HE HAD NOT BEEN IN THE WAY BUT NOW SHE WAS INMUCH ANXIETY AS TO THE RESULT OF HIS ANNOUNCEMENT.AFTER LEADING HER INTO THE DRAWINGROOM HE PAUSED TO TAKE A LETTERFROM HIS POCKET AND PUT IT INTO HER HANDS SAYING I WROTE THIS LASTNIGHT AND WAS GOING TO CARRY IT TO LOWICK IN MY RIDE. WHEN ONE ISGRATEFUL FOR SOMETHING TOO GOOD FOR COMMON THANKS WRITING IS LESSUNSATISFACTORY THAN SPEECHONE DOES NOT AT LEAST HEAR HOW INADEQUATETHE WORDS ARE.DOROTHEAS FACE BRIGHTENED. IT IS I WHO HAVE MOST TO THANK FOR SINCEYOU HAVE LET ME TAKE THAT PLACE. YOU HAVE CONSENTED SHE SAIDSUDDENLY DOUBTING.YES THE CHECK IS GOING TO BULSTRODE TODAY.HE SAID NO MORE BUT WENT UPSTAIRS TO ROSAMOND WHO HAD BUT LATELYFINISHED DRESSING HERSELF AND SAT LANGUIDLY WONDERING WHAT SHE SHOULDDO NEXT HER HABITUAL INDUSTRY IN SMALL THINGS EVEN IN THE DAYS OF HERSADNESS PROMPTING HER TO BEGIN SOME KIND OF OCCUPATION WHICH SHEDRAGGED THROUGH SLOWLY OR PAUSED IN FROM LACK OF INTEREST. SHE LOOKEDILL BUT HAD RECOVERED HER USUAL QUIETUDE OF MANNER AND LYDGATE HADFEARED TO DISTURB HER BY ANY QUESTIONS. HE HAD TOLD HER OF DOROTHEASLETTER CONTAINING THE CHECK AND AFTERWARDS HE HAD SAID LADISLAW ISCOME ROSY HE SAT WITH ME LAST NIGHT I DARE SAY HE WILL BE HERE AGAINTODAY. I THOUGHT HE LOOKED RATHER BATTERED AND DEPRESSED. ANDROSAMOND HAD MADE NO REPLY.NOW WHEN HE CAME UP HE SAID TO HER VERY GENTLY ROSY DEAR MRS.CASAUBON IS COME TO SEE YOU AGAIN YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER WOULD YOUNOT THAT SHE COLORED AND GAVE RATHER A STARTLED MOVEMENT DID NOTSURPRISE HIM AFTER THE AGITATION PRODUCED BY THE INTERVIEW YESTERDAYABENEFICENT AGITATION HE THOUGHT SINCE IT SEEMED TO HAVE MADE HER TURNTO HIM AGAIN.ROSAMOND DARED NOT SAY NO. SHE DARED NOT WITH A TONE OF HER VOICE TOUCHTHE FACTS OF YESTERDAY. WHY HAD MRS. CASAUBON COME AGAIN THE ANSWERWAS A BLANK WHICH ROSAMOND COULD ONLY FILL UP WITH DREAD FOR WILLLADISLAWS LACERATING WORDS HAD MADE EVERY THOUGHT OF DOROTHEA A FRESHSMART TO HER. NEVERTHELESS IN HER NEW HUMILIATING UNCERTAINTY SHEDARED DO NOTHING BUT COMPLY. SHE DID NOT SAY YES BUT SHE ROSE AND LETLYDGATE PUT A LIGHT SHAWL OVER HER SHOULDERS WHILE HE SAID I AMGOING OUT IMMEDIATELY. THEN SOMETHING CROSSED HER MIND WHICH PROMPTEDHER TO SAY PRAY TELL MARTHA NOT TO BRING ANY ONE ELSE INTO THEDRAWINGROOM. AND LYDGATE ASSENTED THINKING THAT HE FULLY UNDERSTOODTHIS WISH. HE LED HER DOWN TO THE DRAWINGROOM DOOR AND THEN TURNEDAWAY OBSERVING TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS RATHER A BLUNDERING HUSBAND TOBE DEPENDENT FOR HIS WIFES TRUST IN HIM ON THE INFLUENCE OF ANOTHERWOMAN.ROSAMOND WRAPPING HER SOFT SHAWL AROUND HER AS SHE WALKED TOWARDSDOROTHEA WAS INWARDLY WRAPPING HER SOUL IN COLD RESERVE. HAD MRS.CASAUBON COME TO SAY ANYTHING TO HER ABOUT WILL IF SO IT WAS ALIBERTY THAT ROSAMOND RESENTED AND SHE PREPARED HERSELF TO MEET EVERYWORD WITH POLITE IMPASSIBILITY. WILL HAD BRUISED HER PRIDE TOO SORELYFOR HER TO FEEL ANY COMPUNCTION TOWARDS HIM AND DOROTHEA HER OWNINJURY SEEMED MUCH THE GREATER. DOROTHEA WAS NOT ONLY THE PREFERREDWOMAN BUT HAD ALSO A FORMIDABLE ADVANTAGE IN BEING LYDGATESBENEFACTOR AND TO POOR ROSAMONDS PAINED CONFUSED VISION IT SEEMEDTHAT THIS MRS. CASAUBONTHIS WOMAN WHO PREDOMINATED IN ALL THINGSCONCERNING HERMUST HAVE COME NOW WITH THE SENSE OF HAVING THEADVANTAGE AND WITH ANIMOSITY PROMPTING HER TO USE IT. INDEED NOTROSAMOND ONLY BUT ANY ONE ELSE KNOWING THE OUTER FACTS OF THE CASEAND NOT THE SIMPLE INSPIRATION ON WHICH DOROTHEA ACTED MIGHT WELL HAVEWONDERED WHY SHE CAME.LOOKING LIKE THE LOVELY GHOST OF HERSELF HER GRACEFUL SLIMNESS WRAPPEDIN HER SOFT WHITE SHAWL THE ROUNDED INFANTINE MOUTH AND CHEEKINEVITABLY SUGGESTING MILDNESS AND INNOCENCE ROSAMOND PAUSED AT THREEYARDS DISTANCE FROM HER VISITOR AND BOWED. BUT DOROTHEA WHO HAD TAKENOFF HER GLOVES FROM AN IMPULSE WHICH SHE COULD NEVER RESIST WHEN SHEWANTED A SENSE OF FREEDOM CAME FORWARD AND WITH HER FACE FULL OF ASAD YET SWEET OPENNESS PUT OUT HER HAND. ROSAMOND COULD NOT AVOIDMEETING HER GLANCE COULD NOT AVOID PUTTING HER SMALL HAND INTODOROTHEAS WHICH CLASPED IT WITH GENTLE MOTHERLINESS AND IMMEDIATELYA DOUBT OF HER OWN PREPOSSESSIONS BEGAN TO STIR WITHIN HER. ROSAMONDSEYE WAS QUICK FOR FACES SHE SAW THAT MRS. CASAUBONS FACE LOOKED PALEAND CHANGED SINCE YESTERDAY YET GENTLE AND LIKE THE FIRM SOFTNESS OFHER HAND. BUT DOROTHEA HAD COUNTED A LITTLE TOO MUCH ON HER OWNSTRENGTH THE CLEARNESS AND INTENSITY OF HER MENTAL ACTION THIS MORNINGWERE THE CONTINUANCE OF A NERVOUS EXALTATION WHICH MADE HER FRAME ASDANGEROUSLY RESPONSIVE AS A BIT OF FINEST VENETIAN CRYSTAL AND INLOOKING AT ROSAMOND SHE SUDDENLY FOUND HER HEART SWELLING AND WASUNABLE TO SPEAKALL HER EFFORT WAS REQUIRED TO KEEP BACK TEARS. SHESUCCEEDED IN THAT AND THE EMOTION ONLY PASSED OVER HER FACE LIKE THESPIRIT OF A SOB BUT IT ADDED TO ROSAMONDS IMPRESSION THAT MRS.CASAUBONS STATE OF MIND MUST BE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHATSHE HAD IMAGINED.SO THEY SAT DOWN WITHOUT A WORD OF PREFACE ON THE TWO CHAIRS THATHAPPENED TO BE NEAREST AND HAPPENED ALSO TO BE CLOSE TOGETHER THOUGHROSAMONDS NOTION WHEN SHE FIRST BOWED WAS THAT SHE SHOULD STAY A LONGWAY OFF FROM MRS. CASAUBON. BUT SHE CEASED THINKING HOW ANYTHING WOULDTURN OUTMERELY WONDERING WHAT WOULD COME. AND DOROTHEA BEGAN TO SPEAKQUITE SIMPLY GATHERING FIRMNESS AS SHE WENT ON.I HAD AN ERRAND YESTERDAY WHICH I DID NOT FINISH THAT IS WHY I AMHERE AGAIN SO SOON. YOU WILL NOT THINK ME TOO TROUBLESOME WHEN I TELLYOU THAT I CAME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE INJUSTICE THAT HAS BEEN SHOWNTOWARDS MR. LYDGATE. IT WILL CHEER YOUWILL IT NOTTO KNOW A GREATDEAL ABOUT HIM THAT HE MAY NOT LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT HIMSELF JUSTBECAUSE IT IS IN HIS OWN VINDICATION AND TO HIS OWN HONOR. YOU WILLLIKE TO KNOW THAT YOUR HUSBAND HAS WARM FRIENDS WHO HAVE NOT LEFT OFFBELIEVING IN HIS HIGH CHARACTER YOU WILL LET ME SPEAK OF THIS WITHOUTTHINKING THAT I TAKE A LIBERTYTHE CORDIAL PLEADING TONES WHICH SEEMED TO FLOW WITH GENEROUSHEEDLESSNESS ABOVE ALL THE FACTS WHICH HAD FILLED ROSAMONDS MIND ASGROUNDS OF OBSTRUCTION AND HATRED BETWEEN HER AND THIS WOMAN CAME ASSOOTHINGLY AS A WARM STREAM OVER HER SHRINKING FEARS. OF COURSE MRS.CASAUBON HAD THE FACTS IN HER MIND BUT SHE WAS NOT GOING TO SPEAK OFANYTHING CONNECTED WITH THEM. THAT RELIEF WAS TOO GREAT FOR ROSAMOND TOFEEL MUCH ELSE AT THE MOMENT. SHE ANSWERED PRETTILY IN THE NEW EASE OFHER SOULI KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD. I SHALL LIKE TO HEAR ANYTHING YOU WILLSAY TO ME ABOUT TERTIUS.THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY SAID DOROTHEA WHEN I HAD ASKED HIM TOCOME TO LOWICK TO GIVE ME HIS OPINION ON THE AFFAIRS OF THE HOSPITALHE TOLD ME EVERYTHING ABOUT HIS CONDUCT AND FEELINGS IN THIS SAD EVENTWHICH HAS MADE IGNORANT PEOPLE CAST SUSPICIONS ON HIM. THE REASON HETOLD ME WAS BECAUSE I WAS VERY BOLD AND ASKED HIM. I BELIEVED THAT HEHAD NEVER ACTED DISHONORABLY AND I BEGGED HIM TO TELL ME THE HISTORY.HE CONFESSED TO ME THAT HE HAD NEVER TOLD IT BEFORE NOT EVEN TO YOUBECAUSE HE HAD A GREAT DISLIKE TO SAY I WAS NOT WRONG AS IF THATWERE PROOF WHEN THERE ARE GUILTY PEOPLE WHO WILL SAY SO. THE TRUTH ISHE KNEW NOTHING OF THIS MAN RAFFLES OR THAT THERE WERE ANY BAD SECRETSABOUT HIM AND HE THOUGHT THAT MR. BULSTRODE OFFERED HIM THE MONEYBECAUSE HE REPENTED OUT OF KINDNESS OF HAVING REFUSED IT BEFORE. ALLHIS ANXIETY ABOUT HIS PATIENT WAS TO TREAT HIM RIGHTLY AND HE WAS ALITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE THAT THE CASE DID NOT END AS HE HAD EXPECTED BUTHE THOUGHT THEN AND STILL THINKS THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN NO WRONG INIT ON ANY ONES PART. AND I HAVE TOLD MR. FAREBROTHER AND MR. BROOKEAND SIR JAMES CHETTAM THEY ALL BELIEVE IN YOUR HUSBAND. THAT WILLCHEER YOU WILL IT NOT THAT WILL GIVE YOU COURAGEDOROTHEAS FACE HAD BECOME ANIMATED AND AS IT BEAMED ON ROSAMOND VERYCLOSE TO HER SHE FELT SOMETHING LIKE BASHFUL TIMIDITY BEFORE ASUPERIOR IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS SELFFORGETFUL ARDOR. SHE SAID WITHBLUSHING EMBARRASSMENT THANK YOU YOU ARE VERY KIND.AND HE FELT THAT HE HAD BEEN SO WRONG NOT TO POUR OUT EVERYTHING ABOUTTHIS TO YOU. BUT YOU WILL FORGIVE HIM. IT WAS BECAUSE HE FEELS SO MUCHMORE ABOUT YOUR HAPPINESS THAN ANYTHING ELSEHE FEELS HIS LIFE BOUNDINTO ONE WITH YOURS AND IT HURTS HIM MORE THAN ANYTHING THAT HISMISFORTUNES MUST HURT YOU. HE COULD SPEAK TO ME BECAUSE I AM ANINDIFFERENT PERSON. AND THEN I ASKED HIM IF I MIGHT COME TO SEE YOUBECAUSE I FELT SO MUCH FOR HIS TROUBLE AND YOURS. THAT IS WHY I CAMEYESTERDAY AND WHY I AM COME TODAY. TROUBLE IS SO HARD TO BEAR IS ITNOT HOW CAN WE LIVE AND THINK THAT ANY ONE HAS TROUBLEPIERCINGTROUBLEAND WE COULD HELP THEM AND NEVER TRYDOROTHEA COMPLETELY SWAYED BY THE FEELING THAT SHE WAS UTTERINGFORGOT EVERYTHING BUT THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING FROM OUT THE HEART OF HEROWN TRIAL TO ROSAMONDS. THE EMOTION HAD WROUGHT ITSELF MORE AND MOREINTO HER UTTERANCE TILL THE TONES MIGHT HAVE GONE TO ONES VERYMARROW LIKE A LOW CRY FROM SOME SUFFERING CREATURE IN THE DARKNESS.AND SHE HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY LAID HER HAND AGAIN ON THE LITTLE HAND THATSHE HAD PRESSED BEFORE.ROSAMOND WITH AN OVERMASTERING PANG AS IF A WOUND WITHIN HER HAD BEENPROBED BURST INTO HYSTERICAL CRYING AS SHE HAD DONE THE DAY BEFOREWHEN SHE CLUNG TO HER HUSBAND. POOR DOROTHEA WAS FEELING A GREAT WAVEOF HER OWN SORROW RETURNING OVER HERHER THOUGHT BEING DRAWN TO THEPOSSIBLE SHARE THAT WILL LADISLAW MIGHT HAVE IN ROSAMONDS MENTALTUMULT. SHE WAS BEGINNING TO FEAR THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TOSUPPRESS HERSELF ENOUGH TO THE END OF THIS MEETING AND WHILE HER HANDWAS STILL RESTING ON ROSAMONDS LAP THOUGH THE HAND UNDERNEATH IT WASWITHDRAWN SHE WAS STRUGGLING AGAINST HER OWN RISING SOBS. SHE TRIED TOMASTER HERSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT BE A TURNINGPOINT INTHREE LIVESNOT IN HER OWN NO THERE THE IRREVOCABLE HAD HAPPENEDBUTIN THOSE THREE LIVES WHICH WERE TOUCHING HERS WITH THE SOLEMNNEIGHBORHOOD OF DANGER AND DISTRESS. THE FRAGILE CREATURE WHO WASCRYING CLOSE TO HERTHERE MIGHT STILL BE TIME TO RESCUE HER FROM THEMISERY OF FALSE INCOMPATIBLE BONDS AND THIS MOMENT WAS UNLIKE ANYOTHER SHE AND ROSAMOND COULD NEVER BE TOGETHER AGAIN WITH THE SAMETHRILLING CONSCIOUSNESS OF YESTERDAY WITHIN THEM BOTH. SHE FELT THERELATION BETWEEN THEM TO BE PECULIAR ENOUGH TO GIVE HER A PECULIARINFLUENCE THOUGH SHE HAD NO CONCEPTION THAT THE WAY IN WHICH HER OWNFEELINGS WERE INVOLVED WAS FULLY KNOWN TO MRS. LYDGATE.IT WAS A NEWER CRISIS IN ROSAMONDS EXPERIENCE THAN EVEN DOROTHEA COULDIMAGINE SHE WAS UNDER THE FIRST GREAT SHOCK THAT HAD SHATTERED HERDREAMWORLD IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN EASILY CONFIDENT OF HERSELF ANDCRITICAL OF OTHERS AND THIS STRANGE UNEXPECTED MANIFESTATION OFFEELING IN A WOMAN WHOM SHE HAD APPROACHED WITH A SHRINKING AVERSIONAND DREAD AS ONE WHO MUST NECESSARILY HAVE A JEALOUS HATRED TOWARDSHER MADE HER SOUL TOTTER ALL THE MORE WITH A SENSE THAT SHE HAD BEENWALKING IN AN UNKNOWN WORLD WHICH HAD JUST BROKEN IN UPON HER.WHEN ROSAMONDS CONVULSED THROAT WAS SUBSIDING INTO CALM AND SHEWITHDREW THE HANDKERCHIEF WITH WHICH SHE HAD BEEN HIDING HER FACE HEREYES MET DOROTHEAS AS HELPLESSLY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN BLUE FLOWERS.WHAT WAS THE USE OF THINKING ABOUT BEHAVIOR AFTER THIS CRYING ANDDOROTHEA LOOKED ALMOST AS CHILDISH WITH THE NEGLECTED TRACE OF ASILENT TEAR. PRIDE WAS BROKEN DOWN BETWEEN THESE TWO.WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND DOROTHEA SAID WITH SOMETIMIDITY. I THOUGHT HIS LOOKS WERE SADLY CHANGED WITH SUFFERING THEOTHER DAY. I HAD NOT SEEN HIM FOR MANY WEEKS BEFORE. HE SAID HE HADBEEN FEELING VERY LONELY IN HIS TRIAL BUT I THINK HE WOULD HAVE BORNEIT ALL BETTER IF HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO BE QUITE OPEN WITH YOU.TERTIUS IS SO ANGRY AND IMPATIENT IF I SAY ANYTHING SAID ROSAMONDIMAGINING THAT HE HAD BEEN COMPLAINING OF HER TO DOROTHEA. HE OUGHTNOT TO WONDER THAT I OBJECT TO SPEAK TO HIM ON PAINFUL SUBJECTS.IT WAS HIMSELF HE BLAMED FOR NOT SPEAKING SAID DOROTHEA. WHAT HESAID OF YOU WAS THAT HE COULD NOT BE HAPPY IN DOING ANYTHING WHICHMADE YOU UNHAPPYTHAT HIS MARRIAGE WAS OF COURSE A BOND WHICH MUSTAFFECT HIS CHOICE ABOUT EVERYTHING AND FOR THAT REASON HE REFUSED MYPROPOSAL THAT HE SHOULD KEEP HIS POSITION AT THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE THATWOULD BIND HIM TO STAY IN MIDDLEMARCH AND HE WOULD NOT UNDERTAKE TO DOANYTHING WHICH WOULD BE PAINFUL TO YOU. HE COULD SAY THAT TO MEBECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT I HAD MUCH TRIAL IN MY MARRIAGE FROM MYHUSBANDS ILLNESS WHICH HINDERED HIS PLANS AND SADDENED HIM AND HEKNOWS THAT I HAVE FELT HOW HARD IT IS TO WALK ALWAYS IN FEAR OF HURTINGANOTHER WHO IS TIED TO US.DOROTHEA WAITED A LITTLE SHE HAD DISCERNED A FAINT PLEASURE STEALINGOVER ROSAMONDS FACE. BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND SHE WENT ON WITH AGATHERING TREMOR MARRIAGE IS SO UNLIKE EVERYTHING ELSE. THERE ISSOMETHING EVEN AWFUL IN THE NEARNESS IT BRINGS. EVEN IF WE LOVED SOMEONE ELSE BETTER THANTHAN THOSE WE WERE MARRIED TO IT WOULD BE NOUSEPOOR DOROTHEA IN HER PALPITATING ANXIETY COULD ONLY SEIZE HERLANGUAGE BROKENLYI MEAN MARRIAGE DRINKS UP ALL OUR POWER OF GIVINGOR GETTING ANY BLESSEDNESS IN THAT SORT OF LOVE. I KNOW IT MAY BE VERYDEARBUT IT MURDERS OUR MARRIAGEAND THEN THE MARRIAGE STAYS WITH USLIKE A MURDERAND EVERYTHING ELSE IS GONE. AND THEN OUR HUSBANDIF HELOVED AND TRUSTED US AND WE HAVE NOT HELPED HIM BUT MADE A CURSE INHIS LIFEHER VOICE HAD SUNK VERY LOW THERE WAS A DREAD UPON HER OF PRESUMINGTOO FAR AND OF SPEAKING AS IF SHE HERSELF WERE PERFECTION ADDRESSINGERROR. SHE WAS TOO MUCH PREOCCUPIED WITH HER OWN ANXIETY TO BE AWARETHAT ROSAMOND WAS TREMBLING TOO AND FILLED WITH THE NEED TO EXPRESSPITYING FELLOWSHIP RATHER THAN REBUKE SHE PUT HER HANDS ON ROSAMONDSAND SAID WITH MORE AGITATED RAPIDITYI KNOW I KNOW THAT THE FEELINGMAY BE VERY DEARIT HAS TAKEN HOLD OF US UNAWARESIT IS SO HARD IT MAYSEEM LIKE DEATH TO PART WITH ITAND WE ARE WEAKI AM WEAKTHE WAVES OF HER OWN SORROW FROM OUT OF WHICH SHE WAS STRUGGLING TOSAVE ANOTHER RUSHED OVER DOROTHEA WITH CONQUERING FORCE. SHE STOPPEDIN SPEECHLESS AGITATION NOT CRYING BUT FEELING AS IF SHE WERE BEINGINWARDLY GRAPPLED. HER FACE HAD BECOME OF A DEATHLIER PALENESS HERLIPS TREMBLED AND SHE PRESSED HER HANDS HELPLESSLY ON THE HANDS THATLAY UNDER THEM.ROSAMOND TAKEN HOLD OF BY AN EMOTION STRONGER THAN HER OWNHURRIEDALONG IN A NEW MOVEMENT WHICH GAVE ALL THINGS SOME NEW AWFULUNDEFINED ASPECTCOULD FIND NO WORDS BUT INVOLUNTARILY SHE PUT HERLIPS TO DOROTHEAS FOREHEAD WHICH WAS VERY NEAR HER AND THEN FOR AMINUTE THE TWO WOMEN CLASPED EACH OTHER AS IF THEY HAD BEEN IN ASHIPWRECK.YOU ARE THINKING WHAT IS NOT TRUE SAID ROSAMOND IN AN EAGERHALFWHISPER WHILE SHE WAS STILL FEELING DOROTHEAS ARMS ROUNDHERURGED BY A MYSTERIOUS NECESSITY TO FREE HERSELF FROM SOMETHING THATOPPRESSED HER AS IF IT WERE BLOOD GUILTINESS.THEY MOVED APART LOOKING AT EACH OTHER.WHEN YOU CAME IN YESTERDAYIT WAS NOT AS YOU THOUGHT SAID ROSAMONDIN THE SAME TONE.THERE WAS A MOVEMENT OF SURPRISED ATTENTION IN DOROTHEA. SHE EXPECTED AVINDICATION OF ROSAMOND HERSELF.HE WAS TELLING ME HOW HE LOVED ANOTHER WOMAN THAT I MIGHT KNOW HECOULD NEVER LOVE ME SAID ROSAMOND GETTING MORE AND MORE HURRIED ASSHE WENT ON. AND NOW I THINK HE HATES ME BECAUSEBECAUSE YOU MISTOOKHIM YESTERDAY. HE SAYS IT IS THROUGH ME THAT YOU WILL THINK ILL OFHIMTHINK THAT HE IS A FALSE PERSON. BUT IT SHALL NOT BE THROUGH ME. HEHAS NEVER HAD ANY LOVE FOR MEI KNOW HE HAS NOTHE HAS ALWAYS THOUGHTSLIGHTLY OF ME. HE SAID YESTERDAY THAT NO OTHER WOMAN EXISTED FOR HIMBESIDE YOU. THE BLAME OF WHAT HAPPENED IS ENTIRELY MINE. HE SAID HECOULD NEVER EXPLAIN TO YOUBECAUSE OF ME. HE SAID YOU COULD NEVER THINKWELL OF HIM AGAIN. BUT NOW I HAVE TOLD YOU AND HE CANNOT REPROACH MEANY MORE.ROSAMOND HAD DELIVERED HER SOUL UNDER IMPULSES WHICH SHE HAD NOT KNOWNBEFORE. SHE HAD BEGUN HER CONFESSION UNDER THE SUBDUING INFLUENCE OFDOROTHEAS EMOTION AND AS SHE WENT ON SHE HAD GATHERED THE SENSE THATSHE WAS REPELLING WILLS REPROACHES WHICH WERE STILL LIKE AKNIFEWOUND WITHIN HER.THE REVULSION OF FEELING IN DOROTHEA WAS TOO STRONG TO BE CALLED JOY.IT WAS A TUMULT IN WHICH THE TERRIBLE STRAIN OF THE NIGHT AND MORNINGMADE A RESISTANT PAINSHE COULD ONLY PERCEIVE THAT THIS WOULD BE JOYWHEN SHE HAD RECOVERED HER POWER OF FEELING IT. HER IMMEDIATECONSCIOUSNESS WAS ONE OF IMMENSE SYMPATHY WITHOUT CHECK SHE CARED FORROSAMOND WITHOUT STRUGGLE NOW AND RESPONDED EARNESTLY TO HER LASTWORDSNO HE CANNOT REPROACH YOU ANY MORE.WITH HER USUAL TENDENCY TO OVERESTIMATE THE GOOD IN OTHERS SHE FELT AGREAT OUTGOING OF HER HEART TOWARDS ROSAMOND FOR THE GENEROUS EFFORTWHICH HAD REDEEMED HER FROM SUFFERING NOT COUNTING THAT THE EFFORT WASA REFLEX OF HER OWN ENERGY. AFTER THEY HAD BEEN SILENT A LITTLE SHESAIDYOU ARE NOT SORRY THAT I CAME THIS MORNINGNO YOU HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME SAID ROSAMOND. I DID NOT THINKTHAT YOU WOULD BE SO GOOD. I WAS VERY UNHAPPY. I AM NOT HAPPY NOW.EVERYTHING IS SO SAD.BUT BETTER DAYS WILL COME. YOUR HUSBAND WILL BE RIGHTLY VALUED. AND HEDEPENDS ON YOU FOR COMFORT. HE LOVES YOU BEST. THE WORST LOSS WOULD BETO LOSE THATAND YOU HAVE NOT LOST IT SAID DOROTHEA.SHE TRIED TO THRUST AWAY THE TOO OVERPOWERING THOUGHT OF HER OWNRELIEF LEST SHE SHOULD FAIL TO WIN SOME SIGN THAT ROSAMONDS AFFECTIONWAS YEARNING BACK TOWARDS HER HUSBAND.TERTIUS DID NOT FIND FAULT WITH ME THEN SAID ROSAMONDUNDERSTANDING NOW THAT LYDGATE MIGHT HAVE SAID ANYTHING TO MRS.CASAUBON AND THAT SHE CERTAINLY WAS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER WOMEN.PERHAPS THERE WAS A FAINT TASTE OF JEALOUSY IN THE QUESTION. A SMILEBEGAN TO PLAY OVER DOROTHEAS FACE AS SHE SAIDNO INDEED HOW COULD YOU IMAGINE IT BUT HERE THE DOOR OPENED ANDLYDGATE ENTERED.I AM COME BACK IN MY QUALITY OF DOCTOR HE SAID. AFTER I WENT AWAYI WAS HAUNTED BY TWO PALE FACES MRS. CASAUBON LOOKED AS MUCH IN NEEDOF CARE AS YOU ROSY. AND I THOUGHT THAT I HAD NOT DONE MY DUTY INLEAVING YOU TOGETHER SO WHEN I HAD BEEN TO COLEMANS I CAME HOMEAGAIN. I NOTICED THAT YOU WERE WALKING MRS. CASAUBON AND THE SKY HASCHANGEDI THINK WE MAY HAVE RAIN. MAY I SEND SOME ONE TO ORDER YOURCARRIAGE TO COME FOR YOUOH NO I AM STRONG I NEED THE WALK SAID DOROTHEA RISING WITHANIMATION IN HER FACE. MRS. LYDGATE AND I HAVE CHATTED A GREAT DEALAND IT IS TIME FOR ME TO GO. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ACCUSED OF BEINGIMMODERATE AND SAYING TOO MUCH.SHE PUT OUT HER HAND TO ROSAMOND AND THEY SAID AN EARNEST QUIETGOODBY WITHOUT KISS OR OTHER SHOW OF EFFUSION THERE HAD BEEN BETWEENTHEM TOO MUCH SERIOUS EMOTION FOR THEM TO USE THE SIGNS OF ITSUPERFICIALLY.AS LYDGATE TOOK HER TO THE DOOR SHE SAID NOTHING OF ROSAMOND BUT TOLDHIM OF MR. FAREBROTHER AND THE OTHER FRIENDS WHO HAD LISTENED WITHBELIEF TO HIS STORY.WHEN HE CAME BACK TO ROSAMOND SHE HAD ALREADY THROWN HERSELF ON THESOFA IN RESIGNED FATIGUE.WELL ROSY HE SAID STANDING OVER HER AND TOUCHING HER HAIR WHATDO YOU THINK OF MRS. CASAUBON NOW YOU HAVE SEEN SO MUCH OF HERI THINK SHE MUST BE BETTER THAN ANY ONE SAID ROSAMOND AND SHE ISVERY BEAUTIFUL. IF YOU GO TO TALK TO HER SO OFTEN YOU WILL BE MOREDISCONTENTED WITH ME THAN EVERLYDGATE LAUGHED AT THE SO OFTEN. BUT HAS SHE MADE YOU ANY LESSDISCONTENTED WITH MEI THINK SHE HAS SAID ROSAMOND LOOKING UP IN HIS FACE. HOW HEAVYYOUR EYES ARE TERTIUSAND DO PUSH YOUR HAIR BACK. HE LIFTED UP HISLARGE WHITE HAND TO OBEY HER AND FELT THANKFUL FOR THIS LITTLE MARK OFINTEREST IN HIM. POOR ROSAMONDS VAGRANT FANCY HAD COME BACK TERRIBLYSCOURGEDMEEK ENOUGH TO NESTLE UNDER THE OLD DESPISED SHELTER. AND THESHELTER WAS STILL THERE LYDGATE HAD ACCEPTED HIS NARROWED LOT WITH SADRESIGNATION. HE HAD CHOSEN THIS FRAGILE CREATURE AND HAD TAKEN THEBURTHEN OF HER LIFE UPON HIS ARMS. HE MUST WALK AS HE COULD CARRYINGTHAT BURTHEN PITIFULLY.CHAPTER LXXXII.MY GRIEF LIES ONWARD AND MY JOY BEHIND.SHAKESPEARE SONNETS.EXILES NOTORIOUSLY FEED MUCH ON HOPES AND ARE UNLIKELY TO STAY INBANISHMENT UNLESS THEY ARE OBLIGED. WHEN WILL LADISLAW EXILED HIMSELFFROM MIDDLEMARCH HE HAD PLACED NO STRONGER OBSTACLE TO HIS RETURN THANHIS OWN RESOLVE WHICH WAS BY NO MEANS AN IRON BARRIER BUT SIMPLY ASTATE OF MIND LIABLE TO MELT INTO A MINUET WITH OTHER STATES OF MINDAND TO FIND ITSELF BOWING SMILING AND GIVING PLACE WITH POLITEFACILITY. AS THE MONTHS WENT ON IT HAD SEEMED MORE AND MORE DIFFICULTTO HIM TO SAY WHY HE SHOULD NOT RUN DOWN TO MIDDLEMARCHMERELY FOR THESAKE OF HEARING SOMETHING ABOUT DOROTHEA AND IF ON SUCH A FLYING VISITHE SHOULD CHANCE BY SOME STRANGE COINCIDENCE TO MEET WITH HER THEREWAS NO REASON FOR HIM TO BE ASHAMED OF HAVING TAKEN AN INNOCENT JOURNEYWHICH HE HAD BEFOREHAND SUPPOSED THAT HE SHOULD NOT TAKE. SINCE HE WASHOPELESSLY DIVIDED FROM HER HE MIGHT SURELY VENTURE INTO HERNEIGHBORHOOD AND AS TO THE SUSPICIOUS FRIENDS WHO KEPT A DRAGON WATCHOVER HERTHEIR OPINIONS SEEMED LESS AND LESS IMPORTANT WITH TIME ANDCHANGE OF AIR.AND THERE HAD COME A REASON QUITE IRRESPECTIVE OF DOROTHEA WHICHSEEMED TO MAKE A JOURNEY TO MIDDLEMARCH A SORT OF PHILANTHROPIC DUTY.WILL HAD GIVEN A DISINTERESTED ATTENTION TO AN INTENDED SETTLEMENT ON ANEW PLAN IN THE FAR WEST AND THE NEED FOR FUNDS IN ORDER TO CARRY OUTA GOOD DESIGN HAD SET HIM ON DEBATING WITH HIMSELF WHETHER IT WOULD NOTBE A LAUDABLE USE TO MAKE OF HIS CLAIM ON BULSTRODE TO URGE THEAPPLICATION OF THAT MONEY WHICH HAD BEEN OFFERED TO HIMSELF AS A MEANSOF CARRYING OUT A SCHEME LIKELY TO BE LARGELY BENEFICIAL. THE QUESTIONSEEMED A VERY DUBIOUS ONE TO WILL AND HIS REPUGNANCE TO AGAIN ENTERINGINTO ANY RELATION WITH THE BANKER MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM DISMISS ITQUICKLY IF THERE HAD NOT ARISEN IN HIS IMAGINATION THE PROBABILITYTHAT HIS JUDGMENT MIGHT BE MORE SAFELY DETERMINED BY A VISIT TOMIDDLEMARCH.THAT WAS THE OBJECT WHICH WILL STATED TO HIMSELF AS A REASON FOR COMINGDOWN. HE HAD MEANT TO CONFIDE IN LYDGATE AND DISCUSS THE MONEYQUESTION WITH HIM AND HE HAD MEANT TO AMUSE HIMSELF FOR THE FEWEVENINGS OF HIS STAY BY HAVING A GREAT DEAL OF MUSIC AND BADINAGE WITHFAIR ROSAMOND WITHOUT NEGLECTING HIS FRIENDS AT LOWICK PARSONAGEIFTHE PARSONAGE WAS CLOSE TO THE MANOR THAT WAS NO FAULT OF HIS. HE HADNEGLECTED THE FAREBROTHERS BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE FROM A PROUDRESISTANCE TO THE POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INDIRECTLY SEEKING INTERVIEWSWITH DOROTHEA BUT HUNGER TAMES US AND WILL HAD BECOME VERY HUNGRY FORTHE VISION OF A CERTAIN FORM AND THE SOUND OF A CERTAIN VOICE. NOTHINGHAD DONE INSTEADNOT THE OPERA OR THE CONVERSE OF ZEALOUS POLITICIANSOR THE FLATTERING RECEPTION IN DIM CORNERS OF HIS NEW HAND IN LEADINGARTICLES.THUS HE HAD COME DOWN FORESEEING WITH CONFIDENCE HOW ALMOST EVERYTHINGWOULD BE IN HIS FAMILIAR LITTLE WORLD FEARING INDEED THAT THEREWOULD BE NO SURPRISES IN HIS VISIT. BUT HE HAD FOUND THAT HUMDRUM WORLDIN A TERRIBLY DYNAMIC CONDITION IN WHICH EVEN BADINAGE AND LYRISM HADTURNED EXPLOSIVE AND THE FIRST DAY OF THIS VISIT HAD BECOME THE MOSTFATAL EPOCH OF HIS LIFE. THE NEXT MORNING HE FELT SO HARASSED WITH THENIGHTMARE OF CONSEQUENCESHE DREADED SO MUCH THE IMMEDIATE ISSUESBEFORE HIMTHAT SEEING WHILE HE BREAKFASTED THE ARRIVAL OF THERIVERSTON COACH HE WENT OUT HURRIEDLY AND TOOK HIS PLACE ON IT THATHE MIGHT BE RELIEVED AT LEAST FOR A DAY FROM THE NECESSITY OF DOINGOR SAYING ANYTHING IN MIDDLEMARCH. WILL LADISLAW WAS IN ONE OF THOSETANGLED CRISES WHICH ARE COMMONER IN EXPERIENCE THAN ONE MIGHT IMAGINEFROM THE SHALLOW ABSOLUTENESS OF MENS JUDGMENTS. HE HAD FOUND LYDGATEFOR WHOM HE HAD THE SINCEREST RESPECT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICHCLAIMED HIS THOROUGH AND FRANKLY DECLARED SYMPATHY AND THE REASON WHYIN SPITE OF THAT CLAIM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR WILL TO HAVEAVOIDED ALL FURTHER INTIMACY OR EVEN CONTACT WITH LYDGATE WASPRECISELY OF THE KIND TO MAKE SUCH A COURSE APPEAR IMPOSSIBLE. TO ACREATURE OF WILLS SUSCEPTIBLE TEMPERAMENTWITHOUT ANY NEUTRAL REGIONOF INDIFFERENCE IN HIS NATURE READY TO TURN EVERYTHING THAT BEFELL HIMINTO THE COLLISIONS OF A PASSIONATE DRAMATHE REVELATION THAT ROSAMONDHAD MADE HER HAPPINESS IN ANY WAY DEPENDENT ON HIM WAS A DIFFICULTYWHICH HIS OUTBURST OF RAGE TOWARDS HER HAD IMMEASURABLY INCREASED FORHIM. HE HATED HIS OWN CRUELTY AND YET HE DREADED TO SHOW THE FULNESSOF HIS RELENTING HE MUST GO TO HER AGAIN THE FRIENDSHIP COULD NOT BEPUT TO A SUDDEN END AND HER UNHAPPINESS WAS A POWER WHICH HE DREADED.AND ALL THE WHILE THERE WAS NO MORE FORETASTE OF ENJOYMENT IN THE LIFEBEFORE HIM THAN IF HIS LIMBS HAD BEEN LOPPED OFF AND HE WAS MAKING HISFRESH START ON CRUTCHES. IN THE NIGHT HE HAD DEBATED WHETHER HE SHOULDNOT GET ON THE COACH NOT FOR RIVERSTON BUT FOR LONDON LEAVING A NOTETO LYDGATE WHICH WOULD GIVE A MAKESHIFT REASON FOR HIS RETREAT. BUTTHERE WERE STRONG CORDS PULLING HIM BACK FROM THAT ABRUPT DEPARTURETHE BLIGHT ON HIS HAPPINESS IN THINKING OF DOROTHEA THE CRUSHING OFTHAT CHIEF HOPE WHICH HAD REMAINED IN SPITE OF THE ACKNOWLEDGEDNECESSITY FOR RENUNCIATION WAS TOO FRESH A MISERY FOR HIM TO RESIGNHIMSELF TO IT AND GO STRAIGHTWAY INTO A DISTANCE WHICH WAS ALSODESPAIR.THUS HE DID NOTHING MORE DECIDED THAN TAKING THE RIVERSTON COACH. HECAME BACK AGAIN BY IT WHILE IT WAS STILL DAYLIGHT HAVING MADE UP HISMIND THAT HE MUST GO TO LYDGATES THAT EVENING. THE RUBICON WE KNOWWAS A VERY INSIGNIFICANT STREAM TO LOOK AT ITS SIGNIFICANCE LAYENTIRELY IN CERTAIN INVISIBLE CONDITIONS. WILL FELT AS IF HE WEREFORCED TO CROSS HIS SMALL BOUNDARY DITCH AND WHAT HE SAW BEYOND IT WASNOT EMPIRE BUT DISCONTENTED SUBJECTION.BUT IT IS GIVEN TO US SOMETIMES EVEN IN OUR EVERYDAY LIFE TO WITNESSTHE SAVING INFLUENCE OF A NOBLE NATURE THE DIVINE EFFICACY OF RESCUETHAT MAY LIE IN A SELFSUBDUING ACT OF FELLOWSHIP. IF DOROTHEA AFTERHER NIGHTS ANGUISH HAD NOT TAKEN THAT WALK TO ROSAMONDWHY SHEPERHAPS WOULD HAVE BEEN A WOMAN WHO GAINED A HIGHER CHARACTER FORDISCRETION BUT IT WOULD CERTAINLY NOT HAVE BEEN AS WELL FOR THOSETHREE WHO WERE ON ONE HEARTH IN LYDGATES HOUSE AT HALFPAST SEVEN THATEVENING.ROSAMOND HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR WILLS VISIT AND SHE RECEIVED HIM WITHA LANGUID COLDNESS WHICH LYDGATE ACCOUNTED FOR BY HER NERVOUSEXHAUSTION OF WHICH HE COULD NOT SUPPOSE THAT IT HAD ANY RELATION TOWILL. AND WHEN SHE SAT IN SILENCE BENDING OVER A BIT OF WORK HEINNOCENTLY APOLOGIZED FOR HER IN AN INDIRECT WAY BY BEGGING HER TO LEANBACKWARD AND REST. WILL WAS MISERABLE IN THE NECESSITY FOR PLAYING THEPART OF A FRIEND WHO WAS MAKING HIS FIRST APPEARANCE AND GREETING TOROSAMOND WHILE HIS THOUGHTS WERE BUSY ABOUT HER FEELING SINCE THATSCENE OF YESTERDAY WHICH SEEMED STILL INEXORABLY TO ENCLOSE THEM BOTHLIKE THE PAINFUL VISION OF A DOUBLE MADNESS. IT HAPPENED THAT NOTHINGCALLED LYDGATE OUT OF THE ROOM BUT WHEN ROSAMOND POURED OUT THE TEAAND WILL CAME NEAR TO FETCH IT SHE PLACED A TINY BIT OF FOLDED PAPERIN HIS SAUCER. HE SAW IT AND SECURED IT QUICKLY BUT AS HE WENT BACK TOHIS INN HE HAD NO EAGERNESS TO UNFOLD THE PAPER. WHAT ROSAMOND HADWRITTEN TO HIM WOULD PROBABLY DEEPEN THE PAINFUL IMPRESSIONS OF THEEVENING. STILL HE OPENED AND READ IT BY HIS BEDCANDLE. THERE WEREONLY THESE FEW WORDS IN HER NEATLY FLOWING HANDI HAVE TOLD MRS. CASAUBON. SHE IS NOT UNDER ANY MISTAKE ABOUT YOU. ITOLD HER BECAUSE SHE CAME TO SEE ME AND WAS VERY KIND. YOU WILL HAVENOTHING TO REPROACH ME WITH NOW. I SHALL NOT HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCETO YOU.THE EFFECT OF THESE WORDS WAS NOT QUITE ALL GLADNESS. AS WILL DWELT ONTHEM WITH EXCITED IMAGINATION HE FELT HIS CHEEKS AND EARS BURNING ATTHE THOUGHT OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED BETWEEN DOROTHEA AND ROSAMONDAT THEUNCERTAINTY HOW FAR DOROTHEA MIGHT STILL FEEL HER DIGNITY WOUNDED INHAVING AN EXPLANATION OF HIS CONDUCT OFFERED TO HER. THERE MIGHT STILLREMAIN IN HER MIND A CHANGED ASSOCIATION WITH HIM WHICH MADE ANIRREMEDIABLE DIFFERENCEA LASTING FLAW. WITH ACTIVE FANCY HE WROUGHTHIMSELF INTO A STATE OF DOUBT LITTLE MORE EASY THAN THAT OF THE MAN WHOHAS ESCAPED FROM WRECK BY NIGHT AND STANDS ON UNKNOWN GROUND IN THEDARKNESS. UNTIL THAT WRETCHED YESTERDAYEXCEPT THE MOMENT OF VEXATIONLONG AGO IN THE VERY SAME ROOM AND IN THE VERY SAME PRESENCEALL THEIRVISION ALL THEIR THOUGHT OF EACH OTHER HAD BEEN AS IN A WORLD APARTWHERE THE SUNSHINE FELL ON TALL WHITE LILIES WHERE NO EVIL LURKED ANDNO OTHER SOUL ENTERED. BUT NOWWOULD DOROTHEA MEET HIM IN THAT WORLDAGAINCHAPTER LXXXIII.AND NOW GOODMORROW TO OUR WAKING SOULSWHICH WATCH NOT ONE ANOTHER OUT OF FEARFOR LOVE ALL LOVE OF OTHER SIGHTS CONTROLSAND MAKES ONE LITTLE ROOM AN EVERYWHERE.DR. DONNE.ON THE SECOND MORNING AFTER DOROTHEAS VISIT TO ROSAMOND SHE HAD HADTWO NIGHTS OF SOUND SLEEP AND HAD NOT ONLY LOST ALL TRACES OF FATIGUEBUT FELT AS IF SHE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF SUPERFLUOUS STRENGTHTHAT IS TOSAY MORE STRENGTH THAN SHE COULD MANAGE TO CONCENTRATE ON ANYOCCUPATION. THE DAY BEFORE SHE HAD TAKEN LONG WALKS OUTSIDE THEGROUNDS AND HAD PAID TWO VISITS TO THE PARSONAGE BUT SHE NEVER IN HERLIFE TOLD ANY ONE THE REASON WHY SHE SPENT HER TIME IN THAT FRUITLESSMANNER AND THIS MORNING SHE WAS RATHER ANGRY WITH HERSELF FOR HERCHILDISH RESTLESSNESS. TODAY WAS TO BE SPENT QUITE DIFFERENTLY. WHATWAS THERE TO BE DONE IN THE VILLAGE OH DEAR NOTHING. EVERYBODY WASWELL AND HAD FLANNEL NOBODYS PIG HAD DIED AND IT WAS SATURDAYMORNING WHEN THERE WAS A GENERAL SCRUBBING OF DOORS AND DOORSTONESAND WHEN IT WAS USELESS TO GO INTO THE SCHOOL. BUT THERE WERE VARIOUSSUBJECTS THAT DOROTHEA WAS TRYING TO GET CLEAR UPON AND SHE RESOLVEDTO THROW HERSELF ENERGETICALLY INTO THE GRAVEST OF ALL. SHE SAT DOWN INTHE LIBRARY BEFORE HER PARTICULAR LITTLE HEAP OF BOOKS ON POLITICALECONOMY AND KINDRED MATTERS OUT OF WHICH SHE WAS TRYING TO GET LIGHTAS TO THE BEST WAY OF SPENDING MONEY SO AS NOT TO INJURE ONESNEIGHBORS ORWHAT COMES TO THE SAME THINGSO AS TO DO THEM THE MOSTGOOD. HERE WAS A WEIGHTY SUBJECT WHICH IF SHE COULD BUT LAY HOLD OFIT WOULD CERTAINLY KEEP HER MIND STEADY. UNHAPPILY HER MIND SLIPPEDOFF IT FOR A WHOLE HOUR AND AT THE END SHE FOUND HERSELF READINGSENTENCES TWICE OVER WITH AN INTENSE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MANY THINGS BUTNOT OF ANY ONE THING CONTAINED IN THE TEXT. THIS WAS HOPELESS. SHOULDSHE ORDER THE CARRIAGE AND DRIVE TO TIPTON NO FOR SOME REASON OROTHER SHE PREFERRED STAYING AT LOWICK. BUT HER VAGRANT MIND MUST BEREDUCED TO ORDER THERE WAS AN ART IN SELFDISCIPLINE AND SHE WALKEDROUND AND ROUND THE BROWN LIBRARY CONSIDERING BY WHAT SORT OF MANOEUVRESHE COULD ARREST HER WANDERING THOUGHTS. PERHAPS A MERE TASK WAS THEBEST MEANSSOMETHING TO WHICH SHE MUST GO DOGGEDLY. WAS THERE NOT THEGEOGRAPHY OF ASIA MINOR IN WHICH HER SLACKNESS HAD OFTEN BEEN REBUKEDBY MR. CASAUBON SHE WENT TO THE CABINET OF MAPS AND UNROLLED ONE THISMORNING SHE MIGHT MAKE HERSELF FINALLY SURE THAT PAPHLAGONIA WAS NOT ONTHE LEVANTINE COAST AND FIX HER TOTAL DARKNESS ABOUT THE CHALYBESFIRMLY ON THE SHORES OF THE EUXINE. A MAP WAS A FINE THING TO STUDYWHEN YOU WERE DISPOSED TO THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE BEING MADE UP OFNAMES THAT WOULD TURN INTO A CHIME IF YOU WENT BACK UPON THEM. DOROTHEASET EARNESTLY TO WORK BENDING CLOSE TO HER MAP AND UTTERING THE NAMESIN AN AUDIBLE SUBDUED TONE WHICH OFTEN GOT INTO A CHIME. SHE LOOKEDAMUSINGLY GIRLISH AFTER ALL HER DEEP EXPERIENCENODDING HER HEAD ANDMARKING THE NAMES OFF ON HER FINGERS WITH A LITTLE PURSING OF HER LIPAND NOW AND THEN BREAKING OFF TO PUT HER HANDS ON EACH SIDE OF HER FACEAND SAY OH DEAR OH DEARTHERE WAS NO REASON WHY THIS SHOULD END ANY MORE THAN A MERRYGOROUNDBUT IT WAS AT LAST INTERRUPTED BY THE OPENING OF THE DOOR AND THEANNOUNCEMENT OF MISS NOBLE.THE LITTLE OLD LADY WHOSE BONNET HARDLY REACHED DOROTHEAS SHOULDERWAS WARMLY WELCOMED BUT WHILE HER HAND WAS BEING PRESSED SHE MADE MANYOF HER BEAVERLIKE NOISES AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING DIFFICULT TO SAY.DO SIT DOWN SAID DOROTHEA ROLLING A CHAIR FORWARD. AM I WANTED FORANYTHING I SHALL BE SO GLAD IF I CAN DO ANYTHING.I WILL NOT STAY SAID MISS NOBLE PUTTING HER HAND INTO HER SMALLBASKET AND HOLDING SOME ARTICLE INSIDE IT NERVOUSLY I HAVE LEFT AFRIEND IN THE CHURCHYARD. SHE LAPSED INTO HER INARTICULATE SOUNDS ANDUNCONSCIOUSLY DREW FORTH THE ARTICLE WHICH SHE WAS FINGERING. IT WASTHE TORTOISESHELL LOZENGEBOX AND DOROTHEA FELT THE COLOR MOUNTING TOHER CHEEKS.MR. LADISLAW CONTINUED THE TIMID LITTLE WOMAN. HE FEARS HE HASOFFENDED YOU AND HAS BEGGED ME TO ASK IF YOU WILL SEE HIM FOR A FEWMINUTES.DOROTHEA DID NOT ANSWER ON THE INSTANT IT WAS CROSSING HER MIND THATSHE COULD NOT RECEIVE HIM IN THIS LIBRARY WHERE HER HUSBANDSPROHIBITION SEEMED TO DWELL. SHE LOOKED TOWARDS THE WINDOW. COULD SHEGO OUT AND MEET HIM IN THE GROUNDS THE SKY WAS HEAVY AND THE TREESHAD BEGUN TO SHIVER AS AT A COMING STORM. BESIDES SHE SHRANK FROMGOING OUT TO HIM.DO SEE HIM MRS. CASAUBON SAID MISS NOBLE PATHETICALLY ELSE IMUST GO BACK AND SAY NO AND THAT WILL HURT HIM.YES I WILL SEE HIM SAID DOROTHEA. PRAY TELL HIM TO COME.WHAT ELSE WAS THERE TO BE DONE THERE WAS NOTHING THAT SHE LONGED FORAT THAT MOMENT EXCEPT TO SEE WILL THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM HADTHRUST ITSELF INSISTENTLY BETWEEN HER AND EVERY OTHER OBJECT AND YETSHE HAD A THROBBING EXCITEMENT LIKE AN ALARM UPON HERA SENSE THAT SHEWAS DOING SOMETHING DARINGLY DEFIANT FOR HIS SAKE.WHEN THE LITTLE LADY HAD TROTTED AWAY ON HER MISSION DOROTHEA STOOD INTHE MIDDLE OF THE LIBRARY WITH HER HANDS FALLING CLASPED BEFORE HERMAKING NO ATTEMPT TO COMPOSE HERSELF IN AN ATTITUDE OF DIGNIFIEDUNCONSCIOUSNESS. WHAT SHE WAS LEAST CONSCIOUS OF JUST THEN WAS HER OWNBODY SHE WAS THINKING OF WHAT WAS LIKELY TO BE IN WILLS MIND AND OFTHE HARD FEELINGS THAT OTHERS HAD HAD ABOUT HIM. HOW COULD ANY DUTYBIND HER TO HARDNESS RESISTANCE TO UNJUST DISPRAISE HAD MINGLED WITHHER FEELING FOR HIM FROM THE VERY FIRST AND NOW IN THE REBOUND OF HERHEART AFTER HER ANGUISH THE RESISTANCE WAS STRONGER THAN EVER. IF ILOVE HIM TOO MUCH IT IS BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN USED SO ILLTHERE WAS AVOICE WITHIN HER SAYING THIS TO SOME IMAGINED AUDIENCE IN THE LIBRARYWHEN THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND SHE SAW WILL BEFORE HER.SHE DID NOT MOVE AND HE CAME TOWARDS HER WITH MORE DOUBT AND TIMIDITYIN HIS FACE THAN SHE HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE. HE WAS IN A STATE OFUNCERTAINTY WHICH MADE HIM AFRAID LEST SOME LOOK OR WORD OF HIS SHOULDCONDEMN HIM TO A NEW DISTANCE FROM HER AND DOROTHEA WAS AFRAID OF HEROWN EMOTION. SHE LOOKED AS IF THERE WERE A SPELL UPON HER KEEPINGHER MOTIONLESS AND HINDERING HER FROM UNCLASPING HER HANDS WHILE SOMEINTENSE GRAVE YEARNING WAS IMPRISONED WITHIN HER EYES. SEEING THAT SHEDID NOT PUT OUT HER HAND AS USUAL WILL PAUSED A YARD FROM HER AND SAIDWITH EMBARRASSMENT I AM SO GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR SEEING ME.I WANTED TO SEE YOU SAID DOROTHEA HAVING NO OTHER WORDS AT COMMAND.IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HER TO SIT DOWN AND WILL DID NOT GIVE A CHEERFULINTERPRETATION TO THIS QUEENLY WAY OF RECEIVING HIM BUT HE WENT ON TOSAY WHAT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO SAY.I FEAR YOU THINK ME FOOLISH AND PERHAPS WRONG FOR COMING BACK SO SOON.I HAVE BEEN PUNISHED FOR MY IMPATIENCE. YOU KNOWEVERY ONE KNOWS NOWAPAINFUL STORY ABOUT MY PARENTAGE. I KNEW OF IT BEFORE I WENT AWAY ANDI ALWAYS MEANT TO TELL YOU OF IT IFIF WE EVER MET AGAIN.THERE WAS A SLIGHT MOVEMENT IN DOROTHEA AND SHE UNCLASPED HER HANDSBUT IMMEDIATELY FOLDED THEM OVER EACH OTHER.BUT THE AFFAIR IS MATTER OF GOSSIP NOW WILL CONTINUED. I WISHED YOUTO KNOW THAT SOMETHING CONNECTED WITH ITSOMETHING WHICH HAPPENEDBEFORE I WENT AWAY HELPED TO BRING ME DOWN HERE AGAIN. AT LEAST ITHOUGHT IT EXCUSED MY COMING. IT WAS THE IDEA OF GETTING BULSTRODE TOAPPLY SOME MONEY TO A PUBLIC PURPOSESOME MONEY WHICH HE HAD THOUGHT OFGIVING ME. PERHAPS IT IS RATHER TO BULSTRODES CREDIT THAT HE PRIVATELYOFFERED ME COMPENSATION FOR AN OLD INJURY HE OFFERED TO GIVE ME A GOODINCOME TO MAKE AMENDS BUT I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW THE DISAGREEABLE STORYWILL LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT DOROTHEA BUT HIS MANNER WAS GATHERING SOMEOF THE DEFIANT COURAGE WITH WHICH HE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF THIS FACT IN HISDESTINY. HE ADDED YOU KNOW THAT IT MUST BE ALTOGETHER PAINFUL TO ME.YESYESI KNOW SAID DOROTHEA HASTILY.I DID NOT CHOOSE TO ACCEPT AN INCOME FROM SUCH A SOURCE. I WAS SURETHAT YOU WOULD NOT THINK WELL OF ME IF I DID SO SAID WILL. WHY SHOULDHE MIND SAYING ANYTHING OF THAT SORT TO HER NOW SHE KNEW THAT HE HADAVOWED HIS LOVE FOR HER. I FELT THATHE BROKE OFF NEVERTHELESS.YOU ACTED AS I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED YOU TO ACT SAID DOROTHEA HERFACE BRIGHTENING AND HER HEAD BECOMING A LITTLE MORE ERECT ON ITSBEAUTIFUL STEM.I DID NOT BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD LET ANY CIRCUMSTANCE OF MY BIRTHCREATE A PREJUDICE IN YOU AGAINST ME THOUGH IT WAS SURE TO DO SO INOTHERS SAID WILL SHAKING HIS HEAD BACKWARD IN HIS OLD WAY ANDLOOKING WITH A GRAVE APPEAL INTO HER EYES.IF IT WERE A NEW HARDSHIP IT WOULD BE A NEW REASON FOR ME TO CLING TOYOU SAID DOROTHEA FERVIDLY. NOTHING COULD HAVE CHANGED ME BUT HERHEART WAS SWELLING AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GO ON SHE MADE A GREATEFFORT OVER HERSELF TO SAY IN A LOW TREMULOUS VOICE BUT THINKING THATYOU WERE DIFFERENTNOT SO GOOD AS I HAD BELIEVED YOU TO BE.YOU ARE SURE TO BELIEVE ME BETTER THAN I AM IN EVERYTHING BUT ONESAID WILL GIVING WAY TO HIS OWN FEELING IN THE EVIDENCE OF HERS. IMEAN IN MY TRUTH TO YOU. WHEN I THOUGHT YOU DOUBTED OF THAT I DIDNTCARE ABOUT ANYTHING THAT WAS LEFT. I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL OVER WITH MEAND THERE WAS NOTHING TO TRY FORONLY THINGS TO ENDURE.I DONT DOUBT YOU ANY LONGER SAID DOROTHEA PUTTING OUT HER HAND AVAGUE FEAR FOR HIM IMPELLING HER UNUTTERABLE AFFECTION.HE TOOK HER HAND AND RAISED IT TO HIS LIPS WITH SOMETHING LIKE A SOB.BUT HE STOOD WITH HIS HAT AND GLOVES IN THE OTHER HAND AND MIGHT HAVEDONE FOR THE PORTRAIT OF A ROYALIST. STILL IT WAS DIFFICULT TO LOOSETHE HAND AND DOROTHEA WITHDRAWING IT IN A CONFUSION THAT DISTRESSEDHER LOOKED AND MOVED AWAY.SEE HOW DARK THE CLOUDS HAVE BECOME AND HOW THE TREES ARE TOSSEDSHE SAID WALKING TOWARDS THE WINDOW YET SPEAKING AND MOVING WITH ONLYA DIM SENSE OF WHAT SHE WAS DOING.WILL FOLLOWED HER AT A LITTLE DISTANCE AND LEANED AGAINST THE TALLBACK OF A LEATHER CHAIR ON WHICH HE VENTURED NOW TO LAY HIS HAT ANDGLOVES AND FREE HIMSELF FROM THE INTOLERABLE DURANCE OF FORMALITY TOWHICH HE HAD BEEN FOR THE FIRST TIME CONDEMNED IN DOROTHEAS PRESENCE.IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT HE FELT VERY HAPPY AT THAT MOMENT LEANING ONTHE CHAIR. HE WAS NOT MUCH AFRAID OF ANYTHING THAT SHE MIGHT FEEL NOW.THEY STOOD SILENT NOT LOOKING AT EACH OTHER BUT LOOKING AT THEEVERGREENS WHICH WERE BEING TOSSED AND WERE SHOWING THE PALE UNDERSIDEOF THEIR LEAVES AGAINST THE BLACKENING SKY. WILL NEVER ENJOYED THEPROSPECT OF A STORM SO MUCH IT DELIVERED HIM FROM THE NECESSITY OFGOING AWAY. LEAVES AND LITTLE BRANCHES WERE HURLED ABOUT AND THETHUNDER WAS GETTING NEARER. THE LIGHT WAS MORE AND MORE SOMBRE BUTTHERE CAME A FLASH OF LIGHTNING WHICH MADE THEM START AND LOOK AT EACHOTHER AND THEN SMILE. DOROTHEA BEGAN TO SAY WHAT SHE HAD BEEN THINKINGOF.THAT WAS A WRONG THING FOR YOU TO SAY THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHINGTO TRY FOR. IF WE HAD LOST OUR OWN CHIEF GOOD OTHER PEOPLES GOODWOULD REMAIN AND THAT IS WORTH TRYING FOR. SOME CAN BE HAPPY. I SEEMEDTO SEE THAT MORE CLEARLY THAN EVER WHEN I WAS THE MOST WRETCHED. I CANHARDLY THINK HOW I COULD HAVE BORNE THE TROUBLE IF THAT FEELING HADNOT COME TO ME TO MAKE STRENGTH.YOU HAVE NEVER FELT THE SORT OF MISERY I FELT SAID WILL THE MISERYOF KNOWING THAT YOU MUST DESPISE ME.BUT I HAVE FELT WORSEIT WAS WORSE TO THINK ILL DOROTHEA HAD BEGUNIMPETUOUSLY BUT BROKE OFF.WILL COLORED. HE HAD THE SENSE THAT WHATEVER SHE SAID WAS UTTERED INTHE VISION OF A FATALITY THAT KEPT THEM APART. HE WAS SILENT A MOMENTAND THEN SAID PASSIONATELYWE MAY AT LEAST HAVE THE COMFORT OF SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER WITHOUTDISGUISE. SINCE I MUST GO AWAYSINCE WE MUST ALWAYS BE DIVIDEDYOU MAYTHINK OF ME AS ONE ON THE BRINK OF THE GRAVE.WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING THERE CAME A VIVID FLASH OF LIGHTNING WHICH LITEACH OF THEM UP FOR THE OTHERAND THE LIGHT SEEMED TO BE THE TERROR OFA HOPELESS LOVE. DOROTHEA DARTED INSTANTANEOUSLY FROM THE WINDOW WILLFOLLOWED HER SEIZING HER HAND WITH A SPASMODIC MOVEMENT AND SO THEYSTOOD WITH THEIR HANDS CLASPED LIKE TWO CHILDREN LOOKING OUT ON THESTORM WHILE THE THUNDER GAVE A TREMENDOUS CRACK AND ROLL ABOVE THEMAND THE RAIN BEGAN TO POUR DOWN. THEN THEY TURNED THEIR FACES TOWARDSEACH OTHER WITH THE MEMORY OF HIS LAST WORDS IN THEM AND THEY DID NOTLOOSE EACH OTHERS HANDS.THERE IS NO HOPE FOR ME SAID WILL. EVEN IF YOU LOVED ME AS WELL ASI LOVE YOUEVEN IF I WERE EVERYTHING TO YOUI SHALL MOST LIKELY ALWAYSBE VERY POOR ON A SOBER CALCULATION ONE CAN COUNT ON NOTHING BUT ACREEPING LOT. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US EVER TO BELONG TO EACH OTHER. ITIS PERHAPS BASE OF ME TO HAVE ASKED FOR A WORD FROM YOU. I MEANT TO GOAWAY INTO SILENCE BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO WHAT I MEANT.DONT BE SORRY SAID DOROTHEA IN HER CLEAR TENDER TONES. I WOULDRATHER SHARE ALL THE TROUBLE OF OUR PARTING.HER LIPS TREMBLED AND SO DID HIS. IT WAS NEVER KNOWN WHICH LIPS WERETHE FIRST TO MOVE TOWARDS THE OTHER LIPS BUT THEY KISSED TREMBLINGLYAND THEN THEY MOVED APART.THE RAIN WAS DASHING AGAINST THE WINDOWPANES AS IF AN ANGRY SPIRITWERE WITHIN IT AND BEHIND IT WAS THE GREAT SWOOP OF THE WIND IT WASONE OF THOSE MOMENTS IN WHICH BOTH THE BUSY AND THE IDLE PAUSE WITH ACERTAIN AWE.DOROTHEA SAT DOWN ON THE SEAT NEAREST TO HER A LONG LOW OTTOMAN IN THEMIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND WITH HER HANDS FOLDED OVER EACH OTHER ON HERLAP LOOKED AT THE DREAR OUTER WORLD. WILL STOOD STILL AN INSTANTLOOKING AT HER THEN SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE HER AND LAID HIS HAND ONHERS WHICH TURNED ITSELF UPWARD TO BE CLASPED. THEY SAT IN THAT WAYWITHOUT LOOKING AT EACH OTHER UNTIL THE RAIN ABATED AND BEGAN TO FALLIN STILLNESS. EACH HAD BEEN FULL OF THOUGHTS WHICH NEITHER OF THEMCOULD BEGIN TO UTTER.BUT WHEN THE RAIN WAS QUIET DOROTHEA TURNED TO LOOK AT WILL. WITHPASSIONATE EXCLAMATION AS IF SOME TORTURE SCREW WERE THREATENING HIMHE STARTED UP AND SAID IT IS IMPOSSIBLEHE WENT AND LEANED ON THE BACK OF THE CHAIR AGAIN AND SEEMED TO BEBATTLING WITH HIS OWN ANGER WHILE SHE LOOKED TOWARDS HIM SADLY.IT IS AS FATAL AS A MURDER OR ANY OTHER HORROR THAT DIVIDES PEOPLEHE BURST OUT AGAIN IT IS MORE INTOLERABLETO HAVE OUR LIFE MAIMED BYPETTY ACCIDENTS.NODONT SAY THATYOUR LIFE NEED NOT BE MAIMED SAID DOROTHEAGENTLY.YES IT MUST SAID WILL ANGRILY. IT IS CRUEL OF YOU TO SPEAK INTHAT WAYAS IF THERE WERE ANY COMFORT. YOU MAY SEE BEYOND THE MISERY OFIT BUT I DONT. IT IS UNKINDIT IS THROWING BACK MY LOVE FOR YOU AS IFIT WERE A TRIFLE TO SPEAK IN THAT WAY IN THE FACE OF THE FACT. WE CANNEVER BE MARRIED.SOME TIMEWE MIGHT SAID DOROTHEA IN A TREMBLING VOICE.WHEN SAID WILL BITTERLY. WHAT IS THE USE OF COUNTING ON ANYSUCCESS OF MINE IT IS A MERE TOSS UP WHETHER I SHALL EVER DO MORE THANKEEP MYSELF DECENTLY UNLESS I CHOOSE TO SELL MYSELF AS A MERE PEN ANDA MOUTHPIECE. I CAN SEE THAT CLEARLY ENOUGH. I COULD NOT OFFER MYSELFTO ANY WOMAN EVEN IF SHE HAD NO LUXURIES TO RENOUNCE.THERE WAS SILENCE. DOROTHEAS HEART WAS FULL OF SOMETHING THAT SHEWANTED TO SAY AND YET THE WORDS WERE TOO DIFFICULT. SHE WAS WHOLLYPOSSESSED BY THEM AT THAT MOMENT DEBATE WAS MUTE WITHIN HER.

IT IS PERFECTLY SCANDALOUS. IFLADISLAW HAD HAD A SPARK OF HONOR HE WOULD HAVE GONE OUT OF THE COUNTRYAT ONCE AND NEVER SHOWN HIS FACE IN IT AGAIN. HOWEVER I AM NOTSURPRISED. THE DAY AFTER CASAUBONS FUNERAL I SAID WHAT OUGHT TO BEDONE. BUT I WAS NOT LISTENED TO.YOU WANTED WHAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE YOU KNOW CHETTAM SAID MR. BROOKE.YOU WANTED HIM SHIPPED OFF. I TOLD YOU LADISLAW WAS NOT TO BE DONE ASWE LIKED WITH HE HAD HIS IDEAS. HE WAS A REMARKABLE FELLOWI ALWAYSSAID HE WAS A REMARKABLE FELLOW.YES SAID SIR JAMES UNABLE TO REPRESS A RETORT IT IS RATHER A PITYYOU FORMED THAT HIGH OPINION OF HIM. WE ARE INDEBTED TO THAT FOR HISBEING LODGED IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. WE ARE INDEBTED TO THAT FOR SEEING AWOMAN LIKE DOROTHEA DEGRADING HERSELF BY MARRYING HIM. SIR JAMES MADELITTLE STOPPAGES BETWEEN HIS CLAUSES THE WORDS NOT COMING EASILY. AMAN SO MARKED OUT BY HER HUSBANDS WILL THAT DELICACY OUGHT TO HAVEFORBIDDEN HER FROM SEEING HIM AGAINWHO TAKES HER OUT OF HER PROPERRANKINTO POVERTYHAS THE MEANNESS TO ACCEPT SUCH A SACRIFICEHASALWAYS HAD AN OBJECTIONABLE POSITIONA BAD ORIGINAND I BELIEVE ISA MAN OF LITTLE PRINCIPLE AND LIGHT CHARACTER. THAT IS MY OPINION. SIRJAMES ENDED EMPHATICALLY TURNING ASIDE AND CROSSING HIS LEG.I POINTED EVERYTHING OUT TO HER SAID MR. BROOKE APOLOGETICALLYIMEAN THE POVERTY AND ABANDONING HER POSITION. I SAID MY DEAR YOUDONT KNOW WHAT IT IS TO LIVE ON SEVEN HUNDRED AYEAR AND HAVE NOCARRIAGE AND THAT KIND OF THING AND GO AMONGST PEOPLE WHO DONT KNOWWHO YOU ARE. I PUT IT STRONGLY TO HER. BUT I ADVISE YOU TO TALK TODOROTHEA HERSELF. THE FACT IS SHE HAS A DISLIKE TO CASAUBONSPROPERTY. YOU WILL HEAR WHAT SHE SAYS YOU KNOW.NOEXCUSE MEI SHALL NOT SAID SIR JAMES WITH MORE COOLNESS. ICANNOT BEAR TO SEE HER AGAIN IT IS TOO PAINFUL. IT HURTS ME TOO MUCHTHAT A WOMAN LIKE DOROTHEA SHOULD HAVE DONE WHAT IS WRONG.BE JUST CHETTAM SAID THE EASY LARGELIPPED RECTOR WHO OBJECTED TOALL THIS UNNECESSARY DISCOMFORT. MRS. CASAUBON MAY BE ACTINGIMPRUDENTLY SHE IS GIVING UP A FORTUNE FOR THE SAKE OF A MAN AND WEMEN HAVE SO POOR AN OPINION OF EACH OTHER THAT WE CAN HARDLY CALL AWOMAN WISE WHO DOES THAT. BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD NOT CONDEMN IT AS AWRONG ACTION IN THE STRICT SENSE OF THE WORD.YES I DO ANSWERED SIR JAMES. I THINK THAT DOROTHEA COMMITS A WRONGACTION IN MARRYING LADISLAW.MY DEAR FELLOW WE ARE RATHER APT TO CONSIDER AN ACT WRONG BECAUSE ITIS UNPLEASANT TO US SAID THE RECTOR QUIETLY. LIKE MANY MEN WHO TAKELIFE EASILY HE HAD THE KNACK OF SAYING A HOME TRUTH OCCASIONALLY TOTHOSE WHO FELT THEMSELVES VIRTUOUSLY OUT OF TEMPER. SIR JAMES TOOK OUTHIS HANDKERCHIEF AND BEGAN TO BITE THE CORNER.IT IS VERY DREADFUL OF DODO THOUGH SAID CELIA WISHING TO JUSTIFYHER HUSBAND. SHE SAID SHE NEVER WOULD MARRY AGAINNOT ANYBODY ATALL.I HEARD HER SAY THE SAME THING MYSELF SAID LADY CHETTAMMAJESTICALLY AS IF THIS WERE ROYAL EVIDENCE.OH THERE IS USUALLY A SILENT EXCEPTION IN SUCH CASES SAID MRS.CADWALLADER. THE ONLY WONDER TO ME IS THAT ANY OF YOU ARE SURPRISED.YOU DID NOTHING TO HINDER IT. IF YOU WOULD HAVE HAD LORD TRITON DOWNHERE TO WOO HER WITH HIS PHILANTHROPY HE MIGHT HAVE CARRIED HER OFFBEFORE THE YEAR WAS OVER. THERE WAS NO SAFETY IN ANYTHING ELSE. MR.CASAUBON HAD PREPARED ALL THIS AS BEAUTIFULLY AS POSSIBLE. HE MADEHIMSELF DISAGREEABLEOR IT PLEASED GOD TO MAKE HIM SOAND THEN HE DAREDHER TO CONTRADICT HIM. ITS THE WAY TO MAKE ANY TRUMPERY TEMPTING TOTICKET IT AT A HIGH PRICE IN THAT WAY.I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY WRONG CADWALLADER SAID SIR JAMESSTILL FEELING A LITTLE STUNG AND TURNING ROUND IN HIS CHAIR TOWARDSTHE RECTOR. HES NOT A MAN WE CAN TAKE INTO THE FAMILY. AT LEAST IMUST SPEAK FOR MYSELF HE CONTINUED CAREFULLY KEEPING HIS EYES OFFMR. BROOKE. I SUPPOSE OTHERS WILL FIND HIS SOCIETY TOO PLEASANT TOCARE ABOUT THE PROPRIETY OF THE THING.WELL YOU KNOW CHETTAM SAID MR. BROOKE GOODHUMOREDLY NURSING HISLEG I CANT TURN MY BACK ON DOROTHEA. I MUST BE A FATHER TO HER UP TOA CERTAIN POINT. I SAID MY DEAR I WONT REFUSE TO GIVE YOU AWAY. IHAD SPOKEN STRONGLY BEFORE. BUT I CAN CUT OFF THE ENTAIL YOU KNOW. ITWILL COST MONEY AND BE TROUBLESOME BUT I CAN DO IT YOU KNOW.MR. BROOKE NODDED AT SIR JAMES AND FELT THAT HE WAS BOTH SHOWING HISOWN FORCE OF RESOLUTION AND PROPITIATING WHAT WAS JUST IN THE BARONETSVEXATION. HE HAD HIT ON A MORE INGENIOUS MODE OF PARRYING THAN HE WASAWARE OF. HE HAD TOUCHED A MOTIVE OF WHICH SIR JAMES WAS ASHAMED. THEMASS OF HIS FEELING ABOUT DOROTHEAS MARRIAGE TO LADISLAW WAS DUEPARTLY TO EXCUSABLE PREJUDICE OR EVEN JUSTIFIABLE OPINION PARTLY TO AJEALOUS REPUGNANCE HARDLY LESS IN LADISLAWS CASE THAN IN CASAUBONS.HE WAS CONVINCED THAT THE MARRIAGE WAS A FATAL ONE FOR DOROTHEA. BUTAMID THAT MASS RAN A VEIN OF WHICH HE WAS TOO GOOD AND HONORABLE A MANTO LIKE THE AVOWAL EVEN TO HIMSELF IT WAS UNDENIABLE THAT THE UNION OFTHE TWO ESTATESTIPTON AND FRESHITTLYING CHARMINGLY WITHIN ARINGFENCE WAS A PROSPECT THAT FLATTERED HIM FOR HIS SON AND HEIR.HENCE WHEN MR. BROOKE NODDINGLY APPEALED TO THAT MOTIVE SIR JAMES FELTA SUDDEN EMBARRASSMENT THERE WAS A STOPPAGE IN HIS THROAT HE EVENBLUSHED. HE HAD FOUND MORE WORDS THAN USUAL IN THE FIRST JET OF HISANGER BUT MR. BROOKES PROPITIATION WAS MORE CLOGGING TO HIS TONGUETHAN MR. CADWALLADERS CAUSTIC HINT.BUT CELIA WAS GLAD TO HAVE ROOM FOR SPEECH AFTER HER UNCLES SUGGESTIONOF THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY AND SHE SAID THOUGH WITH AS LITTLE EAGERNESSOF MANNER AS IF THE QUESTION HAD TURNED ON AN INVITATION TO DINNER DOYOU MEAN THAT DODO IS GOING TO BE MARRIED DIRECTLY UNCLEIN THREE WEEKS YOU KNOW SAID MR. BROOKE HELPLESSLY. I CAN DONOTHING TO HINDER IT CADWALLADER HE ADDED TURNING FOR A LITTLECOUNTENANCE TOWARD THE RECTOR WHO SAIDI SHOULD NOT MAKE ANY FUSS ABOUT IT. IF SHE LIKES TO BE POOR THATIS HER AFFAIR. NOBODY WOULD HAVE SAID ANYTHING IF SHE HAD MARRIED THEYOUNG FELLOW BECAUSE HE WAS RICH. PLENTY OF BENEFICED CLERGY ARE POORERTHAN THEY WILL BE. HERE IS ELINOR CONTINUED THE PROVOKING HUSBANDSHE VEXED HER FRIENDS BY ME I HAD HARDLY A THOUSAND AYEARI WAS ALOUTNOBODY COULD SEE ANYTHING IN MEMY SHOES WERE NOT THE RIGHTCUTALL THE MEN WONDERED HOW A WOMAN COULD LIKE ME. UPON MY WORD IMUST TAKE LADISLAWS PART UNTIL I HEAR MORE HARM OF HIM.HUMPHREY THAT IS ALL SOPHISTRY AND YOU KNOW IT SAID HIS WIFE.EVERYTHING IS ALL ONETHAT IS THE BEGINNING AND END WITH YOU. AS IFYOU HAD NOT BEEN A CADWALLADER DOES ANY ONE SUPPOSE THAT I WOULD HAVETAKEN SUCH A MONSTER AS YOU BY ANY OTHER NAMEAND A CLERGYMAN TOO OBSERVED LADY CHETTAM WITH APPROBATION. ELINORCANNOT BE SAID TO HAVE DESCENDED BELOW HER RANK. IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAYWHAT MR. LADISLAW IS EH JAMESSIR JAMES GAVE A SMALL GRUNT WHICH WAS LESS RESPECTFUL THAN HIS USUALMODE OF ANSWERING HIS MOTHER. CELIA LOOKED UP AT HIM LIKE A THOUGHTFULKITTEN.IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT HIS BLOOD IS A FRIGHTFUL MIXTURE SAID MRS.CADWALLADER. THE CASAUBON CUTTLEFISH FLUID TO BEGIN WITH AND THEN AREBELLIOUS POLISH FIDDLER OR DANCINGMASTER WAS ITAND THEN AN OLDCLONONSENSE ELINOR SAID THE RECTOR RISING. IT IS TIME FOR US TO GO.AFTER ALL HE IS A PRETTY SPRIG SAID MRS. CADWALLADER RISING TOOAND WISHING TO MAKE AMENDS. HE IS LIKE THE FINE OLD CRICHLEY PORTRAITSBEFORE THE IDIOTS CAME IN.ILL GO WITH YOU SAID MR. BROOKE STARTING UP WITH ALACRITY. YOUMUST ALL COME AND DINE WITH ME TOMORROW YOU KNOWEH CELIA MY DEARYOU WILL JAMESWONT YOU SAID CELIA TAKING HER HUSBANDS HAND.OH OF COURSE IF YOU LIKE SAID SIR JAMES PULLING DOWN HISWAISTCOAT BUT UNABLE YET TO ADJUST HIS FACE GOODHUMOREDLY. THAT ISTO SAY IF IT IS NOT TO MEET ANYBODY ELSE.NO NO NO SAID MR. BROOKE UNDERSTANDING THE CONDITION. DOROTHEAWOULD NOT COME YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU HAD BEEN TO SEE HER.WHEN SIR JAMES AND CELIA WERE ALONE SHE SAID DO YOU MIND ABOUT MYHAVING THE CARRIAGE TO GO TO LOWICK JAMESWHAT NOW DIRECTLY HE ANSWERED WITH SOME SURPRISE.YES IT IS VERY IMPORTANT SAID CELIA.REMEMBER CELIA I CANNOT SEE HER SAID SIR JAMES.NOT IF SHE GAVE UP MARRYINGWHAT IS THE USE OF SAYING THATHOWEVER IM GOING TO THE STABLES.ILL TELL BRIGGS TO BRING THE CARRIAGE ROUND.CELIA THOUGHT IT WAS OF GREAT USE IF NOT TO SAY THAT AT LEAST TO TAKEA JOURNEY TO LOWICK IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE DOROTHEAS MIND. ALL THROUGHTHEIR GIRLHOOD SHE HAD FELT THAT SHE COULD ACT ON HER SISTER BY A WORDJUDICIOUSLY PLACEDBY OPENING A LITTLE WINDOW FOR THE DAYLIGHT OF HEROWN UNDERSTANDING TO ENTER AMONG THE STRANGE COLORED LAMPS BY WHICHDODO HABITUALLY SAW. AND CELIA THE MATRON NATURALLY FELT MORE ABLE TOADVISE HER CHILDLESS SISTER. HOW COULD ANY ONE UNDERSTAND DODO SO WELLAS CELIA DID OR LOVE HER SO TENDERLYDOROTHEA BUSY IN HER BOUDOIR FELT A GLOW OF PLEASURE AT THE SIGHT OFHER SISTER SO SOON AFTER THE REVELATION OF HER INTENDED MARRIAGE. SHEHAD PREFIGURED TO HERSELF EVEN WITH EXAGGERATION THE DISGUST OF HERFRIENDS AND SHE HAD EVEN FEARED THAT CELIA MIGHT BE KEPT ALOOF FROMHER.O KITTY I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU SAID DOROTHEA PUTTING HER HANDSON CELIAS SHOULDERS AND BEAMING ON HER. I ALMOST THOUGHT YOU WOULDNOT COME TO ME.I HAVE NOT BROUGHT ARTHUR BECAUSE I WAS IN A HURRY SAID CELIA ANDTHEY SAT DOWN ON TWO SMALL CHAIRS OPPOSITE EACH OTHER WITH THEIR KNEESTOUCHING.YOU KNOW DODO IT IS VERY BAD SAID CELIA IN HER PLACID GUTTURALLOOKING AS PRETTILY FREE FROM HUMORS AS POSSIBLE. YOU HAVEDISAPPOINTED US ALL SO. AND I CANT THINK THAT IT EVER WILL BEYOUNEVER CAN GO AND LIVE IN THAT WAY. AND THEN THERE ARE ALL YOUR PLANSYOU NEVER CAN HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT. JAMES WOULD HAVE TAKEN ANY TROUBLEFOR YOU AND YOU MIGHT HAVE GONE ON ALL YOUR LIFE DOING WHAT YOULIKED.ON THE CONTRARY DEAR SAID DOROTHEA I NEVER COULD DO ANYTHING THATI LIKED. I HAVE NEVER CARRIED OUT ANY PLAN YET.BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS WANTED THINGS THAT WOULDNT DO. BUT OTHER PLANSWOULD HAVE COME. AND HOW CAN YOU MARRY MR. LADISLAW THAT WE NONE OFUS EVER THOUGHT YOU COULD MARRY IT SHOCKS JAMES SO DREADFULLY. ANDTHEN IT IS ALL SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN. YOU WOULDHAVE MR. CASAUBON BECAUSE HE HAD SUCH A GREAT SOUL AND WAS SO OLD ANDDISMAL AND LEARNED AND NOW TO THINK OF MARRYING MR. LADISLAW WHO HASGOT NO ESTATE OR ANYTHING. I SUPPOSE IT IS BECAUSE YOU MUST BE MAKINGYOURSELF UNCOMFORTABLE IN SOME WAY OR OTHER.DOROTHEA LAUGHED.WELL IT IS VERY SERIOUS DODO SAID CELIA BECOMING MORE IMPRESSIVE.HOW WILL YOU LIVE AND YOU WILL GO AWAY AMONG QUEER PEOPLE. AND ISHALL NEVER SEE YOUAND YOU WONT MIND ABOUT LITTLE ARTHURAND ITHOUGHT YOU ALWAYS WOULDCELIAS RARE TEARS HAD GOT INTO HER EYES AND THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTHWERE AGITATED.DEAR CELIA SAID DOROTHEA WITH TENDER GRAVITY IF YOU DONT EVERSEE ME IT WILL NOT BE MY FAULT.YES IT WILL SAID CELIA WITH THE SAME TOUCHING DISTORTION OF HERSMALL FEATURES. HOW CAN I COME TO YOU OR HAVE YOU WITH ME WHEN JAMESCANT BEAR ITTHAT IS BECAUSE HE THINKS IT IS NOT RIGHTHE THINKS YOUARE SO WRONG DODO. BUT YOU ALWAYS WERE WRONG ONLY I CANT HELP LOVINGYOU. AND NOBODY CAN THINK WHERE YOU WILL LIVE WHERE CAN YOU GOI AM GOING TO LONDON SAID DOROTHEA.HOW CAN YOU ALWAYS LIVE IN A STREET AND YOU WILL BE SO POOR. I COULDGIVE YOU HALF MY THINGS ONLY HOW CAN I WHEN I NEVER SEE YOUBLESS YOU KITTY SAID DOROTHEA WITH GENTLE WARMTH. TAKE COMFORTPERHAPS JAMES WILL FORGIVE ME SOME TIME.BUT IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF YOU WOULD NOT BE MARRIED SAID CELIADRYING HER EYES AND RETURNING TO HER ARGUMENT THEN THERE WOULD BENOTHING UNCOMFORTABLE. AND YOU WOULD NOT DO WHAT NOBODY THOUGHT YOUCOULD DO. JAMES ALWAYS SAID YOU OUGHT TO BE A QUEEN BUT THIS IS NOT ATALL BEING LIKE A QUEEN. YOU KNOW WHAT MISTAKES YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEENMAKING DODO AND THIS IS ANOTHER. NOBODY THINKS MR. LADISLAW A PROPERHUSBAND FOR YOU. AND YOU SAID YOU WOULD NEVER BE MARRIED AGAIN.IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT I MIGHT BE A WISER PERSON CELIA SAIDDOROTHEA AND THAT I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING BETTER IF I HAD BEENBETTER. BUT THIS IS WHAT I AM GOING TO DO. I HAVE PROMISED TO MARRY MR.LADISLAW AND I AM GOING TO MARRY HIM.THE TONE IN WHICH DOROTHEA SAID THIS WAS A NOTE THAT CELIA HAD LONGLEARNED TO RECOGNIZE. SHE WAS SILENT A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN SAID ASIF SHE HAD DISMISSED ALL CONTEST IS HE VERY FOND OF YOU DODOI HOPE SO. I AM VERY FOND OF HIM.THAT IS NICE SAID CELIA COMFORTABLY. ONLY I WOULD RATHER YOU HADSUCH A SORT OF HUSBAND AS JAMES IS WITH A PLACE VERY NEAR THAT ICOULD DRIVE TO.DOROTHEA SMILED AND CELIA LOOKED RATHER MEDITATIVE. PRESENTLY SHESAID I CANNOT THINK HOW IT ALL CAME ABOUT. CELIA THOUGHT IT WOULD BEPLEASANT TO HEAR THE STORY.I DARE SAY NOT SAID DOROTHEA PINCHING HER SISTERS CHIN. IF YOUKNEW HOW IT CAME ABOUT IT WOULD NOT SEEM WONDERFUL TO YOU.CANT YOU TELL ME SAID CELIA SETTLING HER ARMS COZILY.NO DEAR YOU WOULD HAVE TO FEEL WITH ME ELSE YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW.CHAPTER LXXXV.THEN WENT THE JURY OUT WHOSE NAMES WERE MR.

HISEQUIVOCATIONS WITH HIMSELF ABOUT THE DEATH OF RAFFLES HAD SUSTAINED THECONCEPTION OF AN OMNISCIENCE WHOM HE PRAYED TO YET HE HAD A TERRORUPON HIM WHICH WOULD NOT LET HIM EXPOSE THEM TO JUDGMENT BY A FULLCONFESSION TO HIS WIFE THE ACTS WHICH HE HAD WASHED AND DILUTED WITHINWARD ARGUMENT AND MOTIVE AND FOR WHICH IT SEEMED COMPARATIVELY EASYTO WIN INVISIBLE PARDONWHAT NAME WOULD SHE CALL THEM BY THAT SHESHOULD EVER SILENTLY CALL HIS ACTS MURDER WAS WHAT HE COULD NOT BEAR.HE FELT SHROUDED BY HER DOUBT HE GOT STRENGTH TO FACE HER FROM THESENSE THAT SHE COULD NOT YET FEEL WARRANTED IN PRONOUNCING THAT WORSTCONDEMNATION ON HIM. SOME TIME PERHAPSWHEN HE WAS DYINGHE WOULD TELLHER ALL IN THE DEEP SHADOW OF THAT TIME WHEN SHE HELD HIS HAND IN THEGATHERING DARKNESS SHE MIGHT LISTEN WITHOUT RECOILING FROM HIS TOUCH.PERHAPS BUT CONCEALMENT HAD BEEN THE HABIT OF HIS LIFE AND THEIMPULSE TO CONFESSION HAD NO POWER AGAINST THE DREAD OF A DEEPERHUMILIATION.HE WAS FULL OF TIMID CARE FOR HIS WIFE NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE DEPRECATEDANY HARSHNESS OF JUDGMENT FROM HER BUT BECAUSE HE FELT A DEEP DISTRESSAT THE SIGHT OF HER SUFFERING. SHE HAD SENT HER DAUGHTERS AWAY TO BOARDAT A SCHOOL ON THE COAST THAT THIS CRISIS MIGHT BE HIDDEN FROM THEM ASFAR AS POSSIBLE. SET FREE BY THEIR ABSENCE FROM THE INTOLERABLENECESSITY OF ACCOUNTING FOR HER GRIEF OR OF BEHOLDING THEIR FRIGHTENEDWONDER SHE COULD LIVE UNCONSTRAINEDLY WITH THE SORROW THAT WAS EVERYDAY STREAKING HER HAIR WITH WHITENESS AND MAKING HER EYELIDS LANGUID.TELL ME ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ME DO HARRIETBULSTRODE HAD SAID TO HER I MEAN WITH REGARD TO ARRANGEMENTS OFPROPERTY. IT IS MY INTENTION NOT TO SELL THE LAND I POSSESS IN THISNEIGHBORHOOD BUT TO LEAVE IT TO YOU AS A SAFE PROVISION. IF YOU HAVEANY WISH ON SUCH SUBJECTS DO NOT CONCEAL IT FROM ME.A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE HAD RETURNED FROM A VISIT TO HERBROTHERS SHE BEGAN TO SPEAK TO HER HUSBAND ON A SUBJECT WHICH HAD FORSOME TIME BEEN IN HER MIND.I SHOULD LIKE TO DO SOMETHING FOR MY BROTHERS FAMILY NICHOLAS ANDI THINK WE ARE BOUND TO MAKE SOME AMENDS TO ROSAMOND AND HER HUSBAND.WALTER SAYS MR. LYDGATE MUST LEAVE THE TOWN AND HIS PRACTICE IS ALMOSTGOOD FOR NOTHING AND THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE LEFT TO SETTLE ANYWHEREWITH. I WOULD RATHER DO WITHOUT SOMETHING FOR OURSELVES TO MAKE SOMEAMENDS TO MY POOR BROTHERS FAMILY.MRS. BULSTRODE DID NOT WISH TO GO NEARER TO THE FACTS THAN IN THEPHRASE MAKE SOME AMENDS KNOWING THAT HER HUSBAND MUST UNDERSTANDHER. HE HAD A PARTICULAR REASON WHICH SHE WAS NOT AWARE OF FORWINCING UNDER HER SUGGESTION. HE HESITATED BEFORE HE SAIDIT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT YOUR WISH IN THE WAY YOU PROPOSE MYDEAR. MR. LYDGATE HAS VIRTUALLY REJECTED ANY FURTHER SERVICE FROM ME.HE HAS RETURNED THE THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH I LENT HIM. MRS. CASAUBONADVANCED HIM THE SUM FOR THAT PURPOSE. HERE IS HIS LETTER.THE LETTER SEEMED TO CUT MRS. BULSTRODE SEVERELY. THE MENTION OF MRS.CASAUBONS LOAN SEEMED A REFLECTION OF THAT PUBLIC FEELING WHICH HELDIT A MATTER OF COURSE THAT EVERY ONE WOULD AVOID A CONNECTION WITH HERHUSBAND. SHE WAS SILENT FOR SOME TIME AND THE TEARS FELL ONE AFTER THEOTHER HER CHIN TREMBLING AS SHE WIPED THEM AWAY. BULSTRODE SITTINGOPPOSITE TO HER ACHED AT THE SIGHT OF THAT GRIEFWORN FACE WHICH TWOMONTHS BEFORE HAD BEEN BRIGHT AND BLOOMING. IT HAD AGED TO KEEP SADCOMPANY WITH HIS OWN WITHERED FEATURES. URGED INTO SOME EFFORT ATCOMFORTING HER HE SAIDTHERE IS ANOTHER MEANS HARRIET BY WHICH I MIGHT DO A SERVICE TO YOURBROTHERS FAMILY IF YOU LIKE TO ACT IN IT.

THE STOCK WAS TO REMAIN AS ITIS AND THEY WERE TO PAY A CERTAIN SHARE OF THE PROFITS INSTEAD OF ANORDINARY RENT. THAT WOULD BE A DESIRABLE BEGINNING FOR THE YOUNG MANIN CONJUNCTION WITH HIS EMPLOYMENT UNDER GARTH. WOULD IT BE ASATISFACTION TO YOUYES IT WOULD SAID MRS. BULSTRODE WITH SOME RETURN OF ENERGY. POORWALTER IS SO CAST DOWN I WOULD TRY ANYTHING IN MY POWER TO DO HIM SOMEGOOD BEFORE I GO AWAY. WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BROTHER AND SISTER.YOU MUST MAKE THE PROPOSAL TO GARTH YOURSELF HARRIET SAID MR.BULSTRODE NOT LIKING WHAT HE HAD TO SAY BUT DESIRING THE END HE HADIN VIEW FOR OTHER REASONS BESIDES THE CONSOLATION OF HIS WIFE. YOUMUST STATE TO HIM THAT THE LAND IS VIRTUALLY YOURS AND THAT HE NEEDHAVE NO TRANSACTIONS WITH ME. COMMUNICATIONS CAN BE MADE THROUGHSTANDISH. I MENTION THIS BECAUSE GARTH GAVE UP BEING MY AGENT.

TELL MESERIOUSLY THAT ALL THIS IS TRUE AND THAT YOU ARE HAPPY BECAUSE OFITBECAUSE YOU LOVE ME BEST.IT IS ALL TRUE FRED AND I AM HAPPY BECAUSE OF ITBECAUSE I LOVE YOUBEST SAID MARY IN A TONE OF OBEDIENT RECITATION.THEY LINGERED ON THE DOORSTEP UNDER THE STEEPROOFED PORCH AND FREDALMOST IN A WHISPER SAIDWHEN WE WERE FIRST ENGAGED WITH THE UMBRELLARING MARY YOU USEDTOTHE SPIRIT OF JOY BEGAN TO LAUGH MORE DECIDEDLY IN MARYS EYES BUT THEFATAL BEN CAME RUNNING TO THE DOOR WITH BROWNIE YAPPING BEHIND HIMAND BOUNCING AGAINST THEM SAIDFRED AND MARY ARE YOU EVER COMING INOR MAY I EAT YOUR CAKEFINALE.EVERY LIMIT IS A BEGINNING AS WELL AS AN ENDING. WHO CAN QUIT YOUNGLIVES AFTER BEING LONG IN COMPANY WITH THEM AND NOT DESIRE TO KNOWWHAT BEFELL THEM IN THEIR AFTERYEARS FOR THE FRAGMENT OF A LIFEHOWEVER TYPICAL IS NOT THE SAMPLE OF AN EVEN WEB PROMISES MAY NOT BEKEPT AND AN ARDENT OUTSET MAY BE FOLLOWED BY DECLENSION LATENT POWERSMAY FIND THEIR LONGWAITED OPPORTUNITY A PAST ERROR MAY URGE A GRANDRETRIEVAL.MARRIAGE WHICH HAS BEEN THE BOURNE OF SO MANY NARRATIVES IS STILL AGREAT BEGINNING AS IT WAS TO ADAM AND EVE WHO KEPT THEIR HONEYMOON INEDEN BUT HAD THEIR FIRST LITTLE ONE AMONG THE THORNS AND THISTLES OFTHE WILDERNESS. IT IS STILL THE BEGINNING OF THE HOME EPICTHE GRADUALCONQUEST OR IRREMEDIABLE LOSS OF THAT COMPLETE UNION WHICH MAKES THEADVANCING YEARS A CLIMAX AND AGE THE HARVEST OF SWEET MEMORIES INCOMMON.SOME SET OUT LIKE CRUSADERS OF OLD WITH A GLORIOUS EQUIPMENT OF HOPEAND ENTHUSIASM AND GET BROKEN BY THE WAY WANTING PATIENCE WITH EACHOTHER AND THE WORLD.ALL WHO HAVE CARED FOR FRED VINCY AND MARY GARTH WILL LIKE TO KNOW THATTHESE TWO MADE NO SUCH FAILURE BUT ACHIEVED A SOLID MUTUAL HAPPINESS.FRED SURPRISED HIS NEIGHBORS IN VARIOUS WAYS. HE BECAME RATHERDISTINGUISHED IN HIS SIDE OF THE COUNTY AS A THEORETIC AND PRACTICALFARMER AND PRODUCED A WORK ON THE CULTIVATION OF GREEN CROPS AND THEECONOMY OF CATTLEFEEDING WHICH WON HIM HIGH CONGRATULATIONS ATAGRICULTURAL MEETINGS. IN MIDDLEMARCH ADMIRATION WAS MORE RESERVEDMOST PERSONS THERE WERE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE MERIT OF FREDSAUTHORSHIP WAS DUE TO HIS WIFE SINCE THEY HAD NEVER EXPECTED FREDVINCY TO WRITE ON TURNIPS AND MANGELWURZEL.BUT WHEN MARY WROTE A LITTLE BOOK FOR HER BOYS CALLED STORIES OFGREAT MEN TAKEN FROM PLUTARCH AND HAD IT PRINTED AND PUBLISHED BYGRIPP  CO. MIDDLEMARCH EVERY ONE IN THE TOWN WAS WILLING TO GIVE THECREDIT OF THIS WORK TO FRED OBSERVING THAT HE HAD BEEN TO THEUNIVERSITY WHERE THE ANCIENTS WERE STUDIED AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACLERGYMAN IF HE HAD CHOSEN.IN THIS WAY IT WAS MADE CLEAR THAT MIDDLEMARCH HAD NEVER BEEN DECEIVEDAND THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO PRAISE ANYBODY FOR WRITING A BOOK SINCEIT WAS ALWAYS DONE BY SOMEBODY ELSE.MOREOVER FRED REMAINED UNSWERVINGLY STEADY. SOME YEARS AFTER HISMARRIAGE HE TOLD MARY THAT HIS HAPPINESS WAS HALF OWING TO FAREBROTHERWHO GAVE HIM A STRONG PULLUP AT THE RIGHT MOMENT. I CANNOT SAY THAT HEWAS NEVER AGAIN MISLED BY HIS HOPEFULNESS THE YIELD OF CROPS OR THEPROFITS OF A CATTLE SALE USUALLY FELL BELOW HIS ESTIMATE AND HE WASALWAYS PRONE TO BELIEVE THAT HE COULD MAKE MONEY BY THE PURCHASE OF AHORSE WHICH TURNED OUT BADLYTHOUGH THIS MARY OBSERVED WAS OF COURSETHE FAULT OF THE HORSE NOT OF FREDS JUDGMENT. HE KEPT HIS LOVE OFHORSEMANSHIP BUT HE RARELY ALLOWED HIMSELF A DAYS HUNTING AND WHENHE DID SO IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT HE SUBMITTED TO BE LAUGHED AT FORCOWARDLINESS AT THE FENCES SEEMING TO SEE MARY AND THE BOYS SITTING ONTHE FIVEBARRED GATE OR SHOWING THEIR CURLY HEADS BETWEEN HEDGE ANDDITCH.THERE WERE THREE BOYS MARY WAS NOT DISCONTENTED THAT SHE BROUGHT FORTHMENCHILDREN ONLY AND WHEN FRED WISHED TO HAVE A GIRL LIKE HER SHESAID LAUGHINGLY THAT WOULD BE TOO GREAT A TRIAL TO YOUR MOTHER.MRS. VINCY IN HER DECLINING YEARS AND IN THE DIMINISHED LUSTRE OF HERHOUSEKEEPING WAS MUCH COMFORTED BY HER PERCEPTION THAT TWO AT LEAST OFFREDS BOYS WERE REAL VINCYS AND DID NOT FEATURE THE GARTHS. BUTMARY SECRETLY REJOICED THAT THE YOUNGEST OF THE THREE WAS VERY MUCHWHAT HER FATHER MUST HAVE BEEN WHEN HE WORE A ROUND JACKET AND SHOWEDA MARVELLOUS NICETY OF AIM IN PLAYING AT MARBLES OR IN THROWING STONESTO BRING DOWN THE MELLOW PEARS.BEN AND LETTY GARTH WHO WERE UNCLE AND AUNT BEFORE THEY WERE WELL INTHEIR TEENS DISPUTED MUCH AS TO WHETHER NEPHEWS OR NIECES WERE MOREDESIRABLE BEN CONTENDING THAT IT WAS CLEAR GIRLS WERE GOOD FOR LESSTHAN BOYS ELSE THEY WOULD NOT BE ALWAYS IN PETTICOATS WHICH SHOWEDHOW LITTLE THEY WERE MEANT FOR WHEREUPON LETTY WHO ARGUED MUCH FROMBOOKS GOT ANGRY IN REPLYING THAT GOD MADE COATS OF SKINS FOR BOTH ADAMAND EVE ALIKEALSO IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT IN THE EAST THE MEN TOO WOREPETTICOATS. BUT THIS LATTER ARGUMENT OBSCURING THE MAJESTY OF THEFORMER WAS ONE TOO MANY FOR BEN ANSWERED CONTEMPTUOUSLY THE MORESPOONEYS THEY AND IMMEDIATELY APPEALED TO HIS MOTHER WHETHER BOYSWERE NOT BETTER THAN GIRLS. MRS. GARTH PRONOUNCED THAT BOTH WERE ALIKENAUGHTY BUT THAT BOYS WERE UNDOUBTEDLY STRONGER COULD RUN FASTER ANDTHROW WITH MORE PRECISION TO A GREATER DISTANCE. WITH THIS ORACULARSENTENCE BEN WAS WELL SATISFIED NOT MINDING THE NAUGHTINESS BUT LETTYTOOK IT ILL HER FEELING OF SUPERIORITY BEING STRONGER THAN HERMUSCLES.FRED NEVER BECAME RICHHIS HOPEFULNESS HAD NOT LED HIM TO EXPECT THATBUT HE GRADUALLY SAVED ENOUGH TO BECOME OWNER OF THE STOCK ANDFURNITURE AT STONE COURT AND THE WORK WHICH MR. GARTH PUT INTO HISHANDS CARRIED HIM IN PLENTY THROUGH THOSE BAD TIMES WHICH ARE ALWAYSPRESENT WITH FARMERS. MARY IN HER MATRONLY DAYS BECAME AS SOLID INFIGURE AS HER MOTHER BUT UNLIKE HER GAVE THE BOYS LITTLE FORMALTEACHING SO THAT MRS. GARTH WAS ALARMED LEST THEY SHOULD NEVER BE WELLGROUNDED IN GRAMMAR AND GEOGRAPHY. NEVERTHELESS THEY WERE FOUND QUITEFORWARD ENOUGH WHEN THEY WENT TO SCHOOL PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY HADLIKED NOTHING SO WELL AS BEING WITH THEIR MOTHER. WHEN FRED WAS RIDINGHOME ON WINTER EVENINGS HE HAD A PLEASANT VISION BEFOREHAND OF THEBRIGHT HEARTH IN THE WAINSCOTED PARLOR AND WAS SORRY FOR OTHER MEN WHOCOULD NOT HAVE MARY FOR THEIR WIFE ESPECIALLY FOR MR. FAREBROTHER. HEWAS TEN TIMES WORTHIER OF YOU THAN I WAS FRED COULD NOW SAY TO HERMAGNANIMOUSLY. TO BE SURE HE WAS MARY ANSWERED AND FOR THAT REASONHE COULD DO BETTER WITHOUT ME. BUT YOUI SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT YOUWOULD HAVE BEENA CURATE IN DEBT FOR HORSEHIRE AND CAMBRICPOCKETHANDKERCHIEFSON INQUIRY IT MIGHT POSSIBLY BE FOUND THAT FRED AND MARY STILL INHABITSTONE COURTTHAT THE CREEPING PLANTS STILL CAST THE FOAM OF THEIRBLOSSOMS OVER THE FINE STONEWALL INTO THE FIELD WHERE THE WALNUTTREESSTAND IN STATELY ROWAND THAT ON SUNNY DAYS THE TWO LOVERS WHO WEREFIRST ENGAGED WITH THE UMBRELLARING MAY BE SEEN IN WHITEHAIREDPLACIDITY AT THE OPEN WINDOW FROM WHICH MARY GARTH IN THE DAYS OF OLDPETER FEATHERSTONE HAD OFTEN BEEN ORDERED TO LOOK OUT FOR MR. LYDGATE.LYDGATES HAIR NEVER BECAME WHITE. HE DIED WHEN HE WAS ONLY FIFTYLEAVING HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN PROVIDED FOR BY A HEAVY INSURANCE ON HISLIFE. HE HAD GAINED AN EXCELLENT PRACTICE ALTERNATING ACCORDING TOTHE SEASON BETWEEN LONDON AND A CONTINENTAL BATHINGPLACE HAVINGWRITTEN A TREATISE ON GOUT A DISEASE WHICH HAS A GOOD DEAL OF WEALTHON ITS SIDE. HIS SKILL WAS RELIED ON BY MANY PAYING PATIENTS BUT HEALWAYS REGARDED HIMSELF AS A FAILURE HE HAD NOT DONE WHAT HE ONCEMEANT TO DO. HIS ACQUAINTANCES THOUGHT HIM ENVIABLE TO HAVE SO CHARMINGA WIFE AND NOTHING HAPPENED TO SHAKE THEIR OPINION. ROSAMOND NEVERCOMMITTED A SECOND COMPROMISING INDISCRETION. SHE SIMPLY CONTINUED TOBE MILD IN HER TEMPER INFLEXIBLE IN HER JUDGMENT DISPOSED TO ADMONISHHER HUSBAND AND ABLE TO FRUSTRATE HIM BY STRATAGEM. AS THE YEARS WENTON HE OPPOSED HER LESS AND LESS WHENCE ROSAMOND CONCLUDED THAT HE HADLEARNED THE VALUE OF HER OPINION ON THE OTHER HAND SHE HAD A MORETHOROUGH CONVICTION OF HIS TALENTS NOW THAT HE GAINED A GOOD INCOMEAND INSTEAD OF THE THREATENED CAGE IN BRIDE STREET PROVIDED ONE ALLFLOWERS AND GILDING FIT FOR THE BIRD OF PARADISE THAT SHE RESEMBLED.IN BRIEF LYDGATE WAS WHAT IS CALLED A SUCCESSFUL MAN. BUT HE DIEDPREMATURELY OF DIPHTHERIA AND ROSAMOND AFTERWARDS MARRIED AN ELDERLYAND WEALTHY PHYSICIAN WHO TOOK KINDLY TO HER FOUR CHILDREN. SHE MADE AVERY PRETTY SHOW WITH HER DAUGHTERS DRIVING OUT IN HER CARRIAGE ANDOFTEN SPOKE OF HER HAPPINESS AS A REWARDSHE DID NOT SAY FOR WHATBUT PROBABLY SHE MEANT THAT IT WAS A REWARD FOR HER PATIENCE WITHTERTIUS WHOSE TEMPER NEVER BECAME FAULTLESS AND TO THE LASTOCCASIONALLY LET SLIP A BITTER SPEECH WHICH WAS MORE MEMORABLE THAN THESIGNS HE MADE OF HIS REPENTANCE. HE ONCE CALLED HER HIS BASIL PLANTAND WHEN SHE ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION SAID THAT BASIL WAS A PLANTWHICH HAD FLOURISHED WONDERFULLY ON A MURDERED MANS BRAINS. ROSAMONDHAD A PLACID BUT STRONG ANSWER TO SUCH SPEECHES. WHY THEN HAD HE CHOSENHER IT WAS A PITY HE HAD NOT HAD MRS. LADISLAW WHOM HE WAS ALWAYSPRAISING AND PLACING ABOVE HER. AND THUS THE CONVERSATION ENDED WITHTHE ADVANTAGE ON ROSAMONDS SIDE. BUT IT WOULD BE UNJUST NOT TO TELLTHAT SHE NEVER UTTERED A WORD IN DEPRECIATION OF DOROTHEA KEEPING INRELIGIOUS REMEMBRANCE THE GENEROSITY WHICH HAD COME TO HER AID IN THESHARPEST CRISIS OF HER LIFE.DOROTHEA HERSELF HAD NO DREAMS OF BEING PRAISED ABOVE OTHER WOMENFEELING THAT THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING BETTER WHICH SHE MIGHT HAVEDONE IF SHE HAD ONLY BEEN BETTER AND KNOWN BETTER. STILL SHE NEVERREPENTED THAT SHE HAD GIVEN UP POSITION AND FORTUNE TO MARRY WILLLADISLAW AND HE WOULD HAVE HELD IT THE GREATEST SHAME AS WELL ASSORROW TO HIM IF SHE HAD REPENTED. THEY WERE BOUND TO EACH OTHER BY ALOVE STRONGER THAN ANY IMPULSES WHICH COULD HAVE MARRED IT. NO LIFEWOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO DOROTHEA WHICH WAS NOT FILLED WITH EMOTIONAND SHE HAD NOW A LIFE FILLED ALSO WITH A BENEFICENT ACTIVITY WHICH SHEHAD NOT THE DOUBTFUL PAINS OF DISCOVERING AND MARKING OUT FOR HERSELF.WILL BECAME AN ARDENT PUBLIC MAN WORKING WELL IN THOSE TIMES WHENREFORMS WERE BEGUN WITH A YOUNG HOPEFULNESS OF IMMEDIATE GOOD WHICH HASBEEN MUCH CHECKED IN OUR DAYS AND GETTING AT LAST RETURNED TOPARLIAMENT BY A CONSTITUENCY WHO PAID HIS EXPENSES. DOROTHEA COULD HAVELIKED NOTHING BETTER SINCE WRONGS EXISTED THAN THAT HER HUSBANDSHOULD BE IN THE THICK OF A STRUGGLE AGAINST THEM AND THAT SHE SHOULDGIVE HIM WIFELY HELP. MANY WHO KNEW HER THOUGHT IT A PITY THAT SOSUBSTANTIVE AND RARE A CREATURE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABSORBED INTO THE LIFEOF ANOTHER AND BE ONLY KNOWN IN A CERTAIN CIRCLE AS A WIFE AND MOTHER.BUT NO ONE STATED EXACTLY WHAT ELSE THAT WAS IN HER POWER SHE OUGHTRATHER TO HAVE DONENOT EVEN SIR JAMES CHETTAM WHO WENT NO FURTHERTHAN THE NEGATIVE PRESCRIPTION THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE MARRIED WILLLADISLAW.BUT THIS OPINION OF HIS DID NOT CAUSE A LASTING ALIENATION AND THE WAYIN WHICH THE FAMILY WAS MADE WHOLE AGAIN WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF ALLCONCERNED. MR. BROOKE COULD NOT RESIST THE PLEASURE OF CORRESPONDINGWITH WILL AND DOROTHEA AND ONE MORNING WHEN HIS PEN HAD BEENREMARKABLY FLUENT ON THE PROSPECTS OF MUNICIPAL REFORM IT RAN OFF INTOAN INVITATION TO THE GRANGE WHICH ONCE WRITTEN COULD NOT BE DONEAWAY WITH AT LESS COST THAN THE SACRIFICE HARDLY TO BE CONCEIVED OFTHE WHOLE VALUABLE LETTER. DURING THE MONTHS OF THIS CORRESPONDENCE MR.BROOKE HAD CONTINUALLY IN HIS TALK WITH SIR JAMES CHETTAM BEENPRESUPPOSING OR HINTING THAT THE INTENTION OF CUTTING OFF THE ENTAILWAS STILL MAINTAINED AND THE DAY ON WHICH HIS PEN GAVE THE DARINGINVITATION HE WENT TO FRESHITT EXPRESSLY TO INTIMATE THAT HE HAD ASTRONGER SENSE THAN EVER OF THE REASONS FOR TAKING THAT ENERGETIC STEPAS A PRECAUTION AGAINST ANY MIXTURE OF LOW BLOOD IN THE HEIR OF THEBROOKES.BUT THAT MORNING SOMETHING EXCITING HAD HAPPENED AT THE HALL. A LETTERHAD COME TO CELIA WHICH MADE HER CRY SILENTLY AS SHE READ IT AND WHENSIR JAMES UNUSED TO SEE HER IN TEARS ASKED ANXIOUSLY WHAT WAS THEMATTER SHE BURST OUT IN A WAIL SUCH AS HE HAD NEVER HEARD FROM HERBEFORE.DOROTHEA HAS A LITTLE BOY. AND YOU WILL NOT LET ME GO AND SEE HER. ANDI AM SURE SHE WANTS TO SEE ME. AND SHE WILL NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITHTHE BABYSHE WILL DO WRONG THINGS WITH IT. AND THEY THOUGHT SHE WOULDDIE. IT IS VERY DREADFUL SUPPOSE IT HAD BEEN ME AND LITTLE ARTHUR ANDDODO HAD BEEN HINDERED FROM COMING TO SEE ME I WISH YOU WOULD BE LESSUNKIND JAMESGOOD HEAVENS CELIA SAID SIR JAMES MUCH WROUGHT UPON WHAT DO YOUWISH I WILL DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE. I WILL TAKE YOU TO TOWN TOMORROW IFYOU WISH IT. AND CELIA DID WISH IT.IT WAS AFTER THIS THAT MR. BROOKE CAME AND MEETING THE BARONET IN THEGROUNDS BEGAN TO CHAT WITH HIM IN IGNORANCE OF THE NEWS WHICH SIRJAMES FOR SOME REASON DID NOT CARE TO TELL HIM IMMEDIATELY. BUT WHENTHE ENTAIL WAS TOUCHED ON IN THE USUAL WAY HE SAID MY DEAR SIR ITIS NOT FOR ME TO DICTATE TO YOU BUT FOR MY PART I WOULD LET THATALONE. I WOULD LET THINGS REMAIN AS THEY ARE.MR. BROOKE FELT SO MUCH SURPRISED THAT HE DID NOT AT ONCE FIND OUT HOWMUCH HE WAS RELIEVED BY THE SENSE THAT HE WAS NOT EXPECTED TO DOANYTHING IN PARTICULAR.SUCH BEING THE BENT OF CELIAS HEART IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT SIR JAMESSHOULD CONSENT TO A RECONCILIATION WITH DOROTHEA AND HER HUSBAND. WHEREWOMEN LOVE EACH OTHER MEN LEARN TO SMOTHER THEIR MUTUAL DISLIKE. SIRJAMES NEVER LIKED LADISLAW AND WILL ALWAYS PREFERRED TO HAVE SIRJAMESS COMPANY MIXED WITH ANOTHER KIND THEY WERE ON A FOOTING OFRECIPROCAL TOLERANCE WHICH WAS MADE QUITE EASY ONLY WHEN DOROTHEA ANDCELIA WERE PRESENT.IT BECAME AN UNDERSTOOD THING THAT MR. AND MRS. LADISLAW SHOULD PAY ATLEAST TWO VISITS DURING THE YEAR TO THE GRANGE AND THERE CAMEGRADUALLY A SMALL ROW OF COUSINS AT FRESHITT WHO ENJOYED PLAYING WITHTHE TWO COUSINS VISITING TIPTON AS MUCH AS IF THE BLOOD OF THESECOUSINS HAD BEEN LESS DUBIOUSLY MIXED.MR. BROOKE LIVED TO A GOOD OLD AGE AND HIS ESTATE WAS INHERITED BYDOROTHEAS SON WHO MIGHT HAVE REPRESENTED MIDDLEMARCH BUT DECLINEDTHINKING THAT HIS OPINIONS HAD LESS CHANCE OF BEING STIFLED IF HEREMAINED OUT OF DOORS.SIR JAMES NEVER CEASED TO REGARD DOROTHEAS SECOND MARRIAGE AS AMISTAKE AND INDEED THIS REMAINED THE TRADITION CONCERNING IT INMIDDLEMARCH WHERE SHE WAS SPOKEN OF TO A YOUNGER GENERATION AS A FINEGIRL WHO MARRIED A SICKLY CLERGYMAN OLD ENOUGH TO BE HER FATHER ANDIN LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER HIS DEATH GAVE UP HER ESTATE TO MARRYHIS COUSINYOUNG ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN HIS SON WITH NO PROPERTY AND NOTWELLBORN. THOSE WHO HAD NOT SEEN ANYTHING OF DOROTHEA USUALLY OBSERVEDTHAT SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A NICE WOMAN ELSE SHE WOULD NOT HAVEMARRIED EITHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER.CERTAINLY THOSE DETERMINING ACTS OF HER LIFE WERE NOT IDEALLYBEAUTIFUL. THEY WERE THE MIXED RESULT OF YOUNG AND NOBLE IMPULSESTRUGGLING AMIDST THE CONDITIONS OF AN IMPERFECT SOCIAL STATE IN WHICHGREAT FEELINGS WILL OFTEN TAKE THE ASPECT OF ERROR AND GREAT FAITH THEASPECT OF ILLUSION. FOR THERE IS NO CREATURE WHOSE INWARD BEING IS SOSTRONG THAT IT IS NOT GREATLY DETERMINED BY WHAT LIES OUTSIDE IT. A NEWTHERESA WILL HARDLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF REFORMING A CONVENTUALLIFE ANY MORE THAN A NEW ANTIGONE WILL SPEND HER HEROIC PIETY INDARING ALL FOR THE SAKE OF A BROTHERS BURIAL THE MEDIUM IN WHICHTHEIR ARDENT DEEDS TOOK SHAPE IS FOREVER GONE. BUT WE INSIGNIFICANTPEOPLE WITH OUR DAILY WORDS AND ACTS ARE PREPARING THE LIVES OF MANYDOROTHEAS SOME OF WHICH MAY PRESENT A FAR SADDER SACRIFICE THAN THATOF THE DOROTHEA WHOSE STORY WE KNOW.HER FINELY TOUCHED SPIRIT HAD STILL ITS FINE ISSUES THOUGH THEY WERENOT WIDELY VISIBLE. HER FULL NATURE LIKE THAT RIVER OF WHICH CYRUSBROKE THE STRENGTH SPENT ITSELF IN CHANNELS WHICH HAD NO GREAT NAME ONTHE EARTH. BUT THE EFFECT OF HER BEING ON THOSE AROUND HER WASINCALCULABLY DIFFUSIVE FOR THE GROWING GOOD OF THE WORLD IS PARTLYDEPENDENT ON UNHISTORIC ACTS AND THAT THINGS ARE NOT SO ILL WITH YOUAND ME AS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN IS HALF OWING TO THE NUMBER WHO LIVEDFAITHFULLY A HIDDEN LIFE AND REST IN UNVISITED TOMBS.THE END END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MIDDLEMARCH     UPDATED EDITIONS WILL REPLACE THE PREVIOUS ONETHE OLD EDITIONS WILLBE RENAMED.CREATING THE WORKS FROM PRINT EDITIONS NOT PROTECTED BY U.S. COPYRIGHTLAW MEANS THAT NO ONE OWNS A UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT IN THESE WORKSSO THE FOUNDATION AND YOU CAN COPY AND DISTRIBUTE IT IN THE UNITEDSTATES WITHOUT PERMISSION AND WITHOUT PAYING COPYRIGHTROYALTIES.
